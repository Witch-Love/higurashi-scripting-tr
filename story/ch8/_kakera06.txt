`Satoshi-kun is a good brother who takes great care of his sister.`
`He went to visit Satoko-chan straight after school and kept encouraging her to get better every day.`
`Without even hearing Satoshi-kun's stories, it's obvious to me that Satoko-chan never had a good relationship with her step-parents...`
`She especially didn't get along with her stepfather. Satoko-chan even called a child abuse hotline once.`
`Not only that, her parents ended up dying in an accident, so she just wasn't able to withstand all that damage.`
`Satoko-chan is still very young, so everything must have been horrible for her to go through.`
` ......Fortunately, she has a wonderful brother.`
`Emotional wounds are hard to heal.`
`But nothing heals those wounds better than love from family members.`
`I'm sure that one day, Satoko-chan will be able to smile again.`
`She's still in shock, but when she talks to Satoshi-kun, she smiles a little bit.`
`...Ooishi from the police department keeps requesting to see her, but I think I need to protect her for just a little longer.`
`...While he's passionate about his job, I wish he'd be a touch more sensitive.`
`If he reminds her of her parents' accident, her emotional wounds will start to open again.`
`...That's the one point I worry about with Satoko-chan.`
`I heard someone knocking on the door.`
`...It was Takano-san.`
`...It doesn't look right, wearing a nurse's uniform like that.`
`She's a licensed doctor, so she should wear a white coat and act like one.`
`Maybe this is fun for her, but I think she might be insulting the real nurses...`
` I didn't say anything, though.`
`"Dr. Irie, may I talk to you?"`
`"Oh, yes.`
` Well, Satoshi-kun, if you'll excuse me."`
`"Ah, sure."`
`"Hello, Satoshi-kun.`
` Please keep Satoko-chan company.`
` She's always alone, so I bet she's lonely.`
` Okay?"`
`"O-Oh no, that's not true."`
`"Mmph."`
`"Okay Satoshi-kun, you're in charge."`
`I got up and let Satoshi-kun take over.`
`"Did something happen?"`
`"Not right here, let's go to your office.`
` Hee hee."`
`Takano-san smiled meaningfully.`
`Usually, smiles bring happy feelings.`
`But when it comes to Takano-san, that's rarely the case.`
`"...Are you sure?"`
`"Yes.`
` The initial test results show there's a possibility she's at L3 or above.`
` We need to keep her here and run some more tests.`
`The results aren't in yet, but from what I can see, it's very possible that she's at L4."`
`Takano-san's eyes sparkled in a weird way.`
`There's a reason for that.`
`......For us, finding patients in the terminal stage is a valuable boon to our research.`
`In fact, as a result of dissecting the murder suspect from last year, we've made great progress in our research.`
`In other words, we finally managed to isolate the pathogen.`
`We also discovered that when the host dies, the pathogen melts away within a few hours.`
`Once that happens, it's undetectable.`
`That's why we never found the pathogen when we performed autopsies.`
`Our research made a lot of progress after that.`
`What we've found in this past year has easily surpassed what the late Dr. Takano found in decades.`
`We're now studying the nature, the effect, and the symptoms of the pathogen, as well as treatments and vaccines.`
`In other words, a living specimen who's at the terminal stage is a necessity for our research.`
`However, we rarely find a patient who's gone that far. Who's reached L5.`
`Hinamizawa Syndrome once created huge numbers of L5 patients, but today, it doesn't have such potency.`
`Because of that, we have to secure L5 patients, or patients who are close to reaching L5, as quickly as possible.`
`......Satoko-chan possibly qualifies to be that next sacrifice.`
`To keep this strange disease a secret, we can't let patients who may be at L5 go.`
`We have to run more tests first,`
` then we'll figure out what to do next.`
`In any case, Satoko-chan seems so calm.`
` Her behavior is nothing like the man from last year.`
`Initial tests are in error sometimes.`
`We'll have to wait for the results of more detailed tests to determine how serious her condition is.`
`"...Okay."`
`"Let's admit her for observation.`
` Please let the staff know to get things ready."`
`That sounds like a formal answer, but if the results come back positive, that will be the green light for her dissection.`
`I don't know Satoko-chan that well,`
` but I've known her brother, Satoshi-kun, through the baseball team for a long time.`
`How could I dissect`
` the apple of Satoshi-kun's eyes?`
`I can feel scary images flashing in my head for the first time.`
`"Hee hee.`
` Don't worry.`
` Everything is already taken care of."`
`She smiled as if telling me that the dissection is already being prepared for too.`
`Is it just her who's smiling?`
`Am I smiling like her, too?`
`When I dissected that man last year,`
` I did feel guilt beforehand.`
`But once I started,`
` it was like I was in paradise.`
`All the pieces of the puzzle that were left by the late Dr. Takano fell into place, and at the same time, they didn't. How exciting it was.`
`Knowing that we are the first ones to take the first steps to solve a mystery, that is.`
`I don't even know how to explain this feeling to those who have never experienced it.`
` There's no way to describe it with words.`
`The only thing I can say is that even a year later, I still remember it vividly.`
`So if the results show that Satoshi-kun's beloved sister is to be dissected......`
` Can I control myself? Can I stay calm?`
`But... that means I'm a failure of a human being.`
`I know very well that the Houjou family was treated poorly by the villagers, and I know what Satoko-chan had to go through.`
`Also, I know Satoshi-kun loves his sister, who is his one and only blood relative.`
`How can I dissect Satoko-chan, using my research as an excuse?`
`I didn't feel much guilt for the man from last year, but I feel unbearable guilt towards Satoko-chan.`
`...That means what I did last year was very sinful.`
`I don't care if a stranger dies.`
`But I don't want Satoko-chan to die. That's not right.`
`All lives are equally precious.`
`I tried to convince myself that he was a violent murderer,`
` but maybe he only became that way because he was at the terminal stage.`
`I don't know anything about him before he became deranged.`
`Maybe he was a model citizen who was worthy of respect.`
`......Unfortunately, he became ill and ended up doing what he did. Maybe he was a victim himself.`
` Just like my father...`
`I know more about Hinamizawa Syndrome than anybody.`
`This disease makes people act in bizarre ways,`
` without those people realizing it.`
`So when the people at the terminal stage do such strange and violent things, one should be sympathetic.`
`I already knew that back when I decided to go down this path.`
`I should have remembered it sooner, but I only did just now.`
` I've finally realized what sinful research I'm working on.`
`Satoko Houjou's detailed test results came back.`
`The results say`
` L5.`
` She's at the terminal stage of the terminal stage.`
`It's actually a surprising result.`
`In last year's case, the patient was extremely deranged.`
`According to Takano-san's records, he complained about itching coming from the lymph nodes all over his body, and wanted to claw at his throat, just as the late Dr. Takano mentioned.`
`But Satoko-chan isn't displaying such symptoms.`
`Even in the late Takano's data, throat clawing is said to be a characteristic symptom of terminal stage patients. However, not all patients experience that symptom.`
`Besides, emotional expression is very different in each person.`
`Even if it's the same emotion, one patient may express it rather violently and another may express it calmly.`
`There's no way of knowing by just looking at a person.`
`But Satoko-chan's detailed test results says that she's at the terminal stage of the terminal stage, L5.`
`In other words, she may be feeling what the man from last year was feeling.`
` It's just that she isn't expressing that feeling in the same way the man was.`
`Hinamizawa Syndrome affects the frontal lobes of the brain. It stimulates the most primitive of emotions-"doubt"- very strongly.`
`As a result, terminal patients are trapped in delusions and paranoia, and end up committing horrible crimes.`
`Satoko-chan seems to show improvement when she's exchanging friendly words with Satoshi-kun.`
`But...... there's a paranoia stirring inside her that may put her in a deranged stage at any moment.`
`...I can't let her leave the clinic like this.`
`However, if things go according to the manual, I will have to make a decision on her dissection.`
`......My decision will only be a formality.`
`I can't actually refuse.`
`Takano-san appears to be already working on the dissection schedule.`
`That plan will then come to me.`
`Would I feel the same way`
` while dissecting Satoko-chan?`
`Would I be able to experience that trance once again?`
`...No, the question is, can I fight the temptation?`
`As I pretend to question myself, I'm letting Takano-san prepare things on her own. By doing so, am I passively agreeing to Satoko-chan's dissection?`
`If possible, I want to save Satoko-chan.`
` I don't want her to be a sacrifice for this research.`
` I don't want to dissect her.`
`Then, what about the man from last year?`
`Do I only care about the lives of the people I know?`
`If I don't dissect her, do I let her live and leave the clinic?`
`Do I simply wait for her to become deranged and commit a horrible crime?`
`And then she'll end up here, just like the man from last year,`
` and I'll end up dissecting her anyway.`
`The man from last year`
` was dissected alive`
` ...and kept that way for several months.`
`With his skull left open, he wasn't allowed to die for several months. He was kept alive, just for our cruel experiments.`
`I don't want to do that to her!`
`I don't know what to do.`
`Even debating and agonizing over it is leading toward consent to her dissection by elimination...`
