`"Sniffle...`
` Sniffle, sniffle...`
` Sniffle, sniffle..."`
`How long have I been crying?`
`I don't even know how long I've been comforted like this.`
`My grandfather's hand is on my cheek to comfort me.`
`I'm holding his hand lovingly and pressing my cheek against it.`
`"...Are you okay?"`
`"G... G... randpa...`
` Sniffle...`
` Waaaa... aaah..."`
`My grandfather put his other hand on my head.`
`The warmth of his palms gradually calmed me down.`
`Piles of documents were all around me.`
`It was a mistake to sort through data while lying on a fluffy carpet.`
`I must have fallen asleep,`
`and had a terrible dream.`
`"If you sleep facing down, the pressure on your chest makes it easier to have nightmares.`
` It's getting quite late.`
` Why don't you go to sleep, Miyoko?"`
`"I'm fine.`
` Ahaha, I took a nap, so I'm not sleepy anymore.`
` I'm almost done,`
` so I'm going to finish up, okay?"`
`"You have school tomorrow.`
` You should go to sleep, otherwise you'll get scolded for yawning again."`
`I've been going to bed late recently.`
`Because of that, I yawn a lot at school.`
` My teacher must have written a note to my grandfather.`
`"I'm fine.`
` I'll go to sleep as soon as I'm done.`
` So please let me finish, okay?`
` Besides, you shouldn't mind me!`
` Go back to your study and continue with your article!"`
`The day for him to present his findings is approaching.`
`He's been working so hard, devoting himself to his research, but there's unfortunately a limit to what an individual can do.`
`He needs a collaborator in order to go further with his research.`
`He has to explain that his investigation could be the key to solving the mysteries of human behavior, and make people understand just how important his work is.`
`But this research is about a very complicated subject,`
` so he couldn't seek assistance from just anyone.`
`Someone will be able to help him one day.`
`Believing that, my grandfather earnestly continued his research.`
`I want to help him more.`
`But all I can do is sort through his data and tidy up his materials.`
`I also assist him around the house so he can concentrate more on his research.`
`He always tells me how helpful I am, but that isn't enough for me.`
`I will study hard,`
` get into a good college,`
` and learn many things`
` so I can actually be of assistance to his research.`
`I'm a mediocre student right now, and I don't particularly like school,`
` but I will do it.`
` I want to help my grandfather.`
`If...`
` If his heart were to fail and he couldn't continue his research...`
`I wouldn't hesitate to cut open my chest and offer my heart up for him.`
`If he needs lungs, I'll give him my lungs.`
`If any of his organs fail, I'll give him mine.`
`...There's nothing strange about those feelings.`
`They're perfectly normal ones.`
`...For if he had found me even a day later...`
`I might not have been alive.`
`...Or even if I lived, it would either be without my body intact...`
` or with my mind lost to me.`
`In other words, I'm alive because my grandfather came to save me.`
`...If he hadn't rushed to find me, I wouldn't be here.`
`So I won't hesitate to give up my life for him.`
`Moreover, I'd be more than happy to do that.`
`Even though I want to be with him forever, human lives aren't immortal.`
`Just like how my parents died,`
` it happens`
` so suddenly`
` without any warning.`
`I will never heal from my parents' deaths.`
`But now that I have my grandfather,`
` I'm not sad.`
`However, his existence isn't eternal, either.`
`He may disappear all of a sudden for any unexpected reason.`
`Just like my parents...`
`That's why I wish to be part of him.`
`That way, no matter what happens, we will be together forever.`
`I don't want to be alone ever again.`
`I want to be with my grandfather forever.`
`I want to help him forever.`
`"...Okay.`
` Then be sure to go to sleep after you finish this, okay?`
` Promise?"`
`"Yep. I promise!"`
`We pinky promised, after that.`
`We smiled at each other, and my grandfather went back to his study.`
`The dried-up tears are making my cheeks itch.`
`I headed to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth.`
`I looked at my face in the mirror.`
`...None of my grandfather's features are recognizable on my face.`
`Of course they aren't.`
` We're not related.`
`He must have a family too, but I've never heard about them.`
`He doesn't seem to want to talk about that subject, so I don't ever ask him about it.`
`I don't care if he has real grandchildren or not.`
`Even if I'm not related to him,`
` I'm a granddaughter of Hifumi Takano.`
`I'm not just a granddaughter, either.`
`I want to be more than that.`
`I don't want a parent and child relationship, nor a lovers' relationship. Nothing like that.`
`...I want something more certain that binds our souls,`
` something that not even a tragedy can destroy.`
`I am Miyoko Takano.`
` Hifumi Takano's granddaughter.`
`...Maybe it should be 'Miyo' instead.`
`...That's what my grandfather sometimes calls me.`
`I want to succeed Hifumi's spirit.`
`Since his name counts from one to three... I want us to share that "three" and be the fourth in his line.`
`Today, my name changes.`
`I wrote that new name in the mirror.`
`Miyo Takano.`
`What a wonderful name for the new me.`
`"Colonel, sir!`
` Good to see you again!"`
`"Takano-kun!`
` Come on, no more Colonel stuff, no, no!`
` I was worried when I heard you were ill...`
` You sure look great now!"`
`"Waaaahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`My grandfather always told me he doesn't have any friends.`
` He used to tell me everyone died in the war.`
`But that's not true.`
`He has one very close friend.`
`This is him. He's an elderly man my grandfather calls Colonel Koizumi.`
`I don't know exactly where they met, but every time they get together, all they talk about is the military and the war.`
` So I guess that's where they met.`
`"Look at you, Miyo-chan!`
` How tall are you now?"`
`"Hmm...`
` we just had a physical checkup the other day`
` and`
` I think I've grown two centimeters!"`
`"That's wonderful!`
` Good girl!`
` Make sure you eat well, play a lot, and grow big and healthy!`
` I envy you, Takano-kun, for having such a cute granddaughter..."`
`Mr. Koizumi knows that my grandfather and I aren't related, but he always calls me his granddaughter.`
`That makes me very happy, so I poured a little more black tea in his cup.`
`After I finished serving tea, I left with a bow.`
`I want to stay and listen to them talk,`
` but I guess my grandfather doesn't want me to hear stories of the war, so he always makes me leave.`
`I left before I was told to.`
`But having to leave doesn't mean I need to go to a different room.`
`I just headed to the other side of this huge living room instead.`
`Although I'm not right by them, I can still sit on a sofa and listen to their conversation.`
`And if they need something, I can come help them right away.`
`...I try to earn points that way to prove I'm useful.`
`I sat on a sofa away from them and started reading an encyclopedia.`
`While doing that, I tried to listen to their conversation.`
`"That's great!`
` The professors said they want to come over on Sunday, the week after next!"`
`"Really?`
` Thank you very much, Koizumi-san!"`
`"Don't mention it!`
` This just means the report you wrote was that interesting, Takano-kun.`
` They're showing a lot of interest.`
` They even said it's possible that this research could receive the Nobel Prize."`
`"A Nobel Prize...?!`
` Hahaha, that sounds wonderful!"`
`My grandfather laughed.`
`Since he laughed so cheerfully,`
` something great must have happened.`
`...Mr. Koizumi must have shown the society the essay my grandfather was about to announce and gauged their reactions.`
`And supposedly, they found it extremely interesting.`
`That means they recognized the value of my grandfather's research.`
`That makes me happy, too.`
`"But what worries me is that you'll get infected with the syndrome yourself.`
` Make sure you don't end up clawing out your own throat, okay?"`
`"Well, maybe I'm already infected...`
` But Hinamizawa Syndrome is harmless if you live a normal life. `
`It was a dangerous disease back when the villagers believed in Oyashiro-sama and bound themselves with strict rules. `
`...But those have faded over time, and now people rarely show symptoms unless something major happens."`
`"After that many cases?"`
`"A patient's emotional state has a lot to do with how the syndrome develops.`
` As long as you live a normal life, there's nothing to worry about."`
`"So when one is under a lot of pressure, like during the war, the disease gets worse..."`
`"That's right.`
` Well...`
` There's nothing to worry about.`
` The subjective symptom of the initial stages is a paranoia akin to that in depression. `
`Once you notice it happening, you can teach yourself to relax emotionally and physically by using my breathing method, and you should also get at least nine hours of sleep a night over a one week period! `
`That's how you prevent it from worsening.`
` In fact, of all the Hinamizawan soldiers under my direction, not even one died mysteriously."`
`As he talks, grandfather started demonstrating the Takano Breathing Method and a bizarre exercise technique.`
`According to him, this technique relaxes the body and lets blood and lymphatic fluid flow smoothly. As a result, you relax emotionally, too.`
`But the movements involved in the technique are so weird... I had to look away because my grandfather looked so silly.`
`......That was the one thing about his research that I felt bad about.`
` Oh...`
`Grandfather asked me to do this exercise, too.`
`I don't want to make him sad so I do it when instructed.`
`"Hmm.`
` I'm glad to hear that.`
` Hideyo Noguchi died in the middle of his research.`
` So please be careful, okay?"`
`"However, Noguchi-sensei's great work is still acknowledged even after his death.`
` As a researcher, I'm sure that was his long term goal."`
`Grandfather tells me about Hideyo Noguchi often.`
`He was born as the son of a poor farmer, but he studied hard and became a doctor.`
`However, he was mistreated because of his background, so he left Japan.`
`He moved to the United States.`
`There he made many accomplishments as a researcher. He discovered a vaccine for yellow fever.`
`Grandfather's background is somewhat similar to his,`
` so he often said that of all researchers, he admired him the most.`
`Hideyo Noguchi died in North Africa.`
`While he discovered a vaccine for yellow fever...`
`He heard it wasn't effective on yellow fever in North Africa.`
` He went there to research it,`
` came down with the disease, and died.`
`A researcher losing his life for his research.`
`Sometimes that is a test of a researcher's courage.`
`In that sense, grandfather is very brave to visit Hinamizawa himself to gather information.`
`He himself says he may already be infected.`
`Although, my grandfather estimates from ancient texts that the Hinamizawa Syndrome was only a menace centuries ago,`
` and now it's no different from the usual bacteria that share a symbiosis with humans.`
`Many people became ill with the disease during the war, but that was because they were in an extremely abnormal situation.`
` In today's peaceful environment, it's almost impossible for a person to develop symptoms.`
`He sounds very optimistic, but he never brought me with him to Hinamizawa, so maybe he isn't as optimistic as all that.`
`However, since I live with him, there is a possibility that I'm already infected as well.`
`But I'm not worried at all.`
`That's because my grandfather has taught me that as long as I maintain myself physically and emotionally, I won't develop any symptoms.`
`I know all about the horrible terminal symptoms of Hinamizawa Syndrome, but I'm not overly fearful of them.`
`Grandfather is enjoying his conversation with Mr. Koizumi.`
`That's understandable.`
`Mr. Koizumi told him some people showed great interest in his report.`
`They even want to come over on Sunday, the week after next, to meet and talk to him directly.`
`With the rapid advance of modern medicine, unexplored frontiers are steadily dwindling.`
`...Was it possible the Hinamizawa Syndrome my grandfather discovered might be a new continent in the field?`
`It'll be decided in two weeks.`
`It sounds like there will be more than one person coming.`
`And it also sounds like they're all important people in the society.`
`They're all rich and famous, yet they aren't satisfied with just that. They all want to be involved with something that's worth an international award.`
`This is a chance to gain assistance and sponsorship at the same time.`
`"I'll see you in two weeks.`
` I'll make sure to be here.`
` Good luck!"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` I owe you everything..."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It's too early to say that. Let's wait until you find some sponsors.`
` When that time comes, let's have a toast with that treasured wine of yours!"`
`That was the last of their conversation.`
`My grandfather kept his head bowed until Mr. Koizumi was gone.`
`It sounded like he set up this great chance for my grandfather.`
`So I bowed my head just like him.`
`"Did you hear that?`
` Finally there's a chance for me.`
` There are people who are interested in my report."`
`"I know, I heard!`
` Now you'll have people to fund you and people to help with your research!"`
`"Well, that's not set in stone yet.`
` Hahaha."`
`Although he didn't want to admit it, he had a good feeling about it.`
`The research he had conducted all alone was finally about to gain recognition.`
`"Sunday, the week after next?"`
`"Quite!`
` I'll be busy.`
` Their first impression depends on my presentation!`
` I have to rearrange my data... no, I probably should practice explaining things in front of people. `
`Anyway, I have to make sure I don't forget anything!"`
`"Boy, it'll be a lot of work to rearrange your data.`
` Your handwriting is bad, so maybe you should write bigger."`
`"Mmm...`
` Anyway, I'll be busy!`
` The next two weeks will go by fast!"`
`"You're right!`
` I'll help you, too.`
` All the formalin jars have to be dusted.`
` Also, we'll need to straighten our rolled up documents. `
`Do you think leaving them laid out under the rug overnight would fix it?"`
`"Hmmm...`
` We have plenty of things to do!`
` Miyo, could you help me?"`
`"Of course!`
` I'll skip school for it!"`
`"No, you can't miss school!"`
`We laughed together, thrust our fists into the air, and motivated ourselves to work hard toward the week after next.`
`Since that day, my grandfather spent more time in his study.`
`It's not easy to create a report that you're going to show other people.`
`Copying machines hadn't been invented back then, `
`so everything had to be handwritten.`
`He knows it's somewhere, but he just can't remember where he put the data he needs.`
`As for me, I have to make sure I have enough guest cups to serve tea, so I'm counting them.`
`Do I have enough tea leaves?`
`Maybe I should get something to go with tea...`
`My grandfather knows nothing about these things.`
`There's a whole list of chores to do.`
`I need to clean the windows so the room will be bright... what else?`
`The two weeks pass quickly while we busy ourselves getting things done.`
`What a wonderful two weeks it is. I can finally feel that I'm actually doing something to help my grandfather with his research.`
`I hope the day of the meeting will be a memorable one for my grandfather.`
`I hope that day will be a beautiful and clear one.`
`Just as I wished, the day is beautiful.`
`Evening.`
`My grandfather, having dressed formally, paced around his study nervously.`
`I'm also in a beautiful dress. I've only worn it once before, at my piano recital.`
`But I'm not nervous like my grandfather.`
`His silly nervousness actually relaxes me.`
`Are they here yet?`
` Grandfather looked out the window.`
`Then a black car stopped in front of the gate.`
`Back then, a car was a luxury item.`
`I don't think I had even one classmate whose family owned a car.`
`So it only makes sense that the men coming out of the car look respectable.`
`Grandfather and I ran out to welcome them.`
`"Welcome.`
` I'm Takano.`
` Thank you for coming today..."`
`"May I take your jacket?"`
`I greeted them and filled the role we decided ahead of time.`
`Though my being relaxed by my grandfather's silliness ended at that point.`
`...Both my grandfather and I were stiff with anxiety as we greeted them now that the moment was here.`
`"Nice to meet you, doctor.`
` And hello, young lady.`
` Are you his granddaughter?"`
`"Yes.`
` Miyo, please say hello."`
`"Very nice to meet you.`
` I'm Miyo Takano."`
`"What a good girl.`
` I'm here in place of Koizumi-sensei.`
` Something came up and he can't make it today.`
` He's very sorry."`
`"I see.`
` I'm sorry to hear that."`
`The person who set up everything isn't here.`
`My grandfather even had his treasured wine ready, just as they promised two weeks ago.`
`"Everyone, let me introduce you...`
` This is Dr. Hifumi Takano.`
` Dr. Takano was a leading member of the Research Center for the Prevention of Epidemics in Manchuria during the war. `
`He made many advances in developing synthetic food and synthetic alcohol as measures against malnutrition and ration shortages."`
`"...Nice to meet you."`
`"Pleasure to meet you."`
`"Thank you for having me."`
`The men are even older than my grandfather. They take off their hats one at a time to greet him.`
`Their beards, expensive-looking canes, and glasses tell me they are very high up in the society.`
`Grandfather bows to each one of them.`
`"Everyone, please come into the study.`
` Ah, please excuse the mess.`
` Come in, come in...`
` Miyo, serve tea for everyone."`
`"Yes."`
`I wasn't nervous at all earlier.`
`But now, I think I'm the most nervous one.`
`I'm not the one making the presentation, and I'm not the one being evaluated, so it's ridiculous that I'm feeling so nervous.`
`I don't know if I should use that as my excuse...`
`...But I was so nervous that I knocked over the thermos I had filled to the brim with hot water, and ruined the black tea I'd chosen specifically for this day.`
`I apologized to my grandfather and started to boil water again.`
`I just need enough for the guests.`
`By the time I had cups of tea and cookies ready, grandfather's presentation was at its key part.`
`"It pierces the blood or lymph vessels and spreads to the spinal cord, and from there it travels along the cerebrospinal fluid to the brain.`
` I've confirmed many cases of encephalitis after autopsies. `
`Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is known to be caused by roundworm, and we predict its behavior to be extremely similar,"`
`Grandfather said, walking between samples in formalin jars and pointing to several as he gave his explanation.`
`There are over a hundred formalin jars in here with parts of brains in them.`
`They were all very dusty, so I spent a few days cleaning them.`
`I am rather proud to see the sparking jars all lined up like this.`
`"However, roundworms induce an extremely wide range of symptoms.`
` A headache, narcosis, derangement.`
` None of those are characteristic symptoms of roundworms. `
`On the other hand, symptoms of Hinamizawa Syndrome are very specific to that disease."`
`"You're saying one of them is to claw out one's own throat, yes?"`
`"Exactly.`
` Some soldiers witnessed it just before their fellows died.`
` Such self-mutilation was never seen before in any disease.`
` It only occurs in Hinamizawa Syndrome. `
`Also, since that symptom was only seen with terminal stage patients, I believe that's a means of exodus, something we've seen before in several parasites. `
`Parasites mature inside of an organism, reproduce, then leave the host and look for the next one."`
`"So what do you think about the fact that the cases were only seen in the soldiers from Hinamizawa,`
` even though other soldiers touched their blood, which must have been full of parasitic eggs or larva? `
`Don't you think there was a possibility of them getting infected?"`
`"I suspected things like an incubation period, but since it was limited to people from the Hinamizawa region,`
` I believe something such as the unique local climate must play a role. `
`I'll talk about that in the next part, but the ancient, indigenous beliefs of Hinamizawa have..."`
`"That can't be possible, Dr. Takano.`
` I've never heard of parasites behaving socially."`
`"Yes, well, that is one of the revolutionary discoveries in the Hinamizawa Syndrome..."`
`The elderly gentlemen mumbled to each other while pointing at the data.`
`With that, I finally realize things aren't going too well.`
`"Dr. Takano, I've been reviewing your data while listening to your gracious presentation.`
` First of all, it is simply impossible for parasites to control human minds. `
`Human thoughts are controlled by the brain, which is a work of art created by God. `
`Furthermore, ideology is an extremely advanced aspect of human thought. It's an advanced capability bestowed only to humans on this planet.`
` Yet you would say parasites intervene in that?!`
` Please, that's absurd."`
`"I agree.`
` Ideology can also be considered a manner of thought that prioritizes the whole over the individual.`
` In other words, that's the most important prerequisite condition for a society. `
`There's no way parasites would be gifted with that, when their only demand is to pass on their genes.`
` In the field of biology, there has never once been a discovery of sociality or eusociality within parasites."`
`"B-But, there are cases of parasites interfering with the host's behavior..."`
`"You're misunderstanding one thing, Dr. Takano.`
` The principle that drives parasites capable of controlling their host is always reproduction and propagation. It's only that primitive concept. `
`Even in the example you used before, of a rat infected with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> losing its aversion to cats, `
`the altered behavior is simply a means to let their host be eaten by a better host in order to change hosts."`
`"That's just like a grasshopper infected with a horsehair worm drowning itself.`
` Once a horsehair worm matures, it becomes aquatic. `
`When that happens, it guides a grasshopper to the water and drowns it, then enters the environment it's adapted for."`
`"...E-Exactly.`
` The suicidal act of clawing out one's throat corresponds to that in the case of Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
` For example, guinea worms escape the body by having the host scratch the affected area."`
`"Indeed.`
` The purpose of all these parasites is reproduction.`
` For them to infest the brain, God's masterpiece,`
` ...No, no, infecting the brain itself isn't that strange. `
`...But to say they infest it and influence human ideology is frankly delusional.`
` In fact, that's a dangerous idea."`
`"I don't think it's that strange that Hinamizawa, an isolated culture, developed its own unique faith.`
` There are actually many examples of that all over Japan.`
` So are you saying all of them were due to parasites? `
`Or that they were all due to cultural reasons, except the one in Hinamizawa, which was caused by parasites?`
` How do you establish the distinction?"`
`"W-Well,`
` as I said, in my autopsies on the Hinamizawan soldiers who died in the war,`
` there was sufficient evidence to believe..."`
`"Excuse me, Dr. Takano.`
` I don't think you've gathered enough case studies to call it clinical data.`
` Furthermore, as you said, it was during the war."`
`"No, I mean,`
` as I explain in the next part,`
` Hinamizawa Syndrome develops when one experiences suspicion, nervousness, and stress, and becomes emotionally unbalanced..."`
`"I think it's a unique approach to suspect some manner of commonality if there were several cases of unique and bizarre self-mutilation such as clawing one's throat out. `
`Yet, that's all the more reason it's unreliable.`
` Maybe it was just a coincidence that such rare cases happened under abnormal circumstances like the war. `
`I believe you witnessed the convergence of coincidences, and trapped in a gestaltist view, deluded yourself into finding a pattern."`
`"To prove otherwise, you would need an enormous amount of clinical data on Hinamizawa Syndrome patients.`
` But ethically, that's impossible to prove...!"`
`"The natives' act of recognizing it as a curse suggests it's more within the realm of culture-bound syndromes.`
` And you think that it is a delusional parasitic disease? `
`I hate to say this, but I think you admire the beliefs of the Hinamizawans a little too much,`
` and as a result, you yourself have been taken in by their culture-bound reactive syndrome. `
`Actually, that happens quite often with people who research more unusual fields of study.`
` We're trying to be careful ourselves."`
`""Ha ha ha ha ha ha...""`
`The more they talk, the paler my grandfather's face becomes.`
`I was just stunned, myself.`
`We've never heard of parasites like that. That's impossible.`
`It was just a coincidence and there isn't enough data.`
`The talk goes on and on and every time grandfather says something, they dismiss it like that.`
`...Before he knew it, my grandfather could only hold his silence before their criticisms.`
`"Well, no revolutionary discovery is accepted at first.`
` Maybe this research of yours is one of those things.`
` Even if it's ridiculed at first, it may achieve recognition in later years.`
` That happens all the time."`
`"I... I'm just an amateur.`
` I'm just a private researcher who didn't graduate from an elite college, nor do I belong to any academic clique.`
` I don't have any connections with experts or research centers. `
`That's why this is all I can do.`
` Is the Hinamizawa Syndrome real,`
` or is it just my delusion, just like you all say it is?`
` To find out, I need your help."`
`"Of course, if this was the discovery of the century, it would create a major uproar. `
`After all, you're suggesting that human culture and ideology is all the will of parasites, and our frontal lobe is a place for them to live. Hahaha, what an audacious theory."`
`"If a link between the existence of this Hinamizawa Syndrome and the disease carriers' belief in Oyashiro-sama could be established, `
`then it would be possible to explain all religions,`
` no, all cultural divisions on Earth."`
`"What a magnificent and unique idea.`
` Dr. Takano, instead of showing people like us your essays in secret, you should publish a book about it for the general public."`
`Grandfather looks at the ground, his fists trembling a little.`
`But... their words were far too cruel.`
`I don't know anything about academics. I'm just a little girl.`
`I don't know exactly what they're talking about, but...`
`Grandfather worked so hard by himself until today.`
`But to prove his research and delve further into it, he needs sponsors.`
`Yet those sponsors are casting him away, calling his research a delusion.`
`That's outrageous.`
`Like asking which came first, the chicken or the egg.`
`Besides, if his research was at the level those cheeky men want to see, he wouldn't need their help.`
`But they're saying that they can't help him unless they see some results that are beyond the level of private research.`
`In any field, doesn't research always start out with just a little idea?`
`If you can prove its existence beforehand, then what's the point of researching it to begin with?`
`If a wild idea can't be the subject of research, how did we gain any knowledge at all?`
`But never mind that...`
`When Mr. Koizumi came two weeks ago, didn't he say they were really interested in his research?`
`What's going on? This is the complete opposite of what he said!`
`"Yes.`
` I think this is very interesting research.`
` The human brain still holds many secrets."`
`"Dr. Takano's idea is an extremely unique one.`
` It seems impossible to ignore, especially from a eugenics perspective."`
`"Humans are not God's children.`
` We're simply animals who underwent the baptism of evolution.`
` As such, according to Darwin, there will be differences in that evolution based on environment. `
`In other words, humans can be either superior or inferior.`
` As a nation, we must think how we can maintain good bloodlines and how we can leave good genes behind. `
`...If we do not raise that as a national policy and research towards it, then by the next century, mankind may fall to a fatal position on the hierarchy."`
`"Dr. Takano's research has the potential of encompassing more than just parasitic diseases."`
`"If the evil, inferior humans we shouldn't let breed, `
`can actually be explained by a disease instead of genetics, then it becomes possible to correct their behavior through surgery. `
`As a result, we can leave wonderful people for our future.`
` From the eugenic point of view, Dr. Takano's research should get started immediately."`
`"It's possible this could be the greatest discovery since Moniz's invention of the lobotomy. `
`If causality between infectious diseases and an individual's nature could be established, this would be more than Nobel Prize-worthy."`
`"Koizumi-sensei, thank you for giving us this chance."`
`"Takano-kun is a single-minded and passionate man.`
` But he is not good at dealing with people.`
` He's been working on his research all by himself. `
`But now he's hit the limit of what one person can do, and he needs help.`
` Please, everyone, listen to what Takano-kun has to say."`
`"Oh, you don't even need to ask, Sensei!`
` We are the ones who should be thanking you for this opportunity."`
`"We're already willing to help him.`
` In fact, the more urgent matter will be arranging jurisdictions within society."`
`"I would like to thank you for giving me an opportunity to be involved`
` in such a unique research project at this age."`
`There was a knock on the door. The sliding door opened, and the owner peeked in.`
`"Excuse me.`
` There's someone asking for you. May I bring him?"`
`"Someone?`
` Who could it be?"`
`The owner whispered into Koizumi's ear, and his face turned pale all of a sudden.`
`"P-Please, let him in.`
` No, no, no, I'll come greet him with you...!"`
`As Koizumi stood up, two pairs of footsteps reached the door.`
`"S-Sensei!`
` I didn't expect you to be here..."`
`"Koizumi-kun, long time no see.`
` I have something I need to tell you today."`
`"Yes.`
` If you need to tell me something, I'm all ears!`
` Please go ahead!"`
`The old man known as Koizumi was not someone whose status could be taken lightly.`
`Although he had retired, he was still powerful enough to wield great influence as a fixer.`
`So from his meek attitude, it was easy to figure out what kind of person this man must be.`
`The old man held onto his bodyguard's shoulder as he walked. He had an expensive-looking cane in his other hand.`
`He couldn't even walk on his own because of his old age...`
` but his intense, commanding presence hadn't declined one bit.`
`"I'll get straight to the point.`
` Your friend's research...`
` you`
` need to put a stop to that."`
`"Huh...?`
` Wh-What do you mean...?"`
`"Koizumi-kun.`
` He must take his knowledge of Hinamizawa Syndrome to his grave.`
` Nobody should touch it.`
` If anyone looks into it...`
` Well, if you poke a bush, a snake will come out.`
` A big, fat snake too. `
`...It would pain me to just watch you get swallowed by it.`
` That's why I'm here to give you some advice.`
` Can your friends wait for a little?`
` So how about it? Do you want to have some drinks with me in a different room?"`
`"Y-Yes!`
` I'll come with you straightaway."`
`Koizumi realized that he was being pressured.`
`He didn't know which direction it was coming from, but clearly some authorities weren't comfortable with the research on Hinamizawa Syndrome, and were trying to stop him from supporting it.`
`"...Koizumi-kun, do you remember...`
` ...the Marco Polo Bridge Incident?"`
`"This is utter nonsense.`
` We came here today expecting to hear a more objective side.`
` Normally we wouldn't come all the way here for something like this, but since Koizumi-sensei asked us, we didn't have a choice."`
`"This really was a waste of time, but in a way, it was a good thing we came.`
` We were able to give you some advice.`
` ...You should take up bonsai instead of wasting the rest of your life on this.`
` Bonsai is great!"`
`"I agree!`
` It's not healthy to just stare at formalin jars in a study."`
`"But it sure is a unique subject.`
` If you want, I'll introduce you to the chief of a publishing company.`
` The general public loves things like this, you know."`
`They aren't even trying to hide their hostility.`
`They're laughing at my grandfather, denouncing him, and saying things to denigrate not only his research but his personality as well.`
`If they are simply trying to provoke him...`
`Any response would just be giving them what they want.`
`...Even in this very moment, Grandfather tried to remain a noble researcher... and a proud human being.`
`He's no longer trembling.`
`On the contrary, he apologized to them for taking up their time`
` and told them he had no intention of keeping them any longer.`
`"We'll give this article back to you.`
` Though it'd be so much easier if we could actually call it an article."`
`One of the elderly gentlemen tossed it back to him.`
`Grandfather couldn't catch it in time...`
` ...The article he worked so hard on fell onto the floor, and the papers scattered all over on the carpet.`
`The elderly gentleman left the study without even apologizing for it.`
`Everyone else followed suit.`
`As they left, they trod all over my grandfather's article.`
`It looked like Grandfather's expression didn't change.`
`...But I could see it warping.`
`I could see the wall of research Grandfather bore crunching and warping sadly.`
`"............!!"`
`I jumped.`
`I grabbed onto the elderly gentleman's leg.`
`I don't hate him.`
`If I were asked if I hated him or not, the answer would be yes... but that's not the point here.`
` What I really can't stand is this foot stepping all over my grandfather's article.`
`"Don't step on it!!`
` Don't step on it!!`
` Grandpa worked so hard on it. Don't step on it!!!"`
`I just want to move the foot that's standing on his papers.`
`But the foot doesn't move, no matter how hard I push or pull, as if it's rooted to the floor.`
`I felt someone grabbing me from behind.`
` It was my grandfather.`
`"Please excuse my granddaughter.`
` Don't worry about this.`
` We'll clean it up."`
`"Don't!!`
` Don't step on them!!!`
` I'm telling you not to step on my grandpa's article!!!"`
`My screams don't mean a thing to them.`
`They completely ignored`
` my screams.`
` They continued to step on the papers`
` and left the study.`
`Only my grandfather and I remain in there now.`
`My grandfather is still grabbing the back of my collar.`
`I don't have any words left to say. Only cries.`
`My grandfather is determined not to show any emotion.`
` He doesn't even open his mouth.`
`So I have to cry for him.`
`Just then, my grandfather slapped me in the face.`
`That startled me. I'm crying for him, so why did he slap me?`
`Then I understand.`
`Grandfather is the one who wants to cry.`
`But he's enduring.`
`So I shouldn't cry either.`
`I wiped my eyes and my runny nose. Then I silently turned my eyes to the papers on the carpet, just like my grandfather.`
`"...`
`...`
`...`
` Sorry,`
` Miyo."`
`I don't understand why he's apologizing.`
`I thought he was going to complain about their rudeness.`
`"If I had worked harder,`
` this wouldn't have happened.`
` Until today,`
` you helped me so much`
` and it was all for nothing... Sorry about that..."`
`How courageous he is.`
`Even after that disaster, he's still concerned about me.`
`I shook my head and put my hands on the floor...`
`I tried to gather up the papers,`
` but then... they began to fall.`
` My tears are overflowing again, blurring the ink on the papers.`
`...These are... all handwritten by Grandfather.`
`He was so happy that finally there was someone who understood his research.`
` He was so happy.`
` He spent all night writing these.`
`But they stepped on them.`
`They might as well have stepped on my grandfather's very soul.`
`"I didn't work hard enough...`
` If I had done more, this wouldn't have happened.`
` Sorry...`
` I'm so sorry.`
` I'll work even harder.`
` I won't give up`
` because of something like this!"`
`I don't know if he's saying that to me or to himself.`
`"Don't worry.`
` God is watching.`
` I have to believe that I'll gain recognition.`
` That day will come.`
` That's why I have to keep working harder."`
`Grandfather says that all the time.`
`...But I know the truth.`
`God only plays with people's fate. He doesn't save anyone out of goodwill.`
`That's why he let this happen to my grandfather, even though he's worked so hard and so humbly until today...`
` That's why he let such a horrible thing happen to me when I was still an innocent little girl.`
`...Grandfather keeps repeating himself.`
` ...But I know the truth.`
`God exists.`
`The existence Grandfather believes in is real.`
`But there's no mercy to be found in God.`
`He delivers unreasonable fates and makes us call it a challenge.`
`I can't tell my grandfather that, of course.`
`I ask God once more, like I did on the day of the thunderstorm.`
`...Why?`
`...Why can't you give my Grandfather's effort and hard work the recognition it deserves...?!`
`Grandfather told me that he'll gather up the papers, so I should put away the teacups.`
`I nodded silently and put the teacups that hadn't even been touched onto the serving cart.`
`As I pushed it out of the study,`
`Grandfather told me.`
`He told me to close the door after I leave.`
`I always close the door when I leave.`
`He doesn't need to remind me.`
`But that's what he wants, so without saying anything, I closed the door.`
`Then, as I walked away from the study...`
`I heard my grandfather sobbing.`
`Tears filled my eyes once more.`
`Sadness and disappointment... I almost feel angry with myself for not being able to do anything for him.`
`Then I felt a cool breeze on my wet cheeks.`
`The breeze was blowing in from a cracked-open window.`
` The curtain was flapping gently in that breeze.`
`I heard the cry of the higurashi.`
`As I listened to them, I calmed down gradually.`
`If`
` I can ease Grandfather's pain by crying, I'll cry in his place.`
`But that won't help.`
`On the contrary, he started to cry because I did.`
`I'm being useless here.`
`......I remember that day.`
`I remember the reason why I'm alive now.`
`If he hadn't come and saved me,`
` I would have spent the last days of my life lying in the corner of the bathroom as a human-shaped piece of meat.`
`Grandfather saved me.`
`He gave me back my rights.`
`The right to walk.`
` The right to stand up.`
` The right to wear clothes,`
` the right to eat,`
` the right to speak,`
` and the right to think.`
`In other words, the right to live as a human being.`
`Grandfather took action right after he got the phone call from me.`
`He found my house`
` and he found out which orphanage I was sent to`
` after struggling through the sloppily-filed records of the public office.`
` Then he saved me.`
`Of course, he was working on his research then.`
`He spent his precious research time on saving me, a perfect stranger.`
`I vowed that if his heart failed, I'd rip my heart out and give it to him.`
`But of course, his heart is fine.`
`So he doesn't need a heart. He needs something else that's equally important.`
`That's something only I can give him in this whole world.`
`I clenched my fists.`
`And held them so tightly`
` that my nails left marks.`
`I now know what I'm supposed to do with this new life as Miyo Takano.`
`I finally know.`
` I know the reason why the "new me" was born.`
`I know the purpose of Miyo Takano.`
`I thought I knew of my grandfather's greatness, but I actually didn't know the half of it.`
`For me to be able to really help him, I have to reach his level.`
`All my lessons lead back to my grandfather. There wasn't a single subject I could ignore.`
`Right now, studying hard is what I can do for him.`
`"I've been a teacher for a long time, but I've never seen such a hard-working student.`
` You've learned not only academically, but socially as well. You've made a great deal of friends."`
`"I have a goal which I can only reach by studying hard.`
` Also, I know how powerless an isolated genius is. That's why I needed to learn to socialize."`
`That's not enough.`
`"I'm not even close to where I want to be.`
` Entering college is only a step forward.`
` What matters is what I learn there."`
`I'm not even close.`
`I'm not even close to being able to help my grandfather.`
`"...Hmm.`
` I'm so proud of you.`
` You can go to Tokyo or Ochanomizu University, or any college of your choice.`
` Nothing will stop you. `
`The most important thing for you is that the school will teach you what you want to learn."`
`Do I have what I need to be able to truly understand Hinamizawa Syndrome and help Grandfather in his research?`
`I don't need compromises or excuses.`
`The heights I seek are lofty and precipitous.`
`This isn't enough, not even close.`
`My classmates are such idiots, acting as if they're winners in life just because they entered this school.`
`A college is simply a place to learn what I need to know.`
`If this self-proclaimed best school isn't worth my time, I'm not interested.`
`"I didn't expect a talented woman like you to end up at this parasite research center.`
` I'm sure everyone wanted you, huh?`
` I assumed you were interested in something bigger."`
`"I want to study and research parasites.`
` I've worked hard to earn the right to study here. Aren't I qualified to learn?"`
`"Yes, yes, of course!`
` There's no reason why we would refuse someone who got the top score on the entrance exam.`
` Welcome to the parasite research center.`
` People usually aren't that interested in our field. `
`There aren't too many researchers who study it.`
` That's why there's still a lot of unknown elements, compared to other fields."`
`That's quite true.`
` The study of parasites is a mysterious world.`
` Or rather, it's an ignorant one.`
`An ignorant world where the preconception that parasites can't possibly control humans pervades.`
`And those ignorant people laughed at Grandfather and stepped all over his article.`
`"There are still many unsolved mysteries in the world of parasites.`
` I'm here to solve them.`
` I came here to help the people who want to solve them."`
`Learning isn't enough for me.`
`I have to be able to research with my grandfather.`
`And so, I don't ignore the means to gain the help my grandfather couldn't get.`
`Grandfather's research isn't complete just when it's finished being written on a desk.`
`I need the help of plenty of people to present it to the world, so his great work will be praised by many.`
`"Yes, that's correct.`
` This is an association only the top graduates of the Imperial University are allowed to join. `
`Therefore, as only seven people per year are allowed to join, it's a small group compared to a normal organization of alumni. However, its solidarity is unrivaled."`
`"Thank you for inviting me to such a gathering, I'm honored.`
` I would like to take the lowest seat."`
`"Oh no, we can't let someone with such accomplishments and experience sit in the lowest seat.`
` I'm sure everyone will welcome you. `
`The cabinet minister and several important government officials, company presidents, and company advisors will be here.`
` They'll all need you, and they'll provide the help you need."`
`"...Koizumi-sensei belongs to this association, right?`
` He was my grandfather's best friend.`
` What a coincidence."`
`"I see.`
` I'm sure Koizumi-sensei will be glad to find out that you'll be joining."`
`An isolated genius is a useless one.`
`People live in society.`
`Society is made up of connections between people.`
`Nobody can ignore that.`
`I do my best as an individual,`
`but to gain the power that can't be achieved as a mere individual, I have to rely on my connections in society.`
`It's all for one purpose.`
`My only wish as Miyo Takano.`
`Yes.`
` I can't spare any effort.`
`My certain conviction will forge a certain future.`
`Nobody can interfere. Nobody can stop me.`
`I won't allow the die to roll a one.`
`I won't admit that diligent efforts can be erased by a mere train accident.`
`I'm going to make all the dice roll sixes.`
`I won't entrust the die to God. I won't give in to luck.`
`The only people who pray to God are people who don't want to work hard.`
`I don't trust God. I'm going to create results myself.`
`My strong will is going to create a certain future that God can't possibly prevent.`
`This is a different way to become a god than the one my grandfather taught me.`
`This is a way to become a god while still alive.`
`When I realized it, I became truly free.`
`Free from the sadness of losing my parents and my miserable life after that.`
`Free from grandfather's tears when his article was stepped on.`
`That's right. I'll be above God. I'll be an existence that God's caprices can't even touch.`
`I'll make people recognize Grandfather's research.`
`That's the future I wish for. The future I promised will come to pass.`
`People will fight over Grandfather's article.`
`People will respectfully read the same article that was once ridiculed and stepped on.`
`Even if Grandfather dies before that day comes.`
`I won't cry over something like that.`
`Because he already taught me.`
`Even after being buried, one can be resurrected.`
`I'm going to complete his great work, and the whole world will praise him.`
`Grandfather will resurrect, and become a god. He will be eternal.`
`That's an everlasting bond. A bond not even a train accident can break.`
`A bond not even a die that rolls a one can disturb.`
`Since the day of the train accident, my die has kept rolling ones over and over.`
`But I didn't give up. I kept working hard until today.`
`I'll rise above the die.`
`I'll decide what to roll on it.`
`I'll decide my own fate.`
`I'll do that with my unshakable willpower.`
`"When does the clinic open?`
` Is there going to be air conditioning?"`
`"I heard it'll open next month.`
` I hope there'll be a young doctor there. Hya hya hya!"`
`I heard some old ladies talking amongst themselves when I was going up the stairs to the shrine.`
`The Irie Clinic is already completed, and it's waiting and ready for opening day.`
`The state-of-the-art equipment has been delivered, and the research is waiting to begin as well.`
`Irie, too, is standing by in top form, and he's almost as passionate as I am about Hinamizawa Syndrome. `
`The Mountain Dogs, the counterintelligence unit to support and protect our research, are already stationed at a dummy company somewhere near Okinomiya.`
`They are getting in touch with various public institutions.`
`Everything is going well.`
`The only thing to worry about would be the rumors about the Hinamizawa Dam construction plans.`
`There's a rumor that the Ministry of Construction is pushing through a dam project that will submerge all of Hinamizawa, but they're under pressure from several groups.`
`None of my contacts have much influence in the Ministry of Construction, so things aren't going well.`
`Even if applying pressure doesn't work, there are other measures, so either way it'll come to a deadlock.`
`I'm not being optimistic.`
` I just know that's how it'll end.`
`"I will conduct research here in Hinamizawa."`
`I'm going to accomplish that with my absolute will.`
`That's why, even if God rolls a one on the die and says that he's going to submerge Hinamizawa, I will not be afraid.`
`I won't entrust my die to God.`
`I'm the one who's going to pick up the die, and I'm going to roll a six.`
`I didn't come to this shrine to declare war on the god of this place.`
`I came because I know that you can get a great view from up here.`
`I walked by the shrine and headed to the spot I found last time I visited.`
`It's the perfect spot for overlooking the entire village.`
`The strong wind reminds me that I'm only at the starting line`
` and that there will be a headwind before I reach my goal.`
`I looked over the village without faltering in the wind.`
`Grandfather approached the syndrome from a medical point of view, but he also approached it from a folkloric one as well.`
`The strange belief system in this village is proof that the existence of Hinamizawa Syndrome was already known of even in ancient times.`
` So it'll be extremely useful to research their history too.`
`My grandfather hadn't been doing research for hundreds of years, of course.`
`But this place has been here for hundreds of years, and they've been living with Hinamizawa Syndrome for that long.`
`Therefore, the beliefs created in this place and the legend itself can be considered the foremost researchers.`
`It's simply stupid to just call them old folktales or nonsense.`
`I've been researching them slowly... but they are indeed very interesting. No wonder Grandfather was intrigued by them.`
`Hinamizawa Syndrome has many fascinating sides to it.`
`It's just a like a kaleidoscope, showing infinite light with ever a slight change in angle.`
`It's so much fun to trace Grandfather's research.`
`Finding the same results as my Grandfather reminds me that I am indeed following in his footsteps, which makes me very happy.`
`This shrine is dedicated to Oyashiro-sama, the guardian deity of the village.`
`But this god the villagers worship is simply a delusion that was created by the parasites.`
`When I solve their secret and announce it to the world,`
` the god of this place will be no more.`
`That's the moment I will take revenge on the one who put me through misery and tested my fate.`
`That's it, isn't it?`
` This isn't just about making my grandfather's dreams come true.`
` It's also about getting revenge for my miserable life.`
`I went back to the front of the shrine.`
`There's an offertory box there, and I'm tempted to throw in some coins.`
`But you normally offer coins to ask for mercy.`
`I don't entrust my fate to God, so I don't need to give an offering.`
`I'm going to unmask him.`
`But until then, Oyashiro-sama is a god.`
`Okay, in that case, I'll show respect for now.`
` Hee hee hee.`
`As a declaration of war, I pulled out a ten yen coin from my wallet.`
`The ten yen coin I found in the telephone booth changed my life.`
`If it hadn't been there, my life would have ended then.`
`"I'm grateful at least for that ten yen coin."`
`I'm not grateful to the god of this shrine, though.`
`"But...`
` I haven't forgiven you yet.`
` I never expected anything from you, and I am here because of my own hard work.`
` Even if you keep playing tricks of fate, or keep rolling a one on the die...`
` That won't bother me. `
`With my certain will, I'm going to get what I want."`
`My grandfather will be praised... and become a god because of the research I'll do in this place.`
`I will defeat the god of this village, and become an existence above even gods.`
`"...Since when did I care about God, huh?`
` Maybe because my grandfather often talked about him?`
` ......Hee hee hee hee."`
`Here, this is the ten yen coin you gave me before.`
` ...My debt's paid off now.`
`You just keep clinging to your throne and tormenting people with your trials.`
`While I fight my battles to knock you down from there.`
`And so, I chucked the ten yen I once borrowed from God into the offertory box...`
`"...............Eh?"`
`For a moment, I couldn't understand what happened.`
`The ten yen coin was supposed to fall into the offering box.`
`But...`
` how can I explain this,`
` that's not what happened.`
`I aimed correctly, for certain.`
`Who could miss an offertory box anyway?`
`That's not it.`
`Because the ten yen coin`
` stopped in mid air`
` as if it got stuck in a spider web.`
`Then it bounced back to me and fell by my feet.`
`It was as though the offertory box had refused the coin.`
`...Of course.`
` An offertory box is to respect God.`
`But what I did`
` was challenge him.`
`That means...`
` this is...`
`I jumped.`
` Because I thought I was the only one here.`
`Anyone would jump when finding there's someone else standing there unexpectedly.`
`How long has she been there?`
`It's like she came out from the shrine.`
`A mysterious girl is standing on the other side of the offering box.`
`She's wearing a shrine maiden uniform, so she must be one of the caretakers here.`
`That's what I thought, too...`
` ...But there's something else about her.`
`She's not just one of the shrine caretakers.`
` She is the shrine itself...`
`Because`
` the girl is staring into my eyes...`
` no, she's glaring.`
`I smiled back fearlessly.`
`I think she heard my words of challenge to God.`
` She's wearing that expression on her face because of that.`
`The words came out naturally.`
`"You are...`
` the god of this place, aren't you?"`
`The girl didn't nod.`
` But I took that as a yes.`
`What a contradictory feeling.`
`...I'm rejecting the god of this land, denying its very existence... `
`Yet I don't doubt this girl is that god.`
`The girl opened her mouth to speak.`
`"...A strong will reinforces fate."`
`".........That's right."`
`That's what I say to myself often.`
`I've never said that to anyone or quoted it from anything.`
`So, under normal circumstances, I should be surprised to hear this girl say that.`
`But this girl isn't human, so I'm not surprised.`
`I replied to her.`
`"God throws the die of fate and has fun with people, depending on what he gets.`
` But people have willpower.`
` The stronger the willpower, the less chance of being bound by the result of the die.`
` You see? `
`People can gain a power that's strong enough to fight fate, by working to their limits."`
`"Yes.`
` I understand that very well.`
` An unshakable conviction defeats the die of fate."`
`"That's right.`
` That is mankind's revenge against the gods who toy with them by dice roll.`
` ...The hymn of those who would slough the gods' interference and forge their own destiny. `
`Know my divinity, and that I earned this day through effort after enduring all misfortune."`
`Hee hee hee hee...!`
`Spiteful laughter flowed out of my mouth.`
`But the girl's face displayed a strong will of her own. Her expression didn't even change a bit.`
`"......I understand very well.`
` No matter how many times we repeat, our fate doesn't change...`
` That was all because of your strong willpower."`
`"That's right.`
` 'A strong will reinforces fate'.`
` That fate, so empowered, isn't bothered by the result of a die.`
` That means it's a certain future."`
`"...You, a human, found that truth before us gods, who have been living for hundreds of years.`
` ...I admit it.`
` ...Your existence is close to that of a god."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Hee hee......"`
`The girl glared at me with her eyes half shut.`
` No, it was more like she was proclaiming something to me, while displaying her own strong willpower.`
`"......I... won't be defeated this time.`
` We always thought we couldn't win against you.`
` That was why I surrendered.`
` I abandoned hope and crawled around in the wheel of life.`
` But then I learned. `
`...The power of belief can cause a miracle that forges your destiny."`
`"Are you saying you'll cause a miracle, using your strong will that will defeat the destiny woven by mine...?`
` Hee hee, that's logical enough."`
`Because that's the law of this world.`
`A strong will can make a desired future possible.`
`"We...`
` won't be defeated by your will."`
`"That's fine. So you insist on being an old god.`
` Try it and see if your willpower can defeat mine.`
` God tests people, yet people aren't allowed to test God.`
` So I'm going to test you here.`
`See if your willpower can defeat mine. Come on, go ahead, try it...!!"`
`That's clearly a declaration of war from me to God.`
`This is the beginning of my revenge towards God, who put me through so much misery.`
`And this girl, this god, is accepting my challenge directly.`
`"I'm not as powerful as you are.`
` I can't do as many things as you can.`
` Even if my willpower is as strong as yours, you're still more powerful than I am."`
`"That's right. I've gained an overwhelming power.`
` You have absolutely no idea what I had to go through to gain it.`
` You can't even touch me. Hee hee...!"`
`"I know.`
` I know how powerful you are.`
` Compared to yours, the power my friends and I command is insignificant.`
` But I can choose not to give up. `
`I won't admit my loss. I won't give up until the day when your die rolls one and my die rolls six.`
` I'll prove the strength of my willpower by not surrendering to you for eternity. `
`Stacking up stones on the riverbed will allow us to cross the river and appear before you as an equal...!`
` And that's when this long battle of fate will come to an end."`
`"Heeheeheeahahahahahaha!`
` Fine, come on then!!`
` We'll see who has the stronger will!`
` Whoever has the stronger conviction will create the future.`
` The future desired by the stronger conviction will come to pass. `
`I will hold my ground!`
` In my future, my grandfather's great work is praised, and he becomes a god. And I take revenge on God for testing me by making me go through such misery."`
`Hee hee hee, ahhhahahahahahahaha ha ha ha!!`
` Stupid little god!`
` I'll show you!`
`"I'll drag you down from your pedestal!!`
`Bring it on!!"`
