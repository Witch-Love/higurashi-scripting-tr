`This game piece reminds us that no matter what happens on this game board, everything is due to the curse or the Sonozaki family pulling someone's strings.`
`No, to put it in my words, this is the piece that makes everyone aware of the existence of Rule Z.`
`It's hard to notice with just this piece.`
` But this is a complicated Fragment where Shion Sonozaki, while trapped in Rule X and mistaking it for Rule Y is hurled about,`
` comes to notice the existence of Rule Z.`
`But this is also the piece that teaches us the rules of the game board.`
`By the way, the piece called Shion Sonozaki is a piece coming from the outside, from the game's point of view.`
`She dislikes Satoko Houjou at first, but through this and another piece, she learns something important,`
` challenges Rule X, and then grows to be a powerful piece to fight Rule Z.`
`The most ridiculous part of this Fragment... is that it's hidden so cunningly, and doesn't seem that way at all with just a passing glance.`
`Learn, learn from your mistakes.`
`Please become a powerful piece and lend me your strength to defeat my enemies.`
