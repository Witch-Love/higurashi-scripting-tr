`School is the children's world.`
`The values of grownups don't apply.`
`Children decide their own values and create their own world.`
`So the rules of the grown-up world, of the village, don't mean anything here.`
`Even when the villagers badmouth the Houjou family and try to isolate them... that has no meaning at our school.`
`In the children's world, children decide the rules.`
`Rules they think are irrational don't exist here.`
`That's why,`
` as the representative for the children here, I vow that I will never let any irrational rules come into our world.`
`Within the school, no harassment is allowed towards the Houjou siblings.`
`In the very beginning, some boys teased Satoko, `
`but they were punished severely, and it hasn't happened ever since.`
`That's the least I can do to resist the madness of the village.`
`So I hope Satoshi and Satoko both feel that the school is a safe place for them.`
`Satoshi must notice my concern, because he often smiles when he's here.`
`However, I never see Satoko smile...`
`...Satoko's classmates used to try to cheer her up, but soon after, they decided that it was best to just leave her alone.`
`I used to try to talk to her...`
` but when I realized something, I stopped doing that.`
`I'm a member of the Sonozaki family.`
`To Satoko, I'm one of her enemies, so I'm sure she feels uncomfortable to have me around her.`
`All I can do is to watch over her.`
`That's why Satoko is alone in the classroom.`
`That said, Rika-chan is always hanging around with her, even though Satoko told her she was annoying. Satoshi, too, is always beside her.`
`These two are the only ones who remain by her side.`
`It isn't limited to Satoko, of course.`
` ...The malicious isolation is still continuing towards the Houjou family.`
`Because their hysterical aunt is so hostile towards her neighbors, there's nobody who sympathizes with her.`
`...It's wise to know there are fights worth picking and also fights better set aside.`
`If the aunt had even a little tolerance or self control, this isolation wouldn't have continued.`
`Of course, the villagers were the ones who forced them into that role, even though they weren't related to the issue.`
`But if she had stayed quiet, then it wouldn't have gone so far.`
`The aunt's hostility is one thing, but she's dragging everyone in the family into it as well.`
`The uncle and the aunt haven't been getting along, and he hardly comes home.`
`Both Satoshi and Satoko are forced to live in shame.`
`The aunt vents her stress by harassing Satoko.`
`...This was the same too.`
`The aunt is her guardian, after all, but Satoko doesn't even try to hide her disgust, so things aren't going smoothly between them.`
`If she had behaved like Satoshi, then she wouldn't have been made into a target.`
`So does that mean the sad life Satoko is living right now is something she caused herself?`
`...No, it doesn't.`
`But no matter how much I sympathize and how much I want to help her, `
`nobody knows what to do.`
`An apology won't change the situation.`
`The flow can't be reversed.`
`The fact that the Houjou family is ostracized by the entire village can't be changed.`
`That's the horribleness lurking underneath our lives.`
`...The neighbors,`
` the village, `
`and the community.`
`Once they become your enemies, the world can become so cruel.`
`...Japanese people have known that since ancient times, which is why we cultivated empathy and an obligation to show courtesy to one's neighbors.`
`No matter who I blame, Satoko won't smile.`
`So the only thing I can do is to watch over her and make sure that she's safe when she's at school.`
`"...Thank you,`
` Mion."`
`"...Eh?`
` Ahahaha, sorry, what?"`
`"Mmph.`
` I just want to thank you for being so concerned about Satoko."`
`Satoshi kind of appears absent-minded, but sometimes he says things as if he can read your thoughts.`
`I tried to deny it since it's out of character for me, but he smiled as if he could tell exactly what I was thinking.`
`"Satoko's just forgotten how to smile.`
` ...When she's at school... she can let go of a little tension for a while.`
` I'm sure she treasures that time."`
`"Ahahahahaha...`
` That's basically the only thing this ol' man can do for her..."`
`"...That's not true.`
` I really appreciate it."`
`"Stop that.`
` ...You don't need to say that.`
` Besides, my family is the one who's causing all this grief."`
`"...I don't think that way.`
` I really don't."`
`...I'm not good at reading people's subtle cues, but I know for sure what he just said is a lie.`
`Satoshi knows that he and his family are being isolated because of the Sonozakis,`
` and he's, of course, aware that I am a member of the Sonozaki family too.`
`Satoshi is mature, and that's the only reason he doesn't take it out on me.`
`If he had the same temper as his aunt, he would hate me bitterly.`
`Knowing that, the least I can do is not get close to them.`
`....But I'm a meddlesome person, and when I see Satoko looking depressed or Satoshi forcing himself to smile, I have to do something.`
`...That might be even more troublesome to Satoshi and Satoko though.`
`"............Maybe...`
` I just don't understand Satoko's feelings."`
`"...Why?"`
`"My family is causing Satoko grief.`
` So for me, a member of that family, to hang around her...`
` Is that the right thing to do?"`
`"Sure.`
` That's you being you."`
`"What do you mean by that?`
` Are you saying I'm insensitive?"`
`"Hmm... I don't mean that.`
` ...If this atmosphere itself is robbing Satoko of her smile...`
` then only someone who can completely ignore it can bring her smile back."`
`"...Th-This ol' man can't tell if you're trying to compliment him or not.`
` You're mean, ahahaha!"`
`"I'm not ridiculing you, really.`
` I just want you to help."`
`"...Eh?"`
`"...I can't make Satoko smile again by myself.`
` I need someone like you to help me."`
`"B-But...`
` I'm... Mion Sonozaki, you know?`
` If I do something insensitive, I might end up hurting Satoko even more..."`
`"Satoko is already lonely...`
` Are you going to leave her alone too?"`
`"........."`
`This is the first time Satoshi has asked me for something so aggressively.`
`Satoko is a very important person to him.`
`He's saying he needs my help to make her smile again.`
`But still...`
` No...`
` Maybe he's right.`
`What's going on between the Sonozaki family and the Houjou family is an issue among the grownups.`
` We children don't need to care about that.`
`The irrational rules of the grownups don't mean anything in our world.`
`...So I have to object to the irrationality of the grownup world using methods of my own.`
`"...Are you sure Satoko won't feel bothered by me?"`
`"She may, at first.`
` But I'll be with you.`
` I'll be with you, Mion.`
` So she'll open up right away."`
`"Y-You think so...?!`
` ......Should we do something after school today?"`
`"If we go home first, our aunt might say something, and we might not be able to leave."`
`"Okay, then it's simple.`
` Don't go home first."`
`"But if we get home too late, she'll ask us what we were doing..."`
`"Hmmm... let's see... I know!`
` Why don't you join a club?"`
`"A club?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Tell her you are going to an after-school club. Tell her that you're doing something after school before going home.`
` There are plenty of people who go out after school before they go home. `
`That'll be no problem!!"`
`"Ah, but... if we mess up our clothes, our aunt will say..."`
`"Okay, then we'll do something indoors!`
` Then your clothes will stay clean."`
`"Indoors? Do you mean in the classroom?`
` But wouldn't Chie-sensei say something?"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` It's possible to play passionately while not going wild indoors.`
` Contrary to my appearance, I love playing games!`
` I've collected some treasures from overseas too. `
`Some of the manuals are written in English and are a little complicated, while with some of them I need someone to play with, so a lot of them are just sitting in the storage room."`
`"Do you think Satoko can play those too?"`
`"Sure!!`
` Ahaha, if you don't know the rules, then you just make them up!`
` As long as everyone is following the same rules, it's totally okay!"`
`I said it so confidently, but would bringing games from home and asking Satoko to play with us actually make her smile again?`
`...What have I got to lose?`
` ...Maybe I'll bring one of the board games tomorrow.`
`"Oh... also, Mion.`
` I have something else I want to ask you."`
`"What?`
` This ol' man is all ears!"`
`"I`
` am looking for a part-time job.`
` I thought if I could get her a nice birthday present, that might make her feel better."`
