`The village was in an uproar.`
`Because the fourth mysterious death in a row, which everyone believed would happen, actually did.`
`Satoko-chan's aunt was killed.`
`All the villagers feel rather satisfied about this incident, saying the curse finally fell on her for being a local troublemaker.`
`But I know the truth.`
`When I saw the beaten up body at the crime scene,`
` I knew Satoshi-kun was responsible for it.`
`Her abuse towards Satoko-chan was getting worse and worse.`
`Satoshi-kun wanted to protect her.`
`So he brought home a baseball bat.`
`All the signs were there.`
` So I didn't even need to hear it from Satoshi-kun.`
`...Yet I couldn't avoid questioning myself.`
`I felt bad for the Houjou siblings, who had no one on their side, so I tried to be their ally.`
`...In the end, I failed to be any help to them...`
`The phone rang. It was Satoshi-kun.`
`He's never called me before.`
`What happened?`
`Does he want me to help him?`
`If so, I will.`
` I truly feel that way.`
`"Hello, Coach?`
` Sorry to bother you while you're at work."`
`"Oh, don't worry.`
` What can I do for you?"`
`"Umm... I can't think of anyone else who has a car..."`
`"A car?`
` Sure, I have one."`
`"I'm in front of a toy store in Okinomiya.`
` Not the one owned by Mion's uncle, but the other one by the dentist's office."`
`"Sure, I know where it is."`
`"I found a teddy bear for Satoko's birthday...`
` but...`
` mmph.`
` It's too big to put on my bicycle."`
`"Too big?`
` Ah ha ha ha, Satoshi-kun, how big is this teddy bear?"`
`"......Mmph."`
`I guess he didn't think about it and went to the toy store on his bicycle. Now he's stuck.`
`That's so typical of him. I can't help but smile warmly.`
`In other words, he can't carry both the bicycle and the teddy bear, so he wants me to come pick him up.`
`I told him I'd be right over, and headed to the toy store in Okinomiya.`
` When I got there, I found that the teddy bear he bought`
` is a lot bigger than I imagined.`
`"Oh my...!`
` Ha ha ha, this is huge!`
` There's no way you can put this on your bicycle, huh?"`
`The teddy bear is so big that Satoshi-kun can hardly wrap his arms around it.`
`If he puts it on his lap in the passenger seat, he won't be able to see anything.`
`We loaded the bicycle in the back seat and stuffed the teddy bear in the trunk.`
`"Boy, it must've been expensive."`
`"...Ah...`
` yeah,`
` I guess."`
`At first, I thought he was sweating because of the heat.`
`...But he's acting oddly.`
`As if he has a high fever and his consciousness is coming and going.`
`"What's wrong?`
` Are you feeling okay?"`
`"......I guess,`
` well...`
` I think... I have a cold."`
`"That's not good.`
` Do you want to swing by the clinic?`
` I'll give you a checkup."`
`"...Thank you...`
` Huff...`
` huff......"`
`When he called earlier, he didn't sound this way.`
`Did he become ill all of a sudden?`
`"Why don't you put the seat back?`
` Is it too cold?`
` Are you okay?"`
`"......Huff...`
` ...huff...`
` ......huff...`
` ......"`
`His face is turning pale.`
` I can tell he has a high fever.`
`......Satoshi-kun was pushing himself to buy this teddy bear.`
`A teddy bear this size can't be that cheap.`
`For him to earn enough money in such a short period of time, he must've worked hard and long hours.`
`Maybe he felt relieved now that he got the teddy bear he had wanted to buy.`
`...It's not unusual for a person to collapse after reaching his big goal.`
`"...I'm proud of you`
` for earning enough money to buy such a huge teddy bear.`
` Satoko-chan will be so happy."`
`"............I... hope so..."`
`"I'm sure she will be!`
` I guarantee it!!"`
`"......Our`
` aunt is gone.`
` ...Our uncle isn't coming back...`
` There's`
` nobody who can hurt her in any way anymore...... right?"`
`"That's right.`
` There won't be anyone who can hurt her.`
` So you can relax now..."`
`"......Our aunt is gone...`
` right?`
` She died... right...?"`
`"Yes.`
` She is dead.`
` I performed the autopsy.`
` There can be no mistake.`
` She'll never abuse Satoko-chan again."`
`"......Are you sure?`
` Did you really confirm`
` that she's dead?"`
`"Yes.`
` I sure did."`
`"......So...`
` even if I see someone...`
` who looks just like her......`
` it's not her, right?`
` ...It's not like she was actually alive`
` and recovered, right?"`
`"No.`
` That's not possible.`
` She'll never come back to us."`
`"Then,`
` then...`
` look,`
` that lady....`
` She looks like her, but...`
` that's not my aunt, right...?`
` Right...?!"`
`Satoshi-kun pointed at the oncoming car in fear.`
`Of course, the car passed by so quickly that I couldn't see her face.`
` But no matter how much she looks like her, it's impossible for her to be alive.`
`"Look, look!!`
` Look at her!!`
` She looks exactly like her!`
` She even looked at me!!"`
`"Calm down, Satoshi-kun.`
` Your aunt is dead.`
` So no matter how much she looks like her, it's not your aunt."`
`"But... she looks just like her,`
` look...`
` No,`
` it must be her...`
` That's my aunt...`
` She's......`
` I killed her...`
` I bashed her head in... repeatedly...`
` why?`
` ...Why.........?!"`
`I can only try to stay calm and drive.`
`Satoshi-kun is losing his cool.`
`He's delusional.`
` He's seeing his aunt coming back from the dead.`
`Then I finally realize...`
`Satoshi-kun...... is displaying symptoms of the terminal stage...!`
`...I need to examine him once I get to the clinic.`
`It's different from Satoko-chan's case.`
`We already have the cure.`
` We can treat Satoshi-kun.`
`If I talk to the Mountain Dogs, they'll take care of the murder of his aunt.`
`So I can both save him from going terminal and give him back his peaceful days with Satoko-chan.`
`He was deranged until just a minute ago, but now he's gone quiet.`
`...He didn't fall asleep.`
`I must get to the clinic while Satoshi-kun remains in this calm state.`
`There's no guarantee that he won't attack me while I'm driving.`
`...As if he knows what is going through my mind, Satoshi-kun spoke to me quietly.`
`"......Coach,`
` is this...`
` the curse of Oyashiro-sama?"`
`"There is no curse.`
` Please try to stay focused."`
`"......Satoko,`
` sorry...`
` Until just before I bought the teddy bear...`
` I was thinking about running away...`
` That's why...`
` Oyashiro-sama got angry...`
` I'm a failure...`
` as a big brother...`
` I'm...`
` I'm......"`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` Close your eyes and get some rest.`
` We'll get to the clinic soon.`
` Then I'll give you some medicine, okay?"`
`"...I feel like... there are maggots in my blood...`
` It itches..."`
`"Don't scratch!!`
` Don't claw at your throat!!"`
`We arrived at the back door to the clinic.`
`I slammed the brakes, and stopped the car.`
`Satoshi-kun has already started to claw at his throat.`
` I can't stop him by myself.`
` I asked for some help through the intercom.`
`Some staff members came out immediately.`
`Maybe Satoshi-kun was surprised to see so many people at once, because he started to resist.`
`......I don't even need to run tests, he's at L5.`
`He's reached the terminal stage, and his thoughts must be filled with delusions.`
`Maybe he thinks that the staff members want to kill him.`
`The staff members pinned his arms and legs down and gave him a shot to put him to sleep.`
`"....C-Coach,`
` Coach,`
` please,`
` help me...!!!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll make you better, so please relax."`
`"...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` Coach`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` Please`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` take`
` care`
` of`
` Satoko`
`..."`
`Please take care of Satoko.`
`After saying those words, he fell unconscious.`
`"My, my.`
` What's going on?"`
`"...Satoshi-kun suddenly displayed symptoms...`
` Considering the amount of stress he's been under, it was just a matter of time.`
` Or... maybe he was holding it back until he bought the teddy bear."`
`"It's interesting that somehow we always find a live specimen around Watanagashi.`
` Do you think it's the curse of Oyashiro-sama?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`I don't have time to listen to her nonsense.`
