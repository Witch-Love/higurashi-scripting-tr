`After the proprietor finished serving the food, she bowed and left.`
`The room was very tastefully put together, reminding them of a tea ceremony room. While it was sparsely decorated, quite a bit of money had obviously gone into it.`
`This was a very famous Japanese restaurant, where many high-up officials and other important people held secret meetings.`
`Takano was there, accompanied by about five gentlemen.`
`She was sitting slightly further away from the men.`
`They were clearly in a much more important position than she was.`
`One of the men, wearing an expensive double-breasted suit, told Takano not to be so nervous.`
`"Please relax, Takano-san.`
` What we read is very interesting to us.`
` I can't believe this research was just sitting there for dozens of years..."`
`"Hmm, it is surprising.`
` I thought most of the research on BC weapons the Japanese military conducted during the war failed to bear fruit, `
`and nothing was left after the US military confiscated even the fundamental research."`
`"...I heard this research was barely even glanced at by the top brass."`
`"I see...`
` So that's why nobody knew about it and GHQ didn't investigate it.`
` In that sense at least, it was truly fortunate."`
`"Hmm.`
` Interesting that Dr. Takano's research would be succeeded by a different Takano-san.`
` I suppose that's fate.`
` It's like the deceased is using your body to complete his life's work."`
`"Hee hee.`
` Maybe that's true.`
` I feel a mysterious connection to him, too."`
`Takano adored Takano Hifumi and called him grandfather, but she hadn't revealed that relationship to others.`
`She realized it wouldn't be beneficial for people to think she was involving personal feelings in her continuing Dr. Takano's research.`
`So publicly, she once had exchanges with Takano Hifumi, and after his death discovered his research documents with his remains, and chose to carry it on...`
` At least that's how the story went.`
`"Well, then...`
` what do you think?"`
`"Hmm.`
` The Defense Agency was very interested.`
` Ha ha ha!`
` According to Nakagawa-kun, the Defense Agency's Technical Research and Development Institute showed great interest.`
` They offered to sponsor the research too."`
`"Oh, that's wonderful!`
` Congratulations, Takano-san!"`
`"Thank you very much...!"`
`"Here's what they said.`
` There's a research council for next-generation deterrents being led by experts from several different ministries.`
` One of those is called the Alphabet Project. `
`Have you heard of it, Takano-san?"`
`There was no way she would know about something like that.`
`But it was very possible for these nationalists to research something dangerous without citizens knowing about it.`
`Society forms something like a web made of connections between people.`
`People hold hands with other people who share the same ideas, and end up knitting a net.`
`Of course, some nets are well-known, but there are some secret ones too.`
`So there was no way of guessing just how the men at this meeting were connected.`
`A society involving research into deterrent weapons for the next generation.`
`The Alphabet Project.`
`With those words, it was possible to imagine what that might entail.`
`Deterrent weapons.`
` That usually refers to nuclear technology.`
`Weapons are normally used to destroy enemies.`
`However, the general idea of deterrent weapons is very different.`
` The assumption is that they won't actually be used against anyone.`
`Nuclear weapons are largely used as a threat to prevent enemy invasion.`
`Both the US and Soviets possess large stockpiles of nuclear arms, keeping each other in check.`
`But they will never actually use them.`
`Because if they did, there'd be a nuclear war, and both countries would be destroyed.`
`So they're like a legendary weapon you never draw.`
`Of course, that last resort only works because both sides have nuclear weapons.`
`If one side lacks them, then they lose all military negotiation power.`
`In other words, nations without nukes are powerless before nuclear armed states.`
`"That can't be true. Japan abandoned nukes and it still functions as a nation today,"`
` Or so some people may be thinking, but they're wrong.`
`Japan abandoned nukes, but lies under the nuclear umbrella by allying itself with America.`
`That means the nation functions thanks to America's nukes.`
`However, that also means we must resign ourselves to forever being a vassal of America.`
`...In order for Japan to escape that and become a powerful nation equal to America, it must possess its own deterrence arms and step out of that nuclear umbrella. `
`That society must have been put together by experts who believe in that ideal.`
`Given that, even the name "Alphabet Project" makes sense.`
`Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction.`
`However, weapons of mass destruction aren't always nuclear.`
`They also include biological weapons and chemical weapons.`
`Atomic,`
` Biological,`
` Chemical, the initials of these three words make up ABC.`
` That's why weapons of mass destruction are sometimes called ABC weapons. `
`(I won't go into weapons of mass destruction that don't belong to those three categories.)`
`ABC--Alphabet.`
`In other words, "Alphabet Project" must be a code for research into weapons of mass destruction.`
`As it happened, this guess of Takano's was correct.`
`"By rights, Japan should possess nuclear arms.`
` We established ourselves as a peace-loving nation after the war, and after our vast international contributions, we've been recognized as a permanent member of the UN. `
`Yet until we possess nuclear arms, we won't be recognized as a proper nation.`
` That is the long-held desire of postwar Japan."`
`"Exactly.`
` However, realistically, thanks to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the major nations hold a monopoly on nukes. `
`Worse, our domestic public opinion is growing allergic to nukes, so foreign and domestic pressures make implementing them impossible."`
`"Biological and chemical weapons are sometimes known as the poor man's nuke.`
` Small countries that can't own nuclear weapons have already started research into that kind of weaponry."`
`"Ha ha ha, Takano-san, please don't misunderstand us, okay?`
` The purpose of our research isn't to obtain a biological weapon.`
` Instead, our goal is to prevent such weapons from coming into Japan from other countries. `
`So this is research into self-defense. I want you to understand that."`
`"Yes.`
` I'm aware of that."`
`Takano hated this Japanese tendency to make excuses,`
` but she didn't let it show on her face.`
`No matter what they said, they already saw the value in using this research toward biological weaponry.`
`However, in truth, that was just an excuse as well.`
`If they actually wanted to research biological weapons,`
` then it would be much faster to research diseases like smallpox and anthrax instead of an unidentified disease like Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`So it wasn't actually correct to say the Defense Agency was interested in it as a biological weapon.`
`In other words...`
` ...Takano needed a powerful sponsor who could back her up with funding, personnel, and a facility to conduct her research.`
`So she used her connections and turned to the old men behind the government and economy, `
`reaching out to each of them, and getting them to forcibly pull funding out of the Defense Agency under the excuse of its application toward biological weaponry. That was the truth.`
`Therefore, her project wasn't officially recognized by the Defense Agency.`
`...To be exact, the people who secretly controlled the Defense Agency were the ones who knew about it.`
`These masterminds diverted funding from the Defense Agency to the Alphabet Project.`
`And then they pushed for Takano's research to be a part of it.`
`Takano gets her funding, and the influencers get to drain public funds through kickbacks.`
`...Considering that, it was doubtful this project was genuinely about researching the next generation of deterrence arms.`
`It was probably just an excuse for the masterminds to funnel money into their own pockets.`
`Well, those complicated matters didn't matter to Takano.`
`Whatever those old men and influencers were planning wasn't her business.`
` As long as she could get the funding for her research, that was enough.`
`Either way,`
` Takano had found her sponsor.`
`It was one of the biggest organizations around, too.`
` This had always been her grandfather's dream.`
`Takano was trying to stay calm, but she was about to jump up and down in excitement.`
`"Nakagawa-kun says that once the research gets underway, he doesn't mind buying it out.`
` Although it's still incomplete, he definitely sees potential in it."`
`"You're absolutely right.`
` This research is only halfway complete. Sufficient funding, facilities, and personnel will be indispensible."`
`"About that...`
` Here's where the negotiations start, but...`
` Apparently they wish to take on this research in its entirety.`
` ...I feel bad saying this, but they think the burden is too much for you to bear alone."`
`Hearing that put quite the damper on Takano's ecstasy.`
`"I, I'm not trying to make money off of this.`
` I am working as a researcher purely out of intellectual curiosity.`
` What I need is a sponsor.`
` And what they seek are results. `
`That was the relationship I had hoped to establish."`
`Takano realized she was talking rather breathlessly, so she tried to calm herself down.`
`...Either way, they'd be backing the research.`
`Considering they're hoping for results that merit the budget, they probably feel that Takano is still too young to handle it.`
`"I know, I know.`
` You've been working on this for a long time, and you don't want anyone to just grab it from you, right?`
` I totally understand that.`
` Of course, we've already informed them. `
`So here's the compromise we came up with."`
`"First, we'll start your research as an offshoot of the Alphabet Project.`
` Once you have the board of directors's approval, you'll be given official funding. `
`We'll have you participate in the project as an 'associate researcher', and you'll take part in the research that way."`
`If she wanted their funding, she'd have to fall under their authority, of course.`
` So far she had no objections.`
`"However, the research society has listed a few conditions in exchange for funding this project. `
`First, as was just mentioned, is to entrust the position of lead researcher to an individual that's skilled and talented in this field of research."`
`"I hate to interject, but who would be more knowledgeable about this than me? Other than the late Dr. Takano, of course..."`
`"Now, now, now!`
` Please, calm down, Takano-san!`
` I understand how you feel."`
`"Still, how is this any different from selling my research to this individual?`
` This isn't what we discussed at all."`
`"Wa ha ha ha.`
` Calm down, Takano-san."`
`Those cunning old men didn't miss sight of the faint leak of anger that crossed Takano's expression.`
`They gave evasive laughs, as if remarking how immature she still was if she let her emotions show over such a little thing.`
`However, they weren't laughing to look down on Takano.`
`On the contrary, they were trying to tell her to wait until the end.`
`"Of course, we'll make sure you get your way.`
` Koizumi-sensei told me to take good care of you.`
` Do you think I would just ignore you after he told me that?`
` Don't worry.`
` Please let me work things out. `
`I'll make sure you'll be happy."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"You see, I get to select the person in charge.`
` Wahahahahahaha!"`
`Everyone chortled except Takano.`
` After a moment, she joined in.`
`In other words, he meant that he would find just the right person.`
`The Defense Agency had suggested finding an expert to lead the project because they didn't feel comfortable with just Takano.`
`However, Takano's sponsor was the one tasked to find such a person.`
`In that moment, Takano realized it.`
` ...Ah, how wonderful it is to have such a powerful backer.`
`"Let me work it out.`
` I'll find some candidates for you.`
` All you have to do is pick the one you think would be the most suitable."`
`Takano felt better after hearing that.`
`While she wouldn't be the official head of the project, she would end up leading it from the shadows.`
`...Of course, she wasn't an expert, per se.`
`Having a partner would actually be beneficial.`
`"Give me some time to talk to the other end.`
` I'll make sure you'll be happy with the outcome. Please just be patient for a while."`
`"I understand.`
` Thank you for everything...!"`
`"Oh, by the way, it's not just the Defense Agency.`
` Nagata-kun from the Ministry of Health and Welfare is willing to help you, too.`
` He introduced me to Itou-kun from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. `
`He's willing to help you with equipment and other technology."`
`"R-Really?`
` Thank you so much!"`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` This is a national project, isn't it?`
` Congratulations, Takano-san!!`
` This is all because of your effort and the deceased Dr. Takano's hard work."`
`"Oh, no!`
` This is all because of Dr. Takano.`
` I haven't done anything yet...!"`
`"Ha ha ha ha.`
` Being humble is a good virtue.`
` Just like Koizumi-sensei told me, you truly are a nice person, aren't you?`
` No wonder he adores you!"`
`"Anyway, they want you to join the Defense Agency.`
` Luckily, you have a doctor's license, right?`
` We'll secure your position as a medical officer of the TRDI."`
`"Do you mean... I'll be a public servant?`
` I wasn't expecting that..."`
`"All the organizations that are involved with the Alphabet Project are public institutions. `
`The SDF is actually interested in this research as well, and they're making strong requests to dispatch some of their personnel, too.`
` So depending on the circumstances, you may be treated as an SDF member."`
`"Well, just think of those matters as officials squabbling over jurisdiction.`
` So to stand above those officials, you'll need your own official position. `
`No matter what, we'll make sure you'll be happy, so please don't worry about anything."`
`"I understand.`
` I'll let you work things out.`
` But knowing Dr. Takano's research was once rejected by the old Japanese military,`
` it's hard to believe that the Self-Defense Force is interested in it now."`
`"Well... that couldn't be stopped.`
` With the war situation worsening, the Japanese military sought something with immediate effect, something that could turn the war around. `
`I don't think they were looking down on Dr. Takano's research."`
`That wasn't true, of course.`
` Takano already heard that confession from the old man.`
`She exhaled. To her, it was like the meeting in front of her was happening somewhere far away.`
`She had longed for this day to come, and worked so hard to reach it.`
`Finally, her grandfather and his research were attaining recognition.`
` This was the day she had dreamed of.`
`So she was frightened just imagining that it might be an actual dream.`
`True joy can't be felt all at once. Oftentimes, it's a delayed reaction.`
`...Takano thought that must be exactly what she was feeling.`
`"...I think.`
` I imagine you'll probably be given a field officer's rank.`
` Since you'll be second in command, you'll likely be a Major."`
`"That's wonderful!!`
` Major Takano, huh?`
` My, I'm a little jealous!!`
` As a man, I wish I had a rank like that...`
` Boy oh boy, Major Takano, huh? Mm-hmm!"`
`"A Major?`
` What does that signify?"`
`"Well, it's reasonably high in the rank system of the Self-Defense Forces.`
` It's like a sub-manager at a company, I guess.`
` That will be your rank once the project gets underway."`
`"It's equivalent to a Lieutenant Commander in the old Japanese military.`
` What a coincidence!`
` Dr. Takano was also a lieutenant commander in the old military."`
`Takano remembered suddenly.`
`They were right.`
` Her grandfather had been a Lieutenant Commander in the Japanese military.`
`Everything she had done until today was so she could continue her grandfather's research.`
`Now everything had fallen into place.`
` She had even been granted the same rank as her grandfather.`
`She had always believed that succeeding his research would be proof that they had a bond tighter than blood.`
`And now she would even be the same rank as him.`
` This is fate, Takano thought.`
`...Maybe this is even a message from Grandpa?`
`Yes, it must have been a shout of encouragement from Heaven.`
`It was proof that she inherited not only his research, but his will as well.`
`Takano couldn't help but feel a sense of destiny for attaining the rank of Major.`
`"...Grandpa.`
` ......I'm... finally here."`
`Nobody else could hear her say that.`
`But her grandfather in Heaven could.`
` That's what Takano believed.`
`She had only come so far.`
` There were still a lot of things to do for this research to be recognized as a great work.`
`Otherwise, her grandfather won't become a god.`
` She wouldn't become one, either.`
`............`
`"You must become a god." That was in her grandfather's will.`
`"I was unable to do so." That line preceded it.`
`It was her grandfather's dying wish.`
`Her grandfather entrusted it to her.`
` All of his research.`
`A god can't be physically brought back to life.`
`A god is made in the hearts of the people who remain alive.`
`Her grandfather will live on in her heart.`
`His exploits will be known to many, and all the scholars will fight to read his documents.`
` To steal them from each other.`
`And they will learn about Hifumi Takano, who began his research during the war.`
` They will know that nobody understood him, and that he ended up devoting his lonely life to his research. `
`And finally, they will extol his grand achievement...`
