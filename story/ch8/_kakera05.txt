`I was half asleep, so I didn't even hear the phone ringing nearby.`
`After a while, I finally realized the phone was ringing... and a ringing phone means there's some kind of an emergency.`
`It's two in the morning.`
` Who would even call me at this time of the night?`
`"......Hello, this is Irie."`
`"I'm sorry to bother you, Dr. Irie."`
`It's Takano-san.`
`She's never called me for a personal reason.`
`At the Institute, she's ranked just below me, so she's basically responsible for running it.`
`......So for her to call me this late at night, it must be an emergency.`
`"......Sorry it took me so long.`
` Is it true that we have another terminal patient?"`
`"Yes.`
` I was hoping to find a living specimen, so this is perfect.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`I initially thought that she'd abducted someone.`
`The man had already been moved to the research area in the clinic's basement.`
`Having been tied down to the examination table, he's struggling against his restraints, but more as though he's deranged than actually resisting.`
`I can't even understand what he's saying. He sounds angry, sorrowful, and like a child throwing a tantrum all at once.`
`......It's obvious that he's not in the right state of mind.`
`"...Anyway, let's put him under anesthesia.`
` He might kill himself otherwise."`
`"I wanted to observe him a little longer, but I guess I have no other choice."`
`One of the staff with a white gown got the anesthesia ready.`
`Even a normal person would struggle to escape a restraining table in this suspicious room.`
`But this man's behavior is at an abnormal level...`
`I'm sure Okonogi-san and his friends from the Mountain Dogs are the ones who captured him. Capturing a man in this state of mind couldn't have been an easy task.`
`According to Takano, she ran into this patient on her way home from the clinic by accident.`
`She brought him back here, tested him, and the result came back positive.`
`...Of course, I have no intention of just believing what she's telling me.`
`But there is no question that this man is at the terminal stage, and a live specimen is exactly what we need to research the syndrome.`
`"Who is this man anyway?"`
`"Hee hee.`
` He had something wrapped in newspaper.`
` What do you think was in it?"`
`"......Ugh... what is this?"`
`There's something wrapped in a bloody newspaper on a tray nearby.`
`Looking at the blood-drenched paper, I can only imagine there is something gruesome inside of it.`
`Yet Takano-san looked like she wanted to surprise me with something interesting.`
`"Oh...... god, this is awful..."`
`It's...`
` a bloody right arm.`
`The man on the table still has his.`
` ...This right arm doesn't belong to him...`
` ...So who does it belong to?`
`I am used to looking at things like this, as a doctor.`
`......But the horrible cross section makes me want to look away.`
`...It wasn't done according to a medically acceptable method, that's for sure.`
`...It was obviously done out of cruelty.`
`"Judging by the situation, we can assume this man cut off this arm.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`"...So he's the culprit behind the body dumping that's been occurring in the neighborhood?"`
`At that point, there was no way of knowing who the right arm belonged to.`
`But the next morning, the dismemberment murder of the damn construction site director was reported,`
` and they mentioned that his right arm was still missing, so we learned who the arm belonged to...`
`"This man has a criminal record and he's on probation.`
` Yet he committed another crime.`
` I bet he dismantled the body in order to hide it."`
`"I'm sure it depends on the circumstances, but he'll get more than just a few years in prison."`
`"Hee hee.`
` So you won't hesitate to dissect a scumbag like him, right?"`
`"......Who knows. Maybe he was a scumbag before and became violent due to the syndrome,`
` or maybe he had gone straight, but became violent again due to the syndrome. `
`The former is one thing, but if it's the latter case, it's not his fault."`
`That's why Hinamizawa Syndrome is so terrifying.`
`...We can't tell if the syndrome is the cause of the crime, or if it's simply a problem of a human nature.`
`......But what causes a defect of human nature in the first place?`
`That was precisely Irie's area of research.`
`Hate the crime, not the criminal.`
`...Can criminals only be corrected by punishing them with imprisonment?`
`If a person commits a crime because of a mental disorder, but then gets treatment, he is corrected.`
`In other words, there are no crimes in this world, only patients awaiting treatment without anyone else being able to understand them.`
`In medieval times, patients with mental disorders were said to be possessed by demons and they were either confined or killed.`
`Centuries after, they were finally acknowledged as mentally ill people who needed treatment...`
`...Perception can change with time.`
`Even if they are called criminals now, maybe after several centuries, those criminals will be acknowledged as patients who were entitled to appropriate treatment.`
`Explaining crimes through illness instead of malice.`
`That's my life's work.`
`Hinamizawa Syndrome is a strange disease that can support my theory.`
`Solving its mysteries is extremely important to me.`
`To solve those mysteries...`
` I need a medical sacrifice.`
`It's an extremely sinful thing to do... but there's no way to unravel this without it.`
`...The Irie Institute was authorized to take such drastic measures if necessary.`
`That's why I was asked about it so many times when I accepted the position of director.`
`And finally the opportunity is here.`
`...This will be the first step of our research on this strange disease...`
`But even now...... I am a little hesitant.`
`I've opened up human bodies in many surgeries.`
`What I'll be doing on this man is something very similar......`
` But there's also something that's very different.`
`What I did before was part of treatment.`
`I did it to save the patients' lives.`
`I did it so the patients could have a better future.`
`But what I'm trying to do here isn't treatment.`
` ...He will die at the end of it.`
`His death will be far from humane.`
`...I'm going to violate nature and force him to stay alive ...while I open up his living brain.`
`"Director Irie?`
` Are you listening?"`
`"Eh,`
` ahh,`
` sorry.`
` Could you repeat that?"`
`"I believe it best that we submit the dissection proposal to Tokyo and request their assistance.`
` He's not only alive, he's also in the terminal stage, so he's an extremely important specimen. `
`We must conduct the dissection very carefully."`
`"...That's true.`
` You're right.`
` Let's do as you say."`
`"I think we'll have a few days before the dissection.`
` So I want to run some reaction tests once he's off the anesthetic."`
`"...Do you think that's safe?`
` Even if he's restrained, we don't know what will happen."`
`"We finally have the opportunity to test a live specimen.`
` We can't only look into his brain.`
` Hee hee hee hee..."`
`Takano-san's unusual cheerfulness made me feel odd.`
`...Maybe her reaction is normal. Maybe I am the one who's not reacting normally in this situation.`
`I'm here only for the research.`
`So I should be excited to have the opportunity to perform our first live dissection.`
`But I'm still hesitant.`
`How can I call myself a researcher?`
`Researchers of the past were brave enough to cross the line, and that's how they accomplished many things.`
`I've seen many brains. I've operated on them.`
`I've lost some patients, too.`
`But I never thought anything of it, because I knew I did the right thing.`
`......Even when my hard work was denied afterwards.`
`If it pained me to think of that, then I just needed to advance the field of medicine to ensure their deaths weren't wasted.`
`...That's the true form of those advancing the field of medicine.`
`Yet... why was my heart tormented so much just by changing the name from "treatment" to "dissection"?`
`...Does it mean I'm not man enough to emulate those great men of the past who opened the doors to new medicine? ...That I don't have the power to develop new advances myself?`
`"...Hey,`
` what's the matter, Director?`
` Are you feeling okay?"`
`Takano is pretending to be concerned about me.`
` But...... she knows.`
`She knows I'm still hesitating.`
`And she's telling me that I should be ashamed, as a researcher, for feeling that way.`
`............I shook my head to clear it of sleepiness.`
`Remember the resolve that brought me here to this day.`
`I already have blood on my hands.`
`But if I stop now, their lives will be wasted.`
`...Those who shed their blood can only rest in peace once they've become the cornerstones of great research.`
`I shook my head once more and reminded myself that I'm a researcher.`
`"No,`
` I was just thinking.`
` Takano-san, please make some arrangement with Tokyo,`
` and let me know when it's done."`
`"Okay, understood.`
` ...Hee hee hee!`
` This is really exciting."`
`The least I can do is my best, so his life won't be wasted.`
`If he bleeds, I can't waste even a drop of his blood.`
`After scolding my staff for their indiscretion of discussing the dissection with such excitement, I returned to my office.`
