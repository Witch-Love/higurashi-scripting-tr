`This piece is the only one that's so distorted.`
`That's because it's from long before June 1983.`
`Therefore, the existence of this piece has no effect whatsoever in the game we're playing on this board.`
`But is this really a useless piece?`
`The identity of Rule Y has been completely exposed by now.`
`With the backing of a mighty organization, it is powerful enough to swallow up the small solidarity of individuals.`
`I almost gave up on this game because of its irrational power.`
`That's why I'm thinking...`
` that maybe there's a piece hidden somewhere that's strong enough to fight against such a formidable enemy.`
`Mamoru Akasaka works at the police headquarters in Tokyo, and might have the power to stand up to such a vast conspiracy.`
`Can his power withstand even Rule Y?`
`Just like Keiichi Maebara defeated Rule Z, will he be able to defeat Rule Y so easily?`
`...We need everyone's strength.`
` So Akasaka's strength is needed as well...`
