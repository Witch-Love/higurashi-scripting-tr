`"Allow me to introduce you.`
` This is Major Takano.`
` Major, this is Dr. Kyousuke Irie."`
`"H,`
` Hello,`
` I'm Irie."`
`Irie seemed extremely nervous at our first meeting.`
`He probably thought I was in charge of some suspicious organization.`
`"Hee hee.`
` Please relax.`
` Call me Takano."`
`"Thank you.`
` Thank you for having me here, I really appreciate it."`
`"Please have a seat."`
`"A model, lower middle class citizen" was a good way to describe Kyousuke Irie's demeanor.`
`One could also say he was the stereotypical type of person to get conveniently discarded after those crafty elders used their seniority to constantly pick on him.`
`He certainly doesn't seem as cunning as I am.`
`But that doesn't mean he isn't ambitious.`
`Like me, he's a young person who dreams of accomplishing something great and leaving his name upon generations to come.`
`While he acts humble in person like this, his articles were actually progressive as well as aggressive. The gap between the two was quite intense.`
`"I've read the data concerning this Hinamizawa Syndrome."`
`"What did you think?"`
`"Well...... it's really quite the shock. `
`It's very possible that this is something that steps onto the dark side of today's medicine, but I can hardly control my intellectual excitement in knowing it's a mystery that has yet to be solved."`
`Hearing that made me chuckle.`
`Irie is more than interested in Hinamizawa Syndrome, which is good enough for me.`
`She had been through the wringer with far too many people to reach this day.`
` So her honed intuition could tell.`
`...She would get along well with this man.`
`Even if he isn't useful to me, he won't cause any problems.`
`...For both me and my sponsor, he's the best person possible for the job.`
`"I was shocked too.`
` To imagine a man of your experience and knowledge was just wasting away in the medical office without any responsibilities or work to accomplish. `
`I have to say that was a grave loss to the medical field."`
`"......Ha ha ha."`
`Irie laughed.`
`He probably thought I didn't know, but I had received detailed documents on him.`
` So I knew why he was exiled from the limelight despite his rare talent and achievements.`
`He displayed extraordinary skill working under a neurosurgery expert, and everyone expected a bright future from him.`
`But he was kicked out due to an ethical controversy.`
`Irie's pet theory was that the antisocial behavior of individuals...`
` could be explained by brain disorders.`
`He believed that no one in this world was born a villain, and that they were all just poor patients in need of treatment.`
`He proposed that they were all proper and normal when born, yet as they matured, `
`psychogenesis and various exogenous factors caused brain disorders that made them into villains.`
`Therefore, what those evil people need isn't punishment, it is treatment, and if their diseases are treated, they will become good citizens again.`
`That manner of thinking actually fell in line with the Confucian belief of innate human goodness.`
`According to this theory, humans are born with the capacity for altruism toward their kind, and it is only afterward that they learn and acquire cruelty.`
`...Irie believed that acquisition was the result of brain disorders.`
`The human brain creates human thoughts.`
`Therefore, if one becomes emotionally ill, that means their brain is ill. So if their brain gets treatment, they will recover emotionally, too.`
`That field was called psychosurgery.`
`It's fallen out of practice in the current Heisei era, but the surgical techniques were applauded until mid-Showa.`
`Especially since it produced spectacular results on a chronic mental patient that was said to be incurable. The man who invented it even won a Nobel Prize.`
` That was how revolutionary it was.`
`Humans think. That's why they become ill.`
`Everyone knows that's why those who overthink matters are prone to mental illness.`
`When the organ that thinks and debates grows ill, humans deviate from social behavior.`
` That part is called the frontal lobe.`
`Put simply, psychosurgery is surgery performed to operate on the frontal lobe.`
`This kind of surgery doesn't require removing the whole epicranium.`
`A small hole is drilled through the cranium, and a special scalpel is inserted down to cut it.`
` It's not a major surgery, just a technique for quickly operating on the precious frontal lobe.`
`Indeed, it was revolutionary in its simplicity.`
`All the severely ill mental patients miraculously recovered, so the technique spread around the world quickly.`
`Those with obstinate and chronic mental illnesses...`
`The severely ill trapped in deep, inescapable depression...`
`All of those could be saved by this technique.`
`Throughout history, humans have come up with many different religions and magic tricks to heal emotional injuries.`
`So, needless to say, the idea of being able to treat them with a surgical technique`
` was truly revolutionary.`
`Irie admired psychosurgery, and pushed forward in the field of surgical techniques to treat human souls.`
`However, from the modern human rights standpoint, severing a portion of the brain simply because someone is emotionally disturbed is absolutely out of the question.`
`People gradually started to think differently, and said that psychosurgery was inhumane.`
`The frontal lobe controls how people think, but it is also the part that makes humans act human.`
`...There were quite a few cases where that cut caused drastic, irreversible changes in the patient.`
`A baseless happiness born from lack of thought.`
`A change in personality.`
`A loss of interest in everything.`
`Major mood swings due to a lack of control over one's emotions.`
`Some even lost part of their memories.`
`Of course, some didn't even survive the surgery.`
`By the mid-1960s, use of psychosurgery declined.`
` Also, due to development of psychotropic medicine, the surgery was hardly performed anymore anyway.`
`Yet, some people still believed in the idea, and continued to perform the surgery and gather clinical data.`
`They wanted people to recognize the value of the technique once again.`
`Some of these surgeries were performed without consent.`
`One theory is that in Japan alone, there were thousands of people who woke up from general anesthesia`
` only to find part of their brain had been removed.`
`Today, to perform such a surgery without a patient's consent is considered totally unethical, but it was different at the time.`
`For one thing, the idea that doctors required prior patient consent was proliferated in the modern Heisei era.`
`Therefore, people at the time didn't think it was that big of an issue.`
`It was only later that people started to argue that it was inhumane.`
`Finally a decision was reached and the curtain closed with the rejection of psychosurgery.`
`Later the Japanese Society of Psychology and Neurology passed their resolution to end psychosurgery.`
`After that, psychosurgery was banned throughout Japan and made a forbidden subject of Japanese medicine.`
`Irie was the leading person in the field of psychosurgery.`
`He continued to advocate its effectiveness and results.`
`...Therefore, he was treated as a war criminal who practiced inhumane medicine, and he was exiled from the public eye.`
`However, that doesn't mean he changed his beliefs.`
`He still believes that immoral behavior is caused by brain disorders, and the secret of treating them is, in fact, hidden in the brain.`
`So the existence of Hinamizawa Syndrome, caused by parasites living in the brain that control human emotions, actually affirms his theory.`
`"If it's alright with you,`
` I would love to accept this position."`
`Of course.`
` Given Irie's history, he would never turn down this offer.`
`Despite his mild-mannered appearance, Irie was possessed by a mighty ambition.`
`There was no way he didn't desire a chance to complete research that would prove himself to the medical society that ostracized him.`
`I'm handing him that chance on a silver platter.`
`"Thank you very much.`
` I knew you'd accept!`
` We are very lucky to have an expert like you. You'll be a great help."`
`"B-But are you okay with me being the Director...?`
` Wouldn't it be better for you to hold that position, Takano-san?`
` I'm just a simple doctor.`
` Being in charge of other people is..."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll give you my full support.`
` Our sponsor wanted to pick a civilian.`
` Besides, wouldn't you like to be called...`
` Director Irie?`
` Hee hee."`
`"Ah, well...!`
` But... ahahahaha..."`
`Irie laughed to hide his embarrassment.`
`"We're building a research center in Hinamizawa.`
` Publicly, it will be a clinic.`
` So with your consent, Dr. Irie, we'd like to call it the Irie Clinic."`
`"L-Lord of my own castle...`
` Th-That's more than I deserve."`
`"You'll also be placed under the SDF, so you'll be registered as a medical officer with them.`
` Since you'll be my superior, you'll be a Lieutenant Colonel.`
` Lt. Colonel Irie. How does that sound to you?"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha!`
` I'm not a military man.`
` I'd rather refrain from being called Lt. Colonel...`
` Director is already a frightening title as is.`
` Oh my, ahahaha..."`
`He's getting a chance to research brain parasites, plus being given the title of director of a new clinic as camouflage.`
` Plus it comes with staff and funding. `
`He'll even have support from the Defense Agency and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, as well as a research lab with state-of-the-art equipment.`
`No wonder he's laughing so excitedly.`
`However, there are some risks, too.`
`Since he'll be involved with this secret research, he has an obligation to keep it a secret.`
`Also, he is going to an area plagued by a mysterious and bizarre disease.`
` There's no guarantee he won't contract it himself.`
`But Irie is too young to even think about those things.`
`Aware of all the risks, he quickly signed the contract with the ambition to have people recognize his talent once again.`
`When I saw him sign the contract, I finally relaxed.`
`I knew he would agree to join us, but at the same time, I was afraid of the chance that he'd refuse.`
`Selecting a director proved more difficult than expected, and the only candidate Takano paired well with was Irie.`
`...So if Irie refused to take the position, then frankly, she'd be placed in an even worse situation.`
`Now that Irie has agreed to take the position, research on Hinamizawa Syndrome can finally begin.`
`The research center--or rather, the clinic--will be completed next spring.`
`The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Defense Agency will send the best equipment and staff, plus an abundant supply of funds.`
`Then finally, our research will begin in earnest.`
`Everything is going well.`
`Of course it is.`
`I've put so much effort into making sure things went smoothly up to this point.`
`"Okay, that's it.`
` Congratulations, Director Irie!`
` Major, the contract has been signed."`
`"Thank you.`
` I look forward to working with you,`
` Director Irie."`
`"I look forward to working with you too,`
` Takano-san.`
` I hope we can get along.`
` I'll be devoting my best efforts to this!"`
`"No, thank you.`
` Let's both give our best."`
`Now the position of Director has been filled. Everything is set.`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` That's great, just great.`
` Congratulations, Takano-san.`
` No, Major Takano, isn't it?`
` Wa ha ha ha!!"`
`"This was all possible thanks to your assistance.`
` I must give my thanks to all of you."`
`"Oh, don't mention it!`
` But we should save our congratulations until you finish your research, huh?`
` You're only at the starting line, aren't you?"`
`"Exactly.`
` I'll be devoting my every waking moment to this research."`
`"We can hardly wait to see the result of what Dr. Takano couldn't finish!`
` Wa ha ha ha!!"`
`"Well now, Sensei!`
` Let's not talk about business today!`
` Let's have a toast to congratulate Takano-san and the Irie Institute!"`
`"Hello, everyone.`
` I'm Nagata from the Ministry of Health and Welfare.`
` I would like to say a few things before the toast."`
`"Ah, Takano-san, make sure he works hard, okay?`
` His research center will be supporting the Institute.`
` If you need any technical support, just call him."`
`"Make him work hard...?`
` No, no, I have to thank you for your support.`
` I'm Takano.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Takano-san, let me introduce you to these gentlemen.`
` Meet Tomitake-kun and Okonogi-kun from the Self-Defense Force.`
` They're your backup from the SDF.`
` I'll let them introduce themselves."`
`"Nice to meet you.`
` I'm Tomitake.`
` I've been commanded to serve as auditor of this project.`
` I look forward to working with you."`
`The funding for our research is largely coming from the SDF.`
` It's only natural for the SDF to assign a watchdog to make sure reasonable research is taking place.`
`...However, someone in a position like that should be my opponent.`
`...Why was someone in that position invited to this private party?`
`Does that mean this auditor is on my side, too?`
`Seeing that thorough groundwork, I couldn't help but feel the strength of having a sponsor all over again.`
`"I won't be staying in Hinamizawa. I'll only come by routinely to check on the progress of the research."`
`"Oh, that's too bad.`
` Hinamizawa's a beautiful place with clean air.`
` Please come visit us any time. Outside of work too."`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` Thank you.`
` I guess I will."`
`If he really is an auditor, I should maintain a good relationship with this man.`
`He'll hold the key to all future adjustments of our funding so long as we continue drawing it from the SDF.`
`"I'm Okonogi.`
` Nice to meet you."`
`"He's the commanding officer of the Mountain Dogs, one of our unconventional warfare units.`
` They'll be stationed in Hinamizawa to provide you direct support, Major."`
`"Should I consider you my bodyguard then...?"`
`"Their principal duty is guarding VIPs and preserving secrets.`
` Think of them as your hands and feet, and work them hard."`
`"...Thank you."`
`Tomitake seems to be an honest type for a military man, but this Okonogi person looks the complete opposite.`
`His main job is to preserve secrets, but I bet he's also good with espionage tactics like counterintelligence and information control.`
`Yes, that would explain his demeanor.`
`Since the SDF is funding our research on Hinamizawa Syndrome, of course this is considered a military operation.`
`Therefore, this research has to be done in secret.`
`That's why a unit like this is necessary.`
`Besides, it's very reassuring to have someone capable of combat working under me.`
` I should maintain a good relationship with him, too.`
`"Okay!`
` Enough introductions!`
` Come on, Tomitake-kun, you can relax too!`
` Let's put aside our ranks today and have a toast!"`
`While this is supposed to celebrate the establishment of the Irie Institute, Irie himself isn't here...`
`But that is his job, after all.`
`Irie is simply a puppet to fill a seat.`
`Of course, I expect him to help me a little with his expertise, but he's ultimately an outsider.`
`This was supposed to be a gathering where I would show my appreciation to those who helped me establish the Irie Institute,`
` but it has turned into them thanking me for all of my efforts.`
`I'm always the one to pour alcohol for others, but today people are pouring alcohol in my glass.`
`The new participants were trying to make me happy, and all the top people talked to me casually.`
` They all praised my hard work and my efforts.`
`My research is now recognized by many institutions, and I'm ready to spread my wings open wide.`
`And all the people who are expecting some returns once the research accomplishes something are trying to curry favor with me.`
`But right now I'm just very grateful, regardless of their motives.`
`"Let's have a toast to wish the best of luck to Miyo Takano-kun, and also to the new Irie Institute!`
` Arai-sensei`
` please lead the toast!!"`
`It's like a dream.`
`I know.`
`This is just the beginning, and I shouldn't be satisfied with this alone.`
`But just for today, I can forget about everything else and enjoy this celebration.`
`I'm not a heavy drinker.`
` But the drinks taste good tonight, and the more I drink the happier I get. Ah, this really is wonderful...`
`To be called Major by Tomitake and the others is wonderful too.`
`That's the rank my grandfather had during the war.`
`That means I've finally caught up with my grandfather.`
`This is only the beginning.`
`From here on, I intend to reach what my grandfather couldn't.`
`This is the best night of my life...`
`I ended up leaving to fix my makeup.`
`I'm filled with elation.`
`I need to feel fresh air to calm myself down.`
` My heart is about to explode because I'm so happy.`
`The gathering is taking place a little distance away from the main building.`
`The restroom is in the main building, so I need to walk across the hallway.`
`A beautiful and well-maintained Japanese garden is visible from the hallway.`
`It's raining.`
`I usually don't like rain, but I don't mind it at all today. I feel like even the raindrops are congratulating me.`
`The cool air feels pleasant on my hot skin.`
`It took me a moment to notice how unsteady my footsteps had become.`
`Maybe I drank a little too much.`
`It isn't like me to drink more than I can handle.`
`Although this is a party, I don't want to embarrass myself, so I decided to cool off a little by looking at the beautiful Japanese garden.`
`I found an elegant chair set on a red carpet nearby and sat down on it.`
`Since I was with the associates until now, I was forced to constantly be on guard against embarrassing myself,`
` but now that I was alone, I could let go and truly relax.`
`When I look up to the sky, I realize it's still raining hard, but in the distance the horizon is a little lighter.`
`Maybe it won't be raining for much longer.`
`...Well, that's normal.`
` Rain stops eventually.`
`No matter how cold it is, or how hard it's raining,`
` rain stops eventually.`
`I saw a pair of sandals and an umbrella.`
`...Almost inviting me.`
` So I took them into the garden.`
`The tasteless laughter coming from the party sounds far away.`
`I tilted the umbrella and looked up to the sky.`
`I felt the raindrops hit my face.`
`And gazed up at the sky for a while, forgetting all about my hair getting wet.`
