`With this, do I have all the pieces lined up for 1983?`
`It sure is a hard and exhausting job just lining up the pieces for the month of June.`
`But finally I'm at the starting line.`
` Beginning from zero, at last.`
`...Yet... seeing all these colorful Fragments together,`
`I realized just how many sentiments were intertwined around June 1983.`
`I used to think that thoughts of people with no relation to me were useless.`
` But I was wrong.`
`Rika Furude did her best to overcome the fate of June 1983.`
`She did two things.`
`One was to get in touch with the Irie Institute, because she knew she would be protected there.`
`Ironically, Takano from the Irie Institute was the one who wanted to kill her,`
` but it was the best move for her at the time.`
`And the other was to ensure that the Maebara family moved to Hinamizawa.`
`It actually wasn't certain that the Maebara family would move here.`
`...They first decided to move here when the father felt something sentimental at the sight of us on the day he came to view the properties for sale.`
`Therefore, it was necessary for us to play in that field. It was the trigger for the Maebara family's move.`
`It took me so long to find that out, though.`
`After turning various conditions on and off repeatedly, I finally realized that meeting Keiichi's father at that field was the cause.`
`Keiichi Maebara is a very important key for breaking Rule Z, one of the chains that was binding me.`
`He is the fresh air that's powerful enough to break all the old and evil customs in this village.`
`He created many opportunities, but he also provided me with an important clue by letting me know that a strong conviction and the will to believe is what's important in standing up against a powerful fate.`
`...But I wasn't the only one who wanted him here.`
`People in the Sonozaki family who wanted to wipe out the nastier traditions of the village also wished for him.`
`Mion Sonozaki vowed to herself to protect Satoko and Satoshi because she was very much bothered by how irrational the treatment of the Houjou family was.`
`And on the night Satoshi Houjou disappeared, she exploded at Oryou Sonozaki and voiced her true feelings.`
`Oryou Sonozaki understood.`
`Oryou herself had come to understand the wicked customs of the village, and had been wanting to do something about it.`
`But she didn't have the power to do so herself,`
` so she entrusted it to the fresh air that was blowing in from the outside.`
`That was why the lots went on sale, so the Maebara family could move in.`
`Even if I danced in that field, if Oryou hadn't put the lots on sale, Keiichi couldn't have come.`
`And Rena Ryuugu, who provided many important opportunities for Keiichi Maebara,`
` was saved by returning to Hinamizawa, after the deep emotional trauma of her parents' divorce sent her into terminal condition.`
`Keiichi Maebara's wish to restart his life was the same wish Rena Ryuugu had a year prior.`
`Maybe that's why Rena was able to understand Keiichi.`
`It's like the miracle where one can recognize moments in a certain Fragment from another Fragment.`
`......If they can use the lessons learned from one Fragment, then humans won't make those mistakes.`
`The game pieces will make their best moves, and the chances of winning this game of June 1983 will rapidly increase.`
`In other words, Rena Ryuugu makes extremely important moves on this game board without realizing it.`
`The mighty Rule Z that surrounded the Houjou siblings was eventually smashed by their actions.`
`Of course, Satoko overcoming herself was also a big help.`
`Their hands met only because they reached from both sides.`
`Keiichi and Rena are the ones who taught me that.`
`Mion is the one who made it possible for them to move here, and she also helped them to become familiar with the village.`
`That's not all.`
`Irie is also an important piece with significant functions of his own.`
`Feeling empathy for Satoko, he is the most influential piece on the board we call "Hinamizawa Syndrome". His existence is capable of defeating Rule X.`
`Keiichi and Rena's determination and subsequent awakening taught us that it was possible to fight against Rule X, but they didn't defeat it.`
`Defeating Rule X requires the existence of Irie, who has the strong will to discover a cure for the syndrome.`
`I didn't know Irie held this many thoughts within him.`
`I always thought he was rather absent-minded,`
` but he is, in fact, an important and powerful piece.`
`So if we gather all this power... can we win against Takano's will?`
`I've seen Takano's thoughts too.`
`Sadly, her will is strong, and can't be easily broken.`
`It's no wonder our fate in June 1983 has been so hard to shake no matter how hard we fought.`
`The sentiments I've been turning towards it pale in comparison to how many she's brought into it.`
`The weight of our game pieces are different, because I've given up on fighting while she has been risking her life to fight on.`
`...I've spent time sulking and drinking wine to escape from reality. I must be a very light piece indeed.`
`...I can't win against Takano with what I have so far.`
`I need more pieces to be able to win.`
`The officer Ooishi once showed the possibility of becoming a strong ally.`
`But he's under the misunderstanding that the Sonozaki family caused the death of his dear friend, so until that gets resolved, he won't be of any help.`
`I don't know how I can resolve that misunderstanding...`
` ...but I just have to believe in it and keep throwing the die.`
`Just like Keiichi and Rena constitute a chance to change fate,`
` maybe Akasaka has the power to create a chance as well.`
`The curse of 1983 is tied to the curse of Hinamizawa.`
`...A curse can't be broken by inner power alone.`
` It takes power from outside as well.`
`Both sides have to reach out, otherwise the hands won't meet, just like what happened with Satoko.`
`But Akasaka has never come to our aid.`
`Even if he did, it was always too late.`
` Too late.`
` Far too late.`
`But if I keep throwing the die, will Akasaka's game piece eventually appear?`
`The final rule, Rule Y, involves the evil masterminds who are using Takano as their own game piece.`
`...To defeat them, I need a very strong opponent for her.`
` And the only one I can think of`
` is none other than Akasaka from the police headquarters in Tokyo.`
`There are more pieces who would lend me their power.`
`I need to gather them all, otherwise I can't win against Takano.`
`The preparation of the game board is complete.`
` But I need more pieces.`
`...It's only the beginning.`
