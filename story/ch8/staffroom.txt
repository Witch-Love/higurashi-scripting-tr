`Hello, this is Ryukishi07.`
`Thank you for playing Matsuribayashi, no,`
` thank you very much for playing Higurashi - When They Cry until the end.`
`Matsuribayashi is, in a way,`
` the solution episode for the situation with Takano and the kids starting from halfway through Minagoroshi.`
`How can they defeat Takano's conspiracy?`
`How can they reach their ideal ending?`
`I wrote this episode as a duel between you, the reader, and me, the writer.`
`So if you think you created a better resolution (world) than my Matsuribayashi,`
` that means you've defeated Ryukishi07 in this duel.`
`I, Ryukishi07, have provided two resolutions.`
`One is how to fight against Takano.`
`First, here is a hint from the Minagoroshi chapter.`
`You find out about Takano's conspiracy, which relies on Emergency Manual 34.`
`Next, here are hints from the Watanagashi and Meakashi chapters.`
`It has been 48 hours after Rika's death, yet the village is peaceful.`
`If you put those two things together, obviously the basis of the emergency manual which Hifumi Takano wrote, that everyone will develop terminal symptoms within 48 hours, isn't true.`
`When you put these two together, you can realize that if Rika's body was discovered 48 hours after her death,`
` then it's possible to prevent the final operation.`
`In the Matsuribayashi chapter, I wrote about an attacking side and a defending side like a novel. `
`If I were to simply write about the resolution, all I had to write was for Ooishi to announce that Rika died at least 48 hours ago, and Takano's conspiracy would fall apart once the news reached Tokyo.`
`This was rather an easy resolution, like a puzzle, so I'm sure many of you got this right.`
`The other resolution was the ideal ending for this world.`
`To answer this, I have to explain the worldview of this story first.`
`There are hints all over, but the crucial ones are in the Tatarigoroshi and Minagoroshi chapters.`
`Satoko's uncle comes home and Satoko's life becomes miserable.`
`How can she be rescued from that situation?`
`If this story was an exercise in murder, then the Tatarigoroshi chapter is the correct answer.`
`Keiichi kills Teppei and hides his body well. There's a happy ending.`
`But I didn't end the episode that way. Instead, I denied it with a bad ending.`
`The resolution the worldview of Higurashi - When They Cry advocates`
` is a nonviolent one, with everyone united together.`
`That is established in 'Question' chapters such as Onikakushi, Watanagashi, and Tatarigoroshi. `
`In those worlds, when someone becomes suspicious about everything and worries about it alone, things get worse, and that leads to tragedy.`
`The Meakashi chapter is the sublimation of that situation.`
`On the other hand, when one talks to their friends, it's revealed that the causes of the tragedies are quite silly. That is indicated in the Tsumihoroboshi and Minagoroshi episodes.`
`In other words, can you see that in the worlds of Higurashi, anything can be overcome when people talk to each other and help one another?`
`Unfortunately, that doesn't happen in reality...`
`Helping each other creates friction, and often times, working alone is a lot simpler.`
`However, we always hope that we can connect with other people and understand each other, so that we can face any difficulty...`
`In that sense, this world is a fantasy.`
`That's right.`
` In the worlds of Higurashi, there is one magical rule.`
`That is to talk to others and accept help from them. Then you can defeat anything.`
`With that, it is possible to make a miracle happen.`
`If that could be cast into an absolute rule, it would be a sort of magical`
` "systematic miracle".`
`Just like what Hanyuu and her friends said in the story.`
`That is the worldview of Higurashi - When They Cry.`
`If you follow that rule and think about an ideal ending, I bet the first thing you'll think about is an ending where all the club members unite and defeat Takano.`
`Actually, there are scenes in the Matsuribayashi chapter that affirm that sort of ending.`
`However, at the same time, Takano is described as a very lonely person.`
` By doing so, I raise a question about the resolution.`
`Everyone else unites, defeats Takano, and makes her into a sacrifice. This is a happy ending... for everyone except Takano.`
`It is a very popular style of story for the protagonists to unite together and sacrifice the antagonist.`
`Aliens come to the earth to invade us, so the world unites and defeats the aliens.`
` Hooray for humans, and we must all get along.`
` This is a very popular storyline all over the world.`
`There are plenty of stories that use aliens, devils, or monsters as clear "bad guys", and make them into sacrifices.`
`Two parties fighting with each other become allies once the third party shows up. Storylines like these are indeed exciting...`
`By adding a sacrifice, differing parties unite and become allies. To create this situation, there has to be always the third party (the sacrifice) as well.`
`I'm sure many of those who created such stories must have already noticed that.`
`We always add a third enemy that can't possibly unite with us.`
`To make up with each other, we try to find a common enemy.`
`Am I the only one who feels that describes our world today?`
`In reality, this world belongs only to humans.`
`There are no aliens or devils or monsters.`
`So for us to find an enemy, we'll have to fight each other forever.`
`To make up with each other, we need a new enemy, so we just end up fighting someone else.`
`In this chapter of Higurashi, I declared that to be the demon of the world of man.`
`With these explanations of the worldview here in mind,`
` do you wonder if the resolution of defeating Takano is in fact an ideal resolution of the Matsuribayashi chapter?`
`That's right.`
` It's basically the same foolishness found in Tatarigoroshi.`
`(According to that logic, the Minagoroshi chapter isn't the best resolution for the problems that surround Satoko either.`
` Do you understand that...?)`
`How can they make up with Takano?`
`You wouldn't suggest to make Tokyo into a new enemy and let the club members join with Takano, would you?`
`If I continue to talk about this issue, I will probably end up mentioning something religious, so let me stop here.`
`What kind of ending would be the best outcome following the worldview of Higurashi - When They Cry?`
`Perhaps it's something better than the Matsuribayashi chapter...`
`You can consider this a graduating question for Higurashi - When They Cry.`
`Maybe I will leave it as my final gift to those who enjoyed this tale for four and a half years.`
`Thank you for reading this extremely complicated story.`
`In the end, what was this all for?`
`If I were to put the answer to that question in one word, it would be "entertainment".`
`It's not important if you were able to answer the riddles.`
`After all, if you enjoyed yourself, you won.`
`Ryukishi07 will continue to challenge you.`
`Higurashi - When They Cry ends here, but I hope I get to see you again in a different world.`
`What kind of work do I want to create next?`
`Maybe it's fitting to choose my next work from an infinite number of possibilities while listening to the chorus of the higurashi.`
`I want to express my gratitude to all the people who have supported me until today.`
`Thank you very much.`
`I look forward to seeing you all again soon.`
`                                    Ryukishi07`
