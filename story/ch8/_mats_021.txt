`Akasaka had received the phone signal from Irie.`
`The phone rang for over three minutes.`
`The signal told Akasaka that Irie was in some kind of an emergency, and that Akasaka himself was in danger now.`
`...Takano made a mistake.`
`She didn't realize the ring tone itself was the signal.`
`She assumed someone staying at the house would pick up the phone eventually.`
`...Her error allowed Akasaka to perceive that extremely important forewarning...!`
`Akasaka waited for exactly three minutes, then ran downstairs quickly.`
`He had already put his shoes on while listening to the phone ringing.`
`Akasaka had memorized the layout of the town from the map he'd kept near the phone.`
`He knew the shortest route to the Sonozaki residence, as well a number of alternative routes just in case the shortest was already blocked.`
`People would be surprised to see a stranger coming out of the house, but Akasaka didn't care about that at the moment.`
`He had to get to the Sonozaki residence immediately!`
`However, the observers would see him, and that was a problem.`
`They'd soon come after him.`
` Upon finding the house empty, they'd assume the man who ran from it knew something.`
`Once Akasaka left Rika's house, he had to be prepared to fight.`
` ...He relaxed his shoulders and reached for the doorknob.`
`"Major, there's a message from the unit observing the R residence!!`
` A suspicious man just exited the house."`
`"A man?`
` Who is it?!`
` Actually, I don't care, just catch him!!"`
`"Loud and clear.`
` We'll pursue and stop him!"`
`It was only ten AM.`
`It was a lively morning. Many people were getting ready for the festival.`
`Akasaka weaved through the people going in the opposite direction and ran down the stairs leading from the shrine.`
`The Mountain Dogs were already chasing after him.`
`There was a significant gulf between the happy faces on the villagers and the serious faces on Akasaka and his pursuers.`
`He could hear them coming up behind him.`
` He didn't even need to turn around to check.`
`Akasaka held his breath, focusing all of his senses to their limits as he sprinted even faster than he usually could with all his might.`
`The success rate of an escape depends on the distance between the pursuer and the pursued. Even a little distance makes a difference!!`
`Akasaka ran down to the bottom of the stairs like the wind, then headed in the opposite direction, away from the Sonozaki residence.`
`...Of course, this wasn't a mistake of his.`
` He just wanted to lose them.`
`"Shit,`
` what`
` speed...!!"`
`"Does he have wings on his feet or what...?!`
` Hah, hah!!"`
`The observers weren't ready for this chase.`
`They never expected a fast and fully-grown man to run out of the house.`
`They assumed it would be a little girl.`
` That assumption was their mistake.`
`Besides, Akasaka's locomotive-like power was nothing like that of normal people.`
` There was no way they could catch him.`
`The Mountain Dogs fell for Akasaka's trick. They called HQ, told them that he was headed in the opposite direction, and followed him that way.`
`Akasaka was confident that he could have had them completely confused if he'd had a little more time.`
`Not only that, he could have attacked them individually.`
`Were there three pursuers?`
` No, there were probably four of them.`
`...His mind, body, and skills were all in top condition, so it should be possible for him.`
`Usually overrating oneself is dangerous, but Akasaka was above such an immature level.`
`Resisting violently at a place other than his destination might prompt them to waste manpower and time.`
`But Akasaka wasn't sure of the real meaning of Irie's phone signal.`
`They were at a severe level of emergency.`
` Akasaka had no time to waste, so he had to get to the Sonozaki residence.`
`As Akasaka ran as fast as he could, he tried to think about the situation calmly.`
`Could he attack them first and then head to the Sonozaki residence?`
`The pursuers were scattered about and running out of breath.`
`It would not be easy to fight four men at the same time, but it would be different to take them one-on-one.`
`...When Akasaka decided he had a high enough chance of winning, he took a deep breath and made a U-turn around a streetlight.`
`".........What?"`
`The Mountain Dogs were surprised to see that the man who was running away from them was now running towards them. They prepared themselves to fight. `
`...But before Akasaka even reached them, he already had everything all planned out in his head.`
` He had calculated how many blows would be required to take them all out.`
`But his calculations were wrong.`
` ...Without even needing a second blow, the first pursuer dropped after one of Akasaka's legendary Armor-Piercing Punches connected with his face.`
`And while the first was still in the air, his second Armor-Piercing Punch took out the second pursuer...!!`
`There was a chorus of cicadas...`
`Which woke Irie up!`
`He needed a little time to realize what had just happened.`
`His seat belt had saved him from serious injury.`
`However, it was sheer luck that the metal parts of the seatbelt didn't get tangled and that the door didn't become warped.`
`He was on the bottom of the slope, near a different forest road.`
`Irie endured the pain and removed his seatbelt. He got out of his car soon after.`
`He heard someone walking towards him through the bushes.`
`...A pursuer...!`
` He couldn't get caught just yet...`
`If he was captured, it would be impossible to rescue Tomitake.`
`Not only that, nobody would ever know that Tomitake was captured in the basement of the clinic...!`
`Even though Irie knew he was helpless, he couldn't falter here.`
`The only thing he could do was resist them... and run for as long as he could.`
`But as soon as he started to run, Irie realized it.`
`...He had no strength. His legs were shaking and he couldn't even see straight.`
`He had only been stepping on the gas pedal, but his lungs were about to explode, and his brain was lacking in oxygen.`
`It had to be that certain type of exhaustion that came immediately after hyperarousal.`
`Irie understood that intellectually, but he still couldn't get his body moving...!`
`He tried to run, albeit in a wobbly way.`
`He heard a noise coming down the slope behind him.`
`...This was it.`
` ...But Irie still tried to run as far as he could.`
`"Security to HQ.`
` We found him.`
` He's injured.`
` We'll capture him."`
`Irie heard the voice of his pursuer.`
` ......Shit, he thought, what can I do...?`
` I have to run, I have to!!`
`"♪ Carve into your hearts the spirit of retreat! ♪"`
`"Shion-san, what's that song you've been singing?"`
`"Don't you know?`
` It's really popular nowadays!"`
`"My apologies.`
` I'm rather ignorant when it comes to pop music.`
` ......Hmm?"`
`There was a wrecked car ahead.`
`White smoke was still visible, so the accident must have just happened.`
`Kasai slowed down.`
`"What is it?`
` Oh... oh, geez!`
` Hey, isn't that the coach?"`
`Their car stopped.`
` The sound of the brakes startled Irie, and he fell on his behind.`
`Irie was obviously the one who had been in the accident.`
`"Heeey, Coach!`
` Is that your car?"`
`"...Shi... Shion-san..."`
`"Are you alright, Dr. Irie?`
` ...You should go see a doctor."`
`"We'll take the coach to the clinic so he can treat himself, huh?`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Can you stand up?`
` I'll take you there."`
`"...No,`
` not the clinic...`
` I...`
` can't...`
` go there...`
` I have to go to the Sonozaki residence...`
` oooh..."`
`"Coach?!`
` Coach!!`
` What's going on?!`
` This isn't good!"`
`Kasai looked at Irie's car, then looked around the area.`
`Then he whispered to Shion.`
`"Shion-san, he must be in some kind of trouble."`
`"...What kind?"`
`"There are bullet holes in Dr. Irie's car.`
` And they don't seem to be from an ordinary handgun."`
`"Really?`
` ...You take that end.`
` Let's get him to the main house."`
`The two of them loaded Irie into the back seat, got in the car, and left in a hurry.`
`"We have to ask the coach what's going on.`
` He can't go back to the clinic...`
` I wonder what he means..."`
`"It sounded like he was running away from someone there, but I don't know.`
` It's obvious that he was involved in something dangerous."`
`"Hey!`
` Where are you going?"`
`Shion was confused as to why Kasai suddenly made a wrong turn.`
`"...Dr. Irie's pursuers aimed for the tire of his car.`
` They wanted to capture him alive.`
` His pursuers are likely close by."`
`"Are they after us?`
` There's no car behind us, and nothing in the air.`
` In this area, we'd be impossible to follow unless they're tailing us."`
`"I'm going to make another left turn, just to be safe,`
` and then head to the main house.`
` Could you watch what happens behind us?"`
`"You got it!"`
`"...Security to HQ.`
` The target was picked up by a civilian vehicle.`
` I'm sending the license plate number and the car model."`
`"Roger that.`
` Nightingale, your target is the civilian vehicle now.`
` Search for it immediately.`
` Try to capture Director Irie alive.`
` Neutralize the civilians as well,`
` dead or alive."`
`"Are you sure? Are you going to find him?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` There's a tracking device on the Director's coat.`
` Nightingale's vehicle can catch the signal, and they can pinpoint where he is."`
`Irie was lying in the back seat, wearing his white coat.`
`...There was a device on his collar.`
` The security department put it there just in case...`
`So no matter how hard Shion tried to look for anyone following them, the enemy already knew exactly where they were.`
`"This is Nightingale 3. We've found the vehicle.`
` It just made a turn by the water mill."`
`There was a map of Hinamizawa on the table in the security room.`
`The path by the water mill led to a certain private property.`
` It belonged to the Sonozaki family, and the Sonozaki residence was the only building on it.`
`"Major...!"`
`"Hee hee hee hee...`
` Oh my, like rats in a trap."`
`"This is Phoenix 1.`
` Nightingale, don't head in yet.`
` Phoenix will join you in just a little bit.`
` We'll go in together!"`
`"This is Nightingale 1. Understood."`
`"Okonogi!`
` Don't give them any time. Why don't you let Nightingale go in?"`
`"...Zzt, zzt, bad... connection... zzt..."`
`"Huh...! Nobody listens to me...!"`
`The Sonozaki family's basement had a security system which displayed images captured from the various security cameras on the property.`
`Of course, it wasn't as high tech as the one at the Irie Institute.`
`It was in the room on the second floor of a gassho house, a Japanese-style room where you had to kneel to avoid hitting your head,`
` with bundles of wires snaking away from the monitors. It felt like a hidden chamber.`
`There was electricity and a phone nearby, and although it was in a basement, it had all of the basic amenities of the Sonozaki residence.`
`At first, all the club members had watched the monitor curiously, but after a while, it got too hot in such a tiny room.`
`Mion and Rena stayed in the room to observe the monitor.`
`"Mii-chan, look. There's a car..."`
`"That's... Kasai-san's car.`
` It's probably Shion.`
` I bet she came because the festival is today.`
` Geez, why did she have to come now?`
` I don't have time for her...!"`
`Their granny had been at the shrine since the early morning.`
` So there was nobody upstairs to answer the door.`
`And if Mion didn't answer it, Shion would think that nobody was home.`
`...Mion wondered if she should tell Shion what was going on.`
`...Shion could be helpful sometimes...`
` Hmm.`
`Kasai's car stopped in front of the gate. Someone was getting out of it.`
`"...Huh?!`
` Mii-chan, look isn't that the coach?!"`
`"What?!"`
`They saw Shion and Kasai holding Irie on the monitor.`
`Obviously something serious had happened!`
`"L-Let's move!!`
` Rena, Kei-chan, come with me!!`
`Satoko, watch the monitor!!`
` Rika-chan, don't come up.`
` Hanyuu, make sure Rika-chan doesn't move!!"`
`"Leave it to me!"`
`"I've got it!"`
`"...Meep, that's not fair."`
`...Maybe Okonogi had made the right decision...`
`If he had let Nightingale go in as Takano had ordered, it would have been on the monitor.`
`But Okonogi ordered them to standby until another unit arrived, so they waited.`
`So Mion didn't notice that the enemy was about to attack!`
`By this time, there were many vehicles belonging to the Mountain Dogs parked by the windmill. Okonogi and Phoenix 1 had joined with Nightingale, and they were getting ready to head in.`
`However, it had been a good idea to leave Satoko to watch the monitor.`
`And if Mion hadn't gone out, Irie would have been killed.`
`Mion didn't know it yet, but Irie was their only hope of rescuing Tomitake.`
`...So as a result, entirely by circumstance, they did everything correctly...`
`"Siiiiiis, Sis!!`
` Hmm, I wonder if she's gone to the shrine already..."`
`"Shiooooonnn!!"`
`"Where did you come from?`
` Ah, you were in the basement, weren't you?`
` I'll tell the hag you were playing down there!"`
`"Who cares about that?!`
` How is the coach?!`
` Coach!!"`
`"Is he alive?!"`
`"...Huh? Are you all in trouble, too?`
` What's going on?"`
`"Shii-chan, listen well!`
` It's like this...!!"`
`"Coach...!!`
` What happened...?!"`
`"...Ooh, I'm sorry...`
` The Mountain Dogs got Tomitake-san.`
` He's in the clinic's basement.`
` ...I got into an accident while they were chasing me..."`
`Irie explained everything he could while enduring the pain.`
`Everyone was happy to see him safe, but Mion's expression quickly grew stern.`
` Then she asked Shion a question.`
`"...Is anyone after you?!"`
`"Nobody was following us!"`
`"...Come on, let's go in.`
` I have a bad feeling."`
`They heard the sound of a car approaching.`
`And it wasn't alone...!`
`Who could it be at this time of the day?`
` It was a waste of precious seconds to even think that!`
`"You idiot, they ARE after you, Shion!!"`
`"I'm telling you, nobody was following us!!"`
`Kasai picked up both sisters and ran through the gate.`
`"Let's go to the basement.`
` It'll be safe there!"`
`"M-Mion-san!!`
` There are a lot of strange cars approaching!!!"`
`"I know!!`
` Go back to the basement!!`
` I'll shut the door!!`
` Where's Rika-chan?"`
`"She went into the secret room with Hanyuu-san!!"`
`"This is Nightingale 6, we've found the target.`
` Some of R's friends are there, too."`
`"......Hee hee hee!`
` R is hiding there, I know!!`
` Right,`
` Jirou-san?"`
`"............Guh."`
`Tomitake was lying on the floor of the security room.`
`His hands and legs were cuffed, and there was another pair of handcuffs to connect them, leaving him bent backwards on the floor.`
`He couldn't get up or even turn around.`
`Takano laughed and poked Tomitake's side with the toe of her shoe.`
`The Mountain Dogs climbed over the fence easily.`
` ...There was no need for anyone to explain at this point.`
`It was obvious that they were the enemy, and that they were the Mountain Dogs that Rika had spoken about many times.`
`They went through the grove of trees and headed for the entrance of the underground storehouse.`
`The first five Mountain Dogs were supposed to capture them all, but...`
` They fell down,`
` one after another.`
`Just as one of the Mountain Dogs started to wonder why they fell, he felt something on his leg. The next moment, he was flying through the air.`
`"Shiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`As he stood up, his leg got pulled again.`
`...He realized then that there was a rope wrapped around his leg!`
`Because of the way he fell, the rope was wrapped tightly around it and wouldn't come off easily.`
`"...Be, be careful!!`
` There are traps in the bushes!!"`
`Satoko had set up lots of traps in the bushes.`
`...After all, she wouldn't just sit around all day on an empty property.`
`The club members headed into the underground storehouse one after another.`
`The Mountain Dogs couldn't do anything, although they did see them!`
`"I'm closing the door!!`
` Come on, help me!!"`
`"Here we go!!!"`
`It was a heavy door, but when they put their strength together, it closed easily.`
` Mion locked the door quickly, putting on the dead bolt for good measure.`
`"...Do you think this will be enough? Don't you think they'll break this door? Don't you think?"`
`"I saw five or six, no, perhaps even more cars on the monitor!`
` They're all vans, and I saw strange men inside of them!!"`
`"I don't think this door will be broken that easily, but I'd imagine they are used to doing things like this.`
` We shouldn't underestimate them."`
`Before he could even finish speaking, someone pounded on the door.`
`The second group of Mountain Dogs had arrived.`
`Although the heavy door was separating them, it wasn't at all comforting to know that the enemy was just on the other side.`
`"...I'm sorry...`
` It's all my fault..."`
`"You haven't done anything wrong.`
` Let's go farther in!"`
`"Yeah, let's find out how many there are on the monitor!"`
`"Okay, fine, leave me out of this. I'm just an outcast."`
`"Oh, shut up!!`
` I'll explain when I have five minutes to spare!!"`
`"Nightingale 1 to Phoenix 1.`
` The targets are in the basement.`
` There's a steel door here and we can't break through!"`
`"Phoenix 1, roger that.`
` Shit, this Sonozaki family must be so rich.`
` The property is too huge for us to surround, so we won't even try.`
` Let's join Nightingale.`
` Nightingale, knock some trees down. `
`We'll use them to ram down the door."`
`"Phoenix 7 to Phoenix 1.`
` We have some plastic explosives for indoor use.`
` Do you want us to get them ready?"`
`Plastic explosives are explosives for military use.`
`There are various different kinds, but he was talking about the type specially made to break down doors.`
`Okonogi momentarily thought it was a good idea, but changed his mind right away.`
`This was a small village. If there was an explosion, everybody would hear.`
`It was daytime, and they were on the surface. It was the worst time and place for the Mountain Dogs to do their job.`
`"...An explosion isn't a good idea.`
` ......Hmm?`
` Wait a minute!`
` What time is it now?!"`
`"It's almost ten AM."`
`".........I see.`
` Phoenix 7, we'll do it. Get the fuse ready!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Commander, what does ten AM have to do with an explosion?"`
`Okonogi's mind was working sharper than ever.`
`He was sure`
` that this would work!`
`Everyone gathered in the secret room.`
`"Is everyone okay...?!!"`
`"...Au au. We were watching the monitor.`
` There are about thirty guys out there..."`
`"That many? Heh heh, that's not good!"`
`"Can I see?`
` Look, they don't know what to do!"`
`When Mion touched a switch, the screen switched to the view of the entrance to the basement.`
`Some of the Mountain Dogs were checking out the door.`
`They didn't appear to be trying to force it open. They were simply at a loss for what to do.`
`"...What do you think they'll do now?"`
`"They think we're trapped rats in here.`
` So I'm sure they're going to try breaking open the door!"`
`"What the heck? What are they doing with that log?"`
`"...They must be thinking of using it as a battering ram."`
`"...Satoko just said they're assuming we're trapped rats.`
` We should get out of here while they're trying to open the door."`
`"I agree.`
` Besides, we have to rescue Tomitake-san..."`
`"You're right.`
` No matter how strong the door is, we'll be in big trouble if they find us.`
` I think it's time for us to escape."`
`"Sis, don't you think we should call the police?"`
`"Oh, yeah.`
` We completely forgot about that!`
` Even if a spy at the police station overhears us, there really isn't much he can do at this point anyway!`
` I'm sure Ooishi-san will come right over!"`
`Mion picked up the phone.`
` ...Why hadn't she thought about this earlier?`
`"......Hmm?`
` ......What?"`
`"...What's the matter?"`
`Mion panicked as she tried to listen for a dial tone.`
`"...The phone... what's going on?`
` I don't hear anything!"`
`"......They must have cut the line."`
`"Wha?!?!"`
`Suddenly, everything went dark.`
`"......Wh-What? Is this a power failure?"`
`Kasai lit his cigarette lighter,`
` and Mion turned her emergency flashlight on.`
`"This is the drawback of a basement..."`
`"...But they won't be able to see either, right?"`
`"I know, but they might have some kind of a device that lets them see in the dark,`
` don't you think?"`
`"Mion-san, why do you think they cut the electricity?`
` Are they just going on the offensive?"`
`"......If nothing else,`
` it worked to turn the security system off!"`
`"They were checking out the door!!`
` They didn't give up.`
` They have a way to destroy the door, and they don't want us to notice it. That's why they cut the electricity!"`
`"Are they...... going to blow up the door?"`
`"The door could be destroyed in a second, so we can't stay here... right?!"`
`"Mii-chan!!!`
` Let's get out of here!`
` Show us the way to the hidden escape route!!"`
`"......This way, everyone!!"`
`Mion was getting confused amidst all the chaos.`
`...She hadn't underestimated the Mountain Dogs.`
`She even considered that they would have some explosives.`
`But she didn't think they would use them in Hinamizawa in broad daylight.`
`Somebody will hear the explosion!`
`Is there even such a thing as a silent explosive?`
`"What a rough bunch...!`
` They're not even concerned with minor risks."`
`"...This is a crazy situation... but the Mountain Dogs are always very, very careful.`
` I don't know about Takano-san, but there is no way Okonogi-san would allow an explosion in the middle of the day."`
`"Yet they're still going to do it, huh?`
` They've got guts!"`
`"I don't know much about them, but just like a silencer on a gun, aren't there, like, silent explosives?"`
`"No way!`
` No matter what you do, an explosion sounds like an explosion!"`
`"Oh, I get it!!`
` You're a staff member for the festival, aren't you, Coach?`
` What time do they let people know if the festival is going to take place?"`
`"I'm pretty sure it's at ten AM......... ah."`
`"...Au au au au!!`
` Do you think... just like on a track and field day...!!"`
`"If you want to hide a tree, hide it in the forest... huh?!"`
`Rika knew Okonogi well.`
`He would always complain about how he had to guard her like she was a princess.`
`......Rika had never expected Okonogi to be so sharp!`
` That was why she was more frustrated than anyone else.`
`The Mountain Dogs had quickly set explosives on the basement door.`
`Long wires were connected to the explosives, and the Mountain Dogs were waiting at the other end, lying flat on the ground.`
`One of the members was holding a detonation switch.`
` All the wires were linked to it.`
`"...It's almost ten."`
`"Heh heh heh, hahahaha.`
` This morning, I thought it was bad luck that this happened on the day of the Watanagashi festival,`
` but now I'm glad about it."`
`...Okonogi had realized that he could use the festival effectively.`
`He was going to make sure his enemies got what they deserved.`
`On the morning of a village event,`
` they use fireworks to let everyone know that an event is going to take place that day.`
`This method is often used for track and field days at schools.`
`...Since Watanagashi starts in the evening, the fireworks go up at ten AM.`
`...The fireworks, of course, make loud explosive noises.`
`Since Hinamizawa is located in a ravine, the sound echoes, making it hard to figure out where it's coming from.`
`...And that was an advantage for the Mountain Dogs.`
`"Now!!!"`
`A loud noise and a shock shook the ground like an earthquake.`
`The explosion must have warped support beams everywhere. There was a discomforting squeaky noise, and dust fell from the ceiling.`
`It certainly was powerful.`
`The explosion must have blown the door wide open.`
` An explosion that took place without anyone noticing it!!`
`"Come on!!`
` This way!"`
`Mion led everyone into one of the rocky caves.`
`There was a well-hidden shaft in there.`
` They called it a hidden well, but it was actually a very eerie vertical tunnel.`
`They didn't have enough flashlights for everyone, so there was no way for them to see the entirety of this ominous hidden well.`
`"...Are you telling us to go down there?`
` How far does this go?"`
`"There is a horizontal tunnel crossing it after about thirty meters.`
` We can get into the mountains through that tunnel."`
`"Okay, then why don't you go first, Sis?`
` You know the way around here better than anyone."`
`"Huh? Do I have to?"`
`"Who else?`
` Kasai and I will be the rear guard!`
` Come on, hurry up!!!"`
`"......Okay."`
`Mion was going to volunteer to take the rear.`
`But Mion and Shion knew instinctively.`
`Because there were so many of them, the rear might not make it in time.`
`Unlike the iron door at the entrance, once the enemies were inside, all they'd have to do was to go through the inner doors, which were easily breakable.`
`The route was basically a straight line.`
` They probably won't get lost on their way.`
`That's why Shion took the rear guard position before Mion did.`
`After all, she was actually the older sister.`
`Shion wanted to protect her younger sister, who was playing the older sister, in this real emergency.`
`...Mion intuitively knew what Shion was thinking.`
`...Mion understood well the relationship between her sister and herself.`
`She wasn't the only one who felt guilty for taking the older sister's position.`
`Shion felt guilty for making Mion take on the responsibility of the family head.`
`And here, finally, was a chance for Shion to atone.`
`"Mion-san.`
` Do you have the key to the armory?`
` Now is the time to open it."`
`Mion silently threw over the key.`
`Kasai and Shion took it and ran deep into the rock tunnel.`
`"Listen, everyone!`
` It's about thirty meters to the horizontal tunnel.`
` If you fall, that's it for you!!`
` It's dark, so be very careful as you go down! `
`If you end up waiting, make sure to light the way for the others, okay?`
` I think only one or two can go down at the same time.`
` I'll go first!`
` Come on, give me some light!!"`
`"...Mion-san, be careful...!`
` The ones with the flashlights, you be careful too!"`
`If the lights were on, they could have gone down quickly.`
`There were actually a few light bulbs inside of the well.`
`Of course, Mion had already checked them.`
` It was now certain that the enemy had cut the power to the basement.`
`It was extremely dangerous to go down this well with just the little light from the flashlights.`
`As one went down, there had to be people lighting up the way.`
`...Mion was right.`
`She realized as she went down herself that it was almost impossible to go down the ladder without the weak light from the flashlights.`
`The lights didn't reach all the way down.`
`In the darkness, her feet suddenly became unsteady. Every step she took made her more nervous.`
`It was about thirty meters to the horizontal tunnel.`
` That's quite deep enough already.`
`But the hidden well went deeper than that.`
` If Mion fell, she wouldn't just injure herself.`
`Has... Hasn't it been thirty meters yet, she thought.`
`She couldn't even remember exactly how long thirty meters was...`
` Had she missed the horizontal tunnel already...?`
`At that time, she felt a cool breeze on her body.`
`She could sense a huge hole nearby, so she took out a flashlight to light the surrounding area.`
`...She saw the black tunnel yawning before her!`
`"......O-Okay......`
` here I go!!`
` Hah, hah, hah!`
` OKAY!!`
` I found the tunnel!!`
` Rika-chan, come down!!"`
`Mion lit up the way from below.`
`"Okay!`
` You're next, Rika-chan!!`
` Coach, you go next, then Hanyuu, then Satoko, okay?`
` Let's move!!"`
`Irie wanted to say that he would go last, but Rena gave the order first.`
`They couldn't get into the basement of the clinic without Irie.`
` Without him, they couldn't rescue Tomitake.`
`...Their lives were all equally important, but at least for the moment, his was the second most vital after Rika!`
`"Please be careful. I'll light your way!"`
`"...Okay!`
` Come on everyone, hurry up... Ah!!"`
`"Rika!!!"`
`Rika was much shorter than Mion.`
`She couldn't go down the ladder as easily.`
` Her legs were too short, and her left foot slipped.`
`"I-I'm okay!`
` Dammit! I'm sick of this life where I never grow up...!`
` I'll pass through June of 1983!`
` And I'll grow taller!!`
` My boobs will get bigger!`
` I won't stay like this forever...!!"`
`Though she had been living for over one hundred years, Rika was still afraid of heights.`
`As she fought that fear, she tried to climb down as quickly as possible.`
`After a while, the light from the top didn't reach her anymore, and Mion's light from below lit her way.`
`Mion's light was enough.`
` The next person could come down.`
`"I'm okay!!`
` Whoever's next can go!!"`
`"Okay!`
` Coach, you're up next!!"`
`"You're a grown man, so go down quickly!!"`
`"...Right,`
` I'll go next!"`
`The Mountain Dogs moved forward carefully, wearing special goggles so they could see in the dark.`
`The one in front noticed Satoko's trap and stopped the rest of the men.`
`"Nightingale 7 to Nightingale 1.`
` I just found a wire trap.`
` Be careful coming in."`
`"Roger that!`
` Phoenix 1, there are more traps.`
` Why don't we turn the lights back on?"`
`"...Idiot, that'll only help them escape more easily.`
` They must be having problems trying to escape in this darkness.`
` We have to give them as much trouble as possible. `
`Corner them in the darkness and we'll get them.`
` ...This is a huge cave system. There must be another way out.`
` They won't try to hide, they'll try to escape.`
`Give the assault unit some firearms, bulletproof shields, and grenades.`
` The Sonozakis are basically a major yakuza family.`
` Assume they can counter us with smuggled guns. `
`...Which means watch out for those tripwires and claymores.`
` Unless you want to end up with thousands of lead pills in your body.`
` They'll shred you apart!!"`
`"Roger."`
`Satoko's traps were effective only because they were professionals.`
`Satoko had assumed any professionals would misinterpret her traps as more dangerous ones. That was why she ran wires everywhere.`
`And Satoko was right. Although the Mountain Dogs were successful at breaking down the iron door, they hadn't even reached the torture room.`
`However, the huge cave with the hidden well was just on the other side of the door to the torture room.`
`It was just a matter of time before the enemy caught them.`
`"Okay, Rena, you're next!!"`
`"Yep!`
` You come down in a hurry too, Keiichi-kun!"`
`"Kei-chan! How is it up there?"`
`"Rena is coming down right now!!`
` She's moving right along!!"`
`"Okay, don't fall!`
` The rumors say that all the people who ever opposed the Sonozaki family were dumped into this well. It's a bottomless pit!"`
`"What? Sh-Shion, what the heck are you carrying around?"`
`Shion had returned with a big machine gun in her hands.`
`Wha-What the heck, Keiichi thought. It's one of those machine guns they use in war movies!!`
`Its defining characteristic is the way the magazine is bent forward... what's it called again?`
`Kasai had one in his hands too.`
`He appeared used to handling machine guns. It almost didn't look real...`
`But it seemed like a natural fit for this surreal world lit only by flashlights.`
`Keiichi felt like the odd one out here, since he didn't know how to use a gun.`
`Shion and Kasai hid on opposite sides of the cave so they could see the entrance to the torture room.`
`...Not only Kasai, but Shion also seemed to be used to doing things like that.`
`"Sh-Shion, I'll do that.`
` So why don't you go down next?"`
`"Thank you for the manly offer, Kei-chan.`
` But it'd be much quicker if you went down swiftly than if I had to explain how this Kalashnikov works.`
`Don't worry.`
` A pretty girl like me will never die!"`
`As Shion winked at Keiichi, they heard a door being knocked down nearby.`
`Immediately, Shion and Kasai's looks turned stern, and they took cover behind the rocks, aiming their guns into the darkness.`
` The enemies had entered the torture room.`
`There was a flashlight next to the door.`
`Kasai had left it there.`
`The Mountain Dogs seemed to be able to see in the darkness, even though they couldn't.`
` So it was an improvised solution.`
`The footsteps of the Mountain Dogs were growing closer. They were passing through the torture room.`
`...In other words... the door was the only thing separating them from their enemies.`
`"Keiichi-kuuuun!!`
` Hurryyyy!!!"`
`"Shion, you go first!!"`
`"......Shion-san."`
`"If something happens to you and I live,`
` my sister will never forgive me for that.`
` I don't have my loved one anymore, but she does..."`
`"......Huh?!`
` What are you talking about, now of all times?"`
`"I don't plan to die, but please tell Shion this.`
` I want us to be twins again in the next life!!`
`Get going!!!"`
`Shion yelled, telling Keiichi to move on.`
`He didn't understand why Shion said to tell "Shion".`
`But she asked him, so he had to convey that message.`
`Otherwise`
` if something terrible really happened,`
` Shion's message would never reach Mion.`
`An explosion shook the air.`
`Something was thrown in from the torture room. The explosion from that and the noise from Kasai's machine gun sounded at the same time.`
`The clamor echoed in the cave.`
`All I can do as those violent flashes of light burn the series of images into my eyes...`
` ...is shed tears over my own intolerable powerlessness...`
`and climb down the ladder.`
` Mion quickly screamed from below.`
` I descended and screamed up to the top too.`
`"Nightingale 1!!`
` They attacked us!! The enemies are trying to stop us from the huge cave on the other side of the torture room.`
` There were two muzzle flashes, probably AKs."`
`"Whoever it is, he's a professional.`
` Phoenix 1, give us an order."`
`"Heh heh heh heh, hahahahahahahaha!!`
` There we go.`
` Our opponent is a professional.`
` Don't go in unless you graduated from the Killing House.`
` Nightingale 1 and 2, Phoenix 7 and 8, get ready to move in. `
`How many firearms do we have?"`
`"We have four MP5s and plenty of grenades.`
` We can't trust our bulletproof shields, so we abandoned them."`
`"There is a flashlight on the right next to the entrance.`
` I'm assuming they don't have a device to see in the dark."`
`"Nightingale 1 here.`
` We're going in.`
` Throw in some stun grenades when I give you the signal."`
`While the enemies were quiet, Kasai changed his magazine.`
`"Shion-san, that's enough.`
` Please go."`
`"If I go, they'll all fire at you while you reload.`
` You can't do it by yourself!"`
`There was a contradiction in what Shion just said.`
` According to her theory, the last two can never escape.`
`Mion kept shouting from the tunnel below.`
`"Damn it, Shioooon!!!`
` Hurry up and come down!!!"`
`Everyone knows it wasn't safe to stay.`
`But nobody could stop Mion from screaming.`
`"...Mion and I will wait for Shion here.`
` Rena, why don't you take everyone else and escape into the hills?"`
`"O... okay..."`
`"......No.`
` I don't want to lose anybody."`
`"Rika..."`
`"...This is the final world!!`
` There is no more starting over!!`
` I don't want either Shion or Kasai to die! I don't want a future like that!!`
` I know we can't redo it, so no, I don't want it!! `
`Shion, please come doooooooowwwwwn!!!"`
`As they looked up to the top of the well, they saw a violent flash and heard a roar.`
`Then they heard explosive sounds.`
`Different from the sounds of the machine guns that Shion and Kasai were using.`
` They also heard a tinkling sound, which could have been the sound of bullet shells.`
`They couldn't see anything other than the flashing lights.`
` Only the noise reached them.`
`When everything stopped...`
`After a little silence, footsteps that didn't belong to Shion or Kasai gathered at the top of the well.`
`They could hear hard-soled shoes kicking the bullet shells as they walked.`
`"...It's clear.`
` Nightingale 1 to Phoenix 1, we've secured the loopholes."`
`That voice echoed down the well, and Mion and the others heard it too...`
`They`
` didn't know how to react... Some became speechless,`
` some started to cry,`
` some let out a wordless scream.`
` ...They looked up the well`
` as they waited for Shion and Kasai to come down...`
` but...`
` there was no sign of them.`
`A bright beam of light shone down from the top of the well.`
`Irie grabbed Mion and Keiichi's collars and pulled them back.`
`But they could see in the dark.`
`They might already know that Keiichi and the others were hiding in that horizontal tunnel.`
`"......Roger,`
` we'll try.`
` .........Can you hear us?`
` You don't need to reply. Just listen!"`
`A guy shouted from the top of the well.`
`"We want the queen carrier, Rika Furude, and Director Kyousuke Irie!!`
` You've misunderstood something.`
` We are here to eradicate a unique local disease. `
`What's happening right now is because we suspect the Director's involvement in a conspiracy.`
` You have nothing to do with this.`
` Turn them over to us!!"`
`They had already turned all the flashlights off, so nobody could tell what kind of expressions were on each others' faces.`
` ...But I could sense Mion's expression distorting.`
`And because of the darkness, nobody knew to stop her from screaming.`
`"You murderer!!`
` You killed Shion!!!"`
`"Oh, are you talking about this girl?`
` Don't worry,`
` she's still alive.`
` She's just unconscious."`
`"...She's alive! She's alive, Mii-chan!"`
`Mion didn't rest easy at their announcement though, because she could knew Shion's survival wouldn't help resolve this situation.`
`"Same with the guy.`
` He's alive too.`
` But if you refuse to turn those two over to us, we'll have to use them both as bargaining chips."`
`"What are you going to do to them?"`
`As Mion looked up to the top of the well in the dark, it suddenly became very bright, and she saw something unbelievable.`
`Shion was unconscious, and one of the men was holding her. He was basically sticking her body out over the edge of the well.`
`If the man let go of Shion, she would fall to the bottom.`
`...They had no idea how far down it went.`
` There was no way she'd survive!`
`"Sh... Shion!!!"`
`Shion didn't reply, but she moved just a little bit.`
`Shion was alive.`
` ...At least, for the moment.`
`"...No, no way.`
` They won't push her off..."`
`"Huh?!`
` What are you saying?!`
` They can easily kill a hostage if they have more than one!!`
` They have Shion and Kasai-san.`
` He'll push Shion off and just ask the same question again!!`
` He means it!!!"`
`Mion lashed out fiercely at Keiichi.`
`He regretted saying what he just did.`
`"I'll give you a little time to think.`
` But after sixty seconds, this first hostage will go down.`
` Think it over very carefully!!"`
`"......Wh-Wh-Wh-What should we do?"`
`Mion was half-crazed with fear and panic.`
`"...They want me.`
` Let them think Rika-san has already escaped. I'll go.`
` They should be satisfied with just me."`
`That plan sounded like the best idea for minimizing damage, but... Rena quietly spoke up.`
`"......No.`
` Shii-chan and Kasai-san risked their lives to buy time so we could escape.`
` If you went back, what they did would be wasted."`
`"Then what do you suggest we do?`
` Are you saying we should let Shion die?`
` Are you saying you don't care if Shion dies, Rena?`
` Fucking damn yooooouuuuuuu!!!"`
`"Please stop, Mion-san!!!`
` I don't... I don't know what to do, either...`
` Because.... Shion-san... Shion-san is my Nee-nee...!!"`
`"Whaaaaahhh, Shion, Shionnnn!!"`
`Mion started to cry as she held Satoko's head.`
`The Mountain Dogs' beam of light shone into the horizontal tunnel.`
`Their eyes had grown used to the darkness, so even with a little light, they could sort of see one another.`
`But... so what?`
`This was a desperate situation, and Mion and Satoko continued to cry.`
`Rena bit her lower lip, trying to hold her feelings in.`
`Irie simply looked down.`
`...And as for Rika and Hanyuu... they were restless.`
`"............What do we do, Hanyuu...?`
` I don't know what to do..."`
`"...I don't know either."`
`"Hey, you're a god, aren't you?`
` Do something... do something...!!`
` Use your psychic powers to knock the enemies down!! Help Shion!!`
` Only a miracle can save her!!`
` You're a god! Make a miracle happen!!!"`
`Slap.`
`They all heard a strange sound.`
` ...Everyone was surprised to see what caused it.`
` Hanyuu just slapped Rika in the face.`
`"Rika.`
` Listen to me."`
`"............Hanyuu...?"`
`"We both have experienced many worlds, and we have learned much.`
` Sometimes you learned, and sometimes I learned. `
`We've learned so many important things, and now, in this world, we've learned the most important thing.`
` Something we've been pursuing, something we finally got.`
` Do you know what that is?"`
`"........."`
`...It was how to make a miracle happen.`
`A miracle is like a number you get on a die.`
`People think that the result of the roll depends on God's mood.`
`God holds the key to miracles.`
` Humans don't have the right to control them.`
`But, although humans don't have the right, they can perceive.`
`They can perceive how to improve their odds, and how they can make a miracle happen.`
`".........How to make a miracle happen..."`
`"Rika.`
` You should already know.`
` You learned it before I did.`
` ...This world must be precious to you. ...Why don't you try it, this one last time?"`
`".........Ah......"`
`Rika's mouth hung open.`
`...That's right, she thought.`
` ...I had forgotten again... how to make a miracle happen.`
`"......You all go ahead and escape."`
`Rika stood up.`
` Everyone was surprised to hear what she said.`
`"Irie, take them.`
` I'll go out there.`
` Takano means to kill us both,`
` but she wants to kill me in a certain way.`
` So she won't kill me for a while."`
`"A-Are you kidding? You'll end up dead anyway!!"`
`"If I don't go, Shii and Kasai will be killed.`
` I'll let them capture me. The time it will take Takano to kill me will give you a chance to counterattack."`
`"...Ri......... Rika-chan..."`
`"Thinking about it now, the answer was very simple."`
`As she spoke, Rika stepped out of the horizontal tunnel and reached the ladder.`
` ...The beam of light shone down upon her.`
`In this dark world... her figure... seemed almost holy, like someone receiving a divine revelation.`
`"Because...`
` we all believe we can win.`
` You, me and even God believe in it. This is nothing.`
` Nipah~☆."`
`Rika's smile told them`
` that she trusted them`
` 100%.`
`She believed someone would come rescue her before she got killed.`
`That was why she didn't mind letting the enemy capture her.`
`If it would save Shion and Kasai's lives,`
` then it was nothing.`
`"......I'm coming up right now.`
` Pull Shion back, okay?"`
`The Mountain Dogs pulled Shion's body away from the edge of the well.`
`"If you even think of touching my friends,`
` I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.`
` ...Takano wants to kill me personally, so if that happens, you'll be in big trouble, okay?"`
`".........Alright, alright.`
` Come on up."`
`"Let all of my friends go.`
` According to your plan, they'll all die anyway."`
`"...No, we can't do that.`
` We won't kill them, but we have to restrain them."`
`"Well that's a pity. Farewell.`
` It'll be faster to let go of this ladder than to bite my tongue.`
` This is a very deep well.`
` If you can't produce my corpse, then that ruins your plans too, doesn't it?"`
`".................."`
`As long as they captured Rika, the Mountain Dogs didn't really care about the others.`
`They were ready to kill the rest if they resisted once they had Rika.`
`That's why they wouldn't agree to Rika's request.`
`They started to think that maybe they should just lie to Rika...`
`But that was when they heard something.`
`...Hanyuu started to speak in a clear voice.`
` ...It was a voice with a very mysterious tone.`
`It sounded like it was coming from below the surface of the Earth, but it also sounded like it was coming from Heaven.`
`Hanyuu spoke.`
`"...I am saying I accept the deal.`
` Quit complaining and do as she says, lowlifes."`
`"...............!"`
`"Rika Furude is coming up.`
` You will fulfill her little request.`
` Heaven will not provide to those who won't offer anything themselves.`
` Stop thinking above yourselves, humans. `
`Know your place, and the sin of pretending to be more."`
`"..............."`
`Nightingale 1, the member who had been demanding their surrender, was suddenly overcome by a strange sensation.`
`...He had been in such an advantageous position,`
` but somehow, it didn't seem that way anymore...?!`
`And that girl's voice...... there was something strange about it.`
`...That voice belonged to something both holy and sacred. He instinctively sensed it.`
`.........Humans can only negotiate with other humans.`
` ...It's impossible to negotiate with a being greater than all humans...`
`"W......... Wait...`
` I'll check with the commander.`
` Wait a minute.`
` ...N-Nightingale 1 to Phoenix 1..."`
`He had been very threatening until just a minute previous, but he had grown completely perplexed.`
`...Everyone was stunned by Rika and Hanyuu's mysterious auras.`
`"We......`
` will come rescue you...`
` right away, okay......?"`
`Rena muttered as she tried to hold back her tears.`
`"...Okay, we'll accept your request.`
` We'll let everyone else go.`
` Rika Furude, you come up.`
` Major Takano says there's something she wants to talk to you about."`
`"Okay, I'm coming up.`
`Nipah~☆."`
`"Have we ever been looking for you, Rika-san.`
` You're such an important person, so you can't just disappear like that, you know...`
` That's against the rules."`
`"...Meep."`
`"Rika-san, we'll take you back to the clinic.`
` Everyone else is free to go."`
`The assault unit that led Rika away headed back into the basement.`
`...They were about to break the rules, too.`
`"...You... aren't going to keep that promise, are you?"`
`"A promise?`
` What are you talking about?`
` Heh heh heh heh heh heh."`
`"...............Tch."`
`"Whoa there!!`
` We don't want you to bite your tongue.`
` ...Hey!!"`
`As Rika tried to run, Okonogi grabbed her fragile arm.`
`She fought back, but her resistance meant nothing against him.`
`One of the Mountain Dogs took out a syringe from a case.`
`It shouldn't kill her, but it would probably put Rika to sleep.`
`Takano, after all, didn't need a chatty Rika. She just needed a live queen carrier.`
`...If Rika got that shot,`
` that will mean...`
` the end...`
` of this world.`
`"Mm, mmmmm!!!"`
`Before Rika could scream, the other Dog covered her mouth.`
`"Mmmmmm!!!`
` Mmmmm!!!"`
`"Hurry up and give her the shot."`
`The Dog with the syringe drew closer to Rika's arm.`
`Rika was being grabbed from behind, and her mouth was covered. There was no way for her to fight.`
`...I believe.`
` ...Even if I'm asleep...`
` I believe...`
`Rika kept repeating that in her mind. She believed that someone would wake her up.`
`...And that the first thing she'd see when she opened her eyes would be her beloved friends...!!!`
`"...............?"`
`...It happened all of a sudden.`
`The man with the syringe spun twice in the air and dropped to the ground.`
`Nobody... including Okonogi, could understand this sudden phenomenon. It defied the very laws of physics.`
` ...Rika couldn't understand either.`
`The man who was holding Rika from behind spoke up...`
`His voice had such a heavy feeling imbued in it.`
`"...I regretted it in countless worlds.`
` ...Whenever I realized it, it was too late..."`
`"Wh...`
` who...`
` who are you...?"`
`The others took a few steps back, away from Rika and the man holding her...`
`There are many units within the Mountain Dogs, so often its members don't remember each other's faces.`
`There were just too many units, so nobody really paid attention.`
`All of the Mountain Dogs were more or less well-built.`
`...But this man had an excellent physique.`
`Even Okonogi noticed that he'd never seen anyone like that in one of his units before.`
`Rather, he actually wanted to recruit him...`
` ...But...`
` But...`
`"...This is`
` what I've been longing to tell you all this time."`
`"...A...`
` ........A..."`
`"Akasaka!!!"`
`The hands that were holding Rika left her shoulders.`
`...They left ever so gently.`
`""Damn yoooou!!!""`
`...And as soon as they did, they transformed into a pair of furious fists, which implanted themselves in the faces of the men attacking him from behind.`
`They flew through the air!!`
`Akasaka hit those two without even turning around!`
`"......Hm!!!"`
`Five members of the Mountain Dogs surrounded Akasaka.`
` However, he didn't even see them.`
` He could only feel the deep emotion of finally being able to do what he had been longing to.`
`...And the five of them sensed it.`
`...That maybe...`
` just maybe...`
` he didn't even care that they were there...`
`"Wh... What are you doing just standing there?`
`Get him!!"`
`On Okonogi's signal, the five Mountain Dogs bore down on Akasaka.`
`"Rika-chan, stay low."`
`"Okay...!"`
`Rika dropped to the ground......... and Akasaka was left standing.`
`...Akasaka, who came back to keep a promise he made with a girl five years ago.`
`But his promise was worth more than five years.`
`...Rika knew that.`
` ...Akasaka probably understood it too.`
`The promise went back one hundred years.`
`For one hundred years...`
`He regretted not being able to save her from the conspiracy.`
` He believed that one day, there would be a miracle, and he could travel back to this day. That was why he continued to train himself.`
`His strong will and Rika's wish made that miracle happen!!`
`That one and only miracle allowed Akasaka to be here in Hinamizawa in June 1983!!!`
`The first one went down in the time it took Okonogi to blink.`
` Lowering himself to grapple Akasaka had proven fatal.`
` He wasn't so soft as to let such perfect openings go by!!`
`Akasaka's hand smashed into the back of the man's head. His blow was powerful enough to smash a pillar of ice or shatter a mountain of tiles. `
`...As it happened, Akasaka was holding back a little, so that his target wasn't too injured.`
`Akasaka's well-trained fists continued to knock down the Mountain Dogs, one member for every time Okonogi blinked.`
` ...One hit per opponent was all Akasaka needed.`
` This was the true essence of karate!!`
`Akasaka's colleagues praised and feared his power.`
`Weapons were useless against him.`
`No matter how hard his victim tried to protect himself, it meant nothing to Akasaka.`
`...But he was too strong for the Mountain Dogs to even understand that!!!`
`It was as if he was a giant they had to crane their necks up to see.`
` Akasaka didn't even give them time to think!!`
`Someone from the Mountain Dogs must have called for backup.`
` About a dozen more members had arrived!`
`"...Don't worry,`
` Rika-chan.`
` As long as I'm here, I won't let them touch you!!"`
`"...Meep~☆. I'll draw some pictures while I wait, then."`
`As Rika stayed low to the ground, she picked up a stick and started to carve into the dirt.`
`That made Okonogi even angrier, but he calmed himself down.`
`Then... the warrior's intuition resting in Okonogi's blood came to a realization.`
`Numbers didn't matter.`
` Even the full force of the Mountain Dogs wouldn't be able to defeat this monster.`
`...All the combat units were still down in the basement.`
` There was no way they could take him.`
`"......Heh heh heh heh heh, hahahahahahahaha.`
` Okay, I guess I have to take you down, huh?`
`By the way, I remember you now.`
` Your face brings back memories.`
` Boy, you've sure grown, huh?"`
`"...............You...`
` ...It can't be......"`
`"Heh heh heh heh.`
` You don't recognize me?`
` It sure has been a while, huh?`
` You've grown a hell of a lot!!`
` Good to see you again!"`
`It had been five years.`
`...This was the man Akasaka fought when he was investigating the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson.`
` ...Akasaka had still been inexperienced then...!`
`"I was ordered to go easy on you, so I held back.`
` But I won't hold back today.`
` Heh heh heh, and that fat guy won't come help you either!"`
`"..............."`
`"Still... you sure have improved a lot in the past five years, huh?`
` I'm happy.`
` ...I've been hoping for something like this for five long years!`
` The rest of you, you stay out of this. He's mine!!!"`
`Okonogi took off all of his equipment and threw it on the ground. He loosened one button, and then positioned himself.`
`Seeing that, Akasaka realized he was somewhat capable, and narrowed his eyes in vigilance.`
`Okonogi took that as an insult.`
`...That Akasaka only thought he was...`
` "somewhat capable".`
`His behavior was telling Okonogi that he viewed him on the same level as the other small fry.`
`Akasaka first moved to take up his stance and avoid getting Rika involved.`
`...Akasaka hadn't even moved one bit until just then.`
`Okonogi could easily see that Akasaka was extremely strong.`
`But at the same time, he thought he would be fairly simple to take down.`
`Karate may be a martial art, but nowadays it was just a sport.`
`The army combat Okonogi trained in was completely different!`
`Obviously Akasaka had studied a lot, but it's all just child's play.`
` All he learned were routine moves and forms.`
`Besides, karate moves are fairly straightforward.`
` Okonogi was confident that he could fight any karate pro and win.`
`Okonogi started leaning onto his toes and using his meticulous footwork.`
`In contrast, Akasaka still hadn't moved from his back stance.`
`...Akasaka was acting as if Okonogi's footwork was simply a trick,`
` which infuriated Okonogi!`
`Okonogi moved fiercely and nimbly, in a manner completely different from how Akasaka was moving earlier!!`
`Akasaka remained calm.`
` But Okonogi saw it differently!`
`He can't react to my movements, so he's prepared to take damage in order to deal more!!`
`"Wooooooohhhhhhh!!!"`
`Akasaka couldn't defend himself from Okonogi's quick jab, and it connected with his face.`
`It was a quick but light attack. Its purpose was to distract Akasaka and create an opening for Okonogi.`
`Okonogi knew that Akasaka would use his arms to guard his face instinctively!`
` Okonogi's real purpose was to attack his abdomen, which would then be unguarded!!!`
`Of course, Akasaka didn't have enough time to guard himself.`
` It took more than just good kinetic vision to prevent his attack.`
` Only Okonogi, who trained for many years, had perfected the speed of that technique!!`
`Normal people would struggle helplessly while vomiting if they were to experience Okonogi's kick.`
` It could even rupture internal organs!!`
` So it was pretty amazing that Akasaka was still on his feet.`
`"Heh heh heh heh heh heh!!`
` What's the matter, Mr. Karate?`
` Can't you fight back?"`
`"...What?"`
`Akasaka mumbled something, but Okonogi couldn't hear.`
`...Actually, he did hear it.`
`...But Okonogi never imagined...`
` he could say such a thing in this situation...`
` so he couldn't hear it.`
` He couldn't comprehend it.`
`"Wh... What did you just say?"`
`"...Your attack is only meant to defeat your opponent.`
` That's why there's no weight to it."`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"Karate nourishes you spiritually.`
` To attack others, you have to learn to be attacked.`
` When one learns how much pain and grief their own blow deals to others, `
`...they finally understand the meaning of striking another and being struck.`
` You aren't even close to that level, and that's why your attack has no weight to it."`
`"Are you saying... that I'm still immature?!!"`
`Okonogi attacked Akasaka again, but this time, Akasaka was different!!`
` Akasaka blocked Okonogi's fists and legs!!`
` Of course, Okonogi was still the only one attacking. `
`But Akasaka had started to become much more aggressive.`
` Now, as Okonogi attacked, his hands and legs were being injured!!`
`Okonogi instinctively sensed that he was in trouble.`
`...He'd thought Akasaka was just a police officer.`
` But his movements were too dangerous.`
` He was merciless. He was dangerous!`
` So Akasaka's training and experience must far surpass Okonogi's!!`
`Wait... that dynamic heel kick isn't karate, is it?!`
` Akasaka's heel kick missed Okonogi's head by a millimeter.`
`"Y... you, you do something other than karate, don't you?"`
`"No.`
` I only do karate."`
`"Don't lie!`
` Some of the moves you're doing aren't karate at alll!!"`
`Okonogi was starting to become impatient...`
`The reason Okonogi ridiculed martial arts as sports was because they were all hard-headed and only used set moves.`
`This is how you strike in karate.`
` This is how you punch in boxing.`
` This is how you throw in judo.`
`It's easy to learn, and that's why it's easy to win!`
`But Akasaka was different.`
` He said that he only did karate, and he must have spent unthinkable hours training.`
` Yet, he was flexible enough not to be confined only by formatted moves.`
`That was understanding at a spiritual level.`
`The spirit of martial arts isn't just forms.`
`One simply learns forms to reach that spiritual level.`
`......Therefore, for one who has reached it, there are no forms.`
` What Akasaka had was a philosophical spirit!!`
`"......I'm disappointed in you."`
`"...Sh... Shiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Akasaka stepped away from his original spot for the first time.`
` He moved forward.`
` He filled the space between Okonogi and himself with his inescapable conviction!`
`As Akasaka walked closer to Okonogi, Akasaka's assault radius tried to swallow him whole.`
`To be within that radius meant "death"!!`
`Okonogi walked backwards to avoid being in that radius.`
`That was as the result of his clear-headed judgment...`
` Not because he was scared...!`
`"You don't even know the meaning of an attack... I'll teach you just how significant it can be!!"`
`"Ooh...!!`
` ...?"`
`As Okonogi moved backwards, his back hit the van he came in earlier.`
` He was cornered!!`
`Having your back to a wall didn't mean you were at a disadvantage, but the more it was pressed against that wall, the further a disadvantage it became...`
`If Okonogi let Akasaka come any closer, Okonogi wouldn't even be able to take a combat stance!!`
`Okonogi decided it immediately.`
` The last chance he had was the moment before Akasaka took his next step!!`
`Akasaka's foot`
` left the ground.`
` He was taking another step....!!!`
` NOW!!`
`"GO TO HEEEEEELL!!"`
`No tricks, no feints. Okonogi lowered himself and attacked with everything he had!!`
`The attack was powerful enough to break Akasaka's ribcage and rupture his heart!!!`
`I'm a professional, Okonogi told himself!!`
` I can't be be defeated by this amateur!!`
`At that moment, Akasaka's eyes opened wide!!!`
`"Woooooohhhhhhh!!!"`
`All the Mountain Dogs heard a noise.`
`...It wasn't the noise of people fighting.`
` ...It was...`
` the noise of a traffic accident!!`
`Okonogi's blow`
` missed by a slight amount, and Akasaka's fist struck inches away from Okonogi's face.`
`There was a dent in the sliding door of the van.`
` The windows on both sides had shattered, and it looked like the van was in an accident.`
` ......Was it even possible`
` for a human fist to do this?!!`
`Time resumed its flow, and Okonogi knelt down, falling to the ground!`
`Akasaka didn't miss on purpose.`
`Akasaka couldn't control his fist because he put everything into one blow.`
`...Okonogi should thank Akasaka.`
`If Akasaka had been able to control his attack better, Okonogi's face would have ended up like the van!!!`
`However, although it didn't hit Okonogi's face, it shattered his spirit.`
`"...Good job, Akasaka~. Clap clap clap clap!"`
`Rika applauded.`
`But in this situation, it didn't sound like applause.`
` It almost sounded like Akasaka's fighting spirit was popping like firecrackers.`
`Akasaka pulled back his fist, turned around calmly, and then spoke.`
`"...Who's next?`
` I don't want to waste time, so why don't you come at me all at once?"`
`""".........Ah!!!!"""`
`They knew.`
`Everyone knew...`
` that there was no way to defeat Akasaka with their bare hands!!`
`They realized they needed weapons!!`
` They also needed more people. There should be a better equipped unit in the basement!!`
`All of a sudden, things began to move quickly.`
`The remaining Mountain Dogs emerged from the basement.`
`"You are not permitted to fire on the surface, I repeat, do not fire on the surface!!`
` Phoenix 1, give us permission to collect R and retreat immediately!!"`
`But the Mountain Dogs who just witnessed Akasaka's battle against Okonogi realized it was time for them to run. They didn't even care about Rika.`
`Who would even think of taking Rika from him after seeing what Akasaka was capable of doing?`
`When Okonogi regained his awareness, he jumped into a van with the Mountain Dogs as it drove away.`
`Since Okonogi took off his intercom device to fight with Akasaka, he had no idea what had transpired in the basement.`
`After the Mountain Dogs broke their promise with Rika, they were supposed to round up the remaining club members.`
`But when Akasaka showed up, the Dogs had to be divided into a ground force and a basement force, which altered the situation.`
`Kasai had gone on a counterattack,`
` and the other club members somehow climbed up from the well and helped him.`
`Since the Mountain Dogs weren't allowed to fire on the surface, they realized it would make the situation worse if Kasai fired his guns once he came up after them.`
`Okonogi was unreachable, so Nightingale 1 had ordered the retreat in his place.`
`...Who would bear the responsbility for this? It was probably Okonogi's fault for taking off his intercom device to fight against Akasaka, as he basically abandoned his job as a commander.`
`But everything happened in the first place because Akasaka showed up.`
` So maybe it was his triumph, rather than Okonogi's blunder.`
` Either way, everything was miraculous...`
`But the Mountain Dogs hadn't run with their tails between their legs.`
`They had simply retreated for the moment.`
`When they returned, they would have enough men and enough arms, ready to kill all who stand in their way.`
`And that would happen very soon.`
` There was no time to waste.`
`"...Rika,`
` I'm glad you're safe."`
`"......Yeah, I am.`
` Thanks to a miracle."`
`"No, it wasn't a miracle.`
` We worked together and one of us, Akasaka, came to help you, that's all.`
` Au au."`
`"......That's true.`
` Something like this can't be called a miracle."`
`"Okay, now it's our turn to attack!"`
`In the basement, the club members were talking about their grand counterattack.`
`Rika was a little disappointed that she couldn't have joined them,`
` but she was happy that Akasaka told her what she had been waiting to hear.`
`Rika told them about how heroic he had been, and he got a little embarrassed.`
`Kasai was doing alright, but Shion wasn't doing too well.`
`Of course, it wasn't life-threatening, but she couldn't hear well in her left ear, possibly due to being so close to an explosion.`
`To test her hearing, Mion went around to Shion's left side and whispered some dirty words. She seemed to be able to hear them fairly well.`
`...Of course, she might have been hearing through her right ear, though.`
`Shion decided to lie down on a tatami mattress in the torture room while Irie kept an eye on her.`
`Mion was very worried, but Shion told her that she was okay, and forced her to go ahead with the next operation.`
`Mion complained that Shion didn't understand her feelings.`
`Now they would have to come up with an idea to rescue Tomitake from the clinic.`
`They had Akasaka and Kasai on their side, both of whom were used to battles.`
`Also, they had Irie, who knew about the secret basement of the clinic.`
`They would have to get moving quickly, but they had to at least have a plan.`
`It was almost ten-thirty AM.`
`Because of what they had gone through, they were exhausted, and it felt like it was almost evening...`
` But if they were at school, it would be only the second or the third period.`
`They had to pull themselves together!`
` They had to regain their fighting spirit!!`
`Irie checked Shion's left ear with a penlight.`
`"I'm not a specialist, but your ear drum may have been damaged...`
` Do you have a headache or feel dizzy at all?"`
`"No,`
` I'll be just fine!"`
`Irie wet his handkerchief and wiped Shion's face gently.`
`"...Are you surprised?`
` That the manager of the Hinamizawa Fighters was in a gunfight, I mean."`
`"......Yeah, I am.`
` ...I heard you were ready to give up your own life.`
` ...Maebara-san told me."`
`"...Geez.`
` Things like that sound cool in the moment, but when you survive, they're pretty embarrassing, huh? Ahaha, man!"`
`'If something happens to you and I live,`
` my sister will never forgive me for that.`
` I don't have my loved one anymore, but Sis does...'`
`"I don't mean to tease you...`
` But,`
` you're talking about Satoshi-kun, aren't you?"`
`".........Well, I dunno.`
` ...Who knows where he could be?`
` ...I don't even know if he's alive or dead."`
`"He's alive."`
`"......Eh?"`
`Shion's thoughts stopped in their tracks when Irie answered immediately.`
`"Satoshi Houjou-kun is alive.`
` He developed terminal symptoms`
` due to excessive stress last year."`
`Mion and the other club members had already told Shion about the current situation,`
` so she kind of understood what he meant.`
`"I thought I could treat him with the same drug I used on Satoko-chan.`
` ...But Satoko-chan was one of the very rare and lucky cases. Satoshi-kun's treatment has been very difficult.`
` ...It's`
` still going on."`
`".........Satoshi-kun.`
` He is...`
` still`
` alive..."`
`"I'm sorry for not telling you this until now.`
` Satoshi-kun is in the basement of the clinic."`
`Shion and Irie returned from the torture room.`
`Shion looked very serious.`
` As if she had gained the determination to fight...`
`Keiichi and the others were just talking about how the enemy found where they were.`
`"......Do you think there might be some kind of device on Dr. Irie's clothes?`
` Not his personal clothes, but something the clinic provides."`
`"Do you mean... my coat?"`
`"Excuse me, let me check."`
`Shion checked Irie over like an inspector at an airport.`
`Then she found a little button on the backside of his collar.`
`It was a little round button.`
` There was no reason why a button like this would be on the back of the collar.`
`"This is probably it.`
` This is how they found us without following the car."`
`"...Damn it.`
` But as long as we have this button, it's possible for us to create a diversion, right?"`
`"A decoy unit with this button can lure the enemy away, and while the clinic is short on staff, we attack and rescue Tomitake-san.`
` I think that's the best way."`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` In that case, the decoy unit should bring our foes to my hills!"`
`"Yeah, that area would be perfect!`
` It's pretty vast,`
` so the enemy will have to bring lots of men,`
` rendering the clinic practically empty!"`
`"But we'll have no way of knowing how many will stay behind at the clinic.`
` Mr. Tomitake is there,`
` so they'll probably leave an appropriate number of men to guard him."`
`"...In that case, we should add something they want more than Tomitake to the decoy unit.`
` Are you sure, Rika?"`
`"Yes.`
` As long as I'm with everyone else in Satoko's hills, I won't be caught."`
`"Only we club members know the hill well enough.`
` ...So maybe it's a good idea to use us as the decoy unit."`
`"Yeah, that works.`
` So the adult unit will attack the clinic while the decoy unit lures the enemy away.`
` What's the chance of success?"`
`"As long as Akasaka-san pretends not to see anything...`
` since I heard you're a policeman."`
`Kasai spoke while loading his shotgun.`
`"I'm off duty now."`
`Akasaka replied while checking an automatic pistol.`
`...He hadn't used this particular gun before, but he was used to handling guns.`
` He was prepared to fire, too.`
`Irie tried to memorize how to remove the safety, but he looked nervous.`
`"Have you ever used a machine gun before?"`
`"No,`
` I've only ever used handguns."`
`"Then maybe you should get used to it.`
` Make sure you have a full magazine at all times,`
` and have another gun just in case the magazine gets stuck."`
`"Kasai-san...`
` is that a shotgun?"`
`"The odd number shots are slug bullets.`
` They can suppress enemies as well as destroy walls."`
`"Wow, I know people call you 'Shotgun Tatsu', but you really are a shotgun expert, huh?"`
`"Shotguns are very deadly.`
` Therefore, even without firing a shot, my opponents may surrender.`
` By the way, I have some bulletproof vests. You should wear them."`
`Kasai sounded very dependable, but at the same time, he reminded everyone that this operation would be a very dangerous one.`
`It wasn't a simple fist fight.`
`Even a veteran soldier can die in a gun battle.`
`There is always a chance of death, regardless of how well-trained you are.`
`In fact, Kasai and Akasaka were the only people who could be depended upon.`
`Kasai talked Irie out of carrying a gun because it might be dangerous for him to have one.`
`Someone could get injured by friendly fire.`
`Mion suggested that maybe there should be more people on the team, but both Kasai and Akasaka refused because those who couldn't even handle guns at all might end up as dead weight.`
`"Well, then I have to go, huh?`
` We lack firepower.`
` I'll bring my Ingram to support you."`
`"But are you okay, Shion? How's your ear?"`
`"Oh,`
` it's all better now.`
` I'm back to normal. Sorry to make you worry."`
`"......Shion.`
` What did I just say?"`
`"Eh?`
`......Ah,`
` ahahahaha,`
` of course`
` I heard it, ahahahaha!"`
`...Mion had tricked her.`
` Mion didn't say anything.`
`Shion still couldn't hear out of her left ear.`
`".........Shion, it's too dangerous!`
` To be honest with you, you shouldn't even be in the decoy unit.`
` You should just hide somewhere!"`
`"...Sis, listen.`
` I now have a reason why I have to go to the clinic.`
` ...But... if I mention it, Satoko is going to want to come too.`
` ...But she just can't. `
`There will be an indoor fight. The enemy will fire at us."`
`"Do you mean..."`
`Mion sensed it.`
` She sensed the reason why Shion had to go to the clinic.`
`That was why she didn't say anything more.`
`If she was in Shion's position,`
` she would go even if neither of her ears could hear.`
`"I-It's too dangerous, Shion-san!`
` Please think it over!!"`
`"Satoko!`
` Shion will join the rescue unit. Satoko, the decoy unit is counting on you.`
` Concentrate on your job!"`
`"Shii-chan..."`
`"...You know, right, Rena-san?`
` You know I'm not planning to die!"`
`"Yeah.`
` I do.`
` ...Determined girls can never die."`
`"That's right!`
` Even if they kill me, I won't die!"`
`Shion and Rena gave each other a high-five.`
`"Okay, then it's decided.`
` Let's get moving."`
`"...Shii.`
` I'll take the button."`
`"Here you are.`
` Good luck, Rika-chama."`
`"You too, Shii.`
` You believed strongly in a miracle, and now it's going to happen.`
` Therefore, this is a chance that God has given you."`
`".........I think there were days I didn't believe.`
` I think someone even admonished me for that.`
` .........It is difficult to keep believing, isn't it?"`
`"But you believed.`
` You regretted not believing, so you believed.`
` So please cherish this day.`
` Your strong will brought about today, and you will no longer have to suffer what you have been suffering up until now."`
`"......Hey, are you my Sis' new friend?`
` I don't know your name, but thank you.`
` Yeah, I think it'll go well."`
`"...Of course it'll go well.`
` Oyashiro-sama guarantees it."`
`"Hahahahahahahaha!"`
