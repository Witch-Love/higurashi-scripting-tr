`The forecast said there was a chance of rain in the evening...`
` but I didn't think it would rain so hard.`
`We decided to wait at an abandoned bus stop for the rain clouds to clear.`
`"...I'm sorry, Takano-san."`
`"Oh, don't be, Jirou-san.`
` I knew it would pour, so don't worry about it.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`Takano-san giggled.`
`Although she said the weather might change suddenly, I dragged her out here.`
`...I feel stupid for making her come along and ending up ruining her precious day off.`
`I have to go back to Tokyo tonight, so it'll be a while before I can return to Hinamizawa.`
`I didn't want to spend my last day at a cheap hotel in Okinomiya, so I asked her to go for a stroll.`
`"It's just... hahaha...`
` I'm really sorry."`
`"Hee hee hee hee."`
`She teased me for a while, but only a little.`
`She wasn't actually enjoying driving me into a corner.`
`That's just her way of communicating, and I find it very charming.`
`...I think... I've become captivated by her.`
`But on her part, I'm just an auditor from Tokyo.`
`...That's why she's being nice to me, and it's definitely not because she likes me personally.`
`......So I feel like I might have used my position to drag her out here, and that makes me a little depressed.`
`I probably should think this slight fever I have is due to nothing more than a cold.`
`But she was the type of person who made it clear when she disliked something.`
`...She wouldn't say so directly, but she would use all kinds of indirect expressions that meant the same thing.`
`...So I want to believe she's out here because she might be even a little bit attracted to me.`
`"...Haahh."`
`I shook my head as I frowned upon my selfish thoughts.`
`She chuckled as though she knew what I was thinking.`
`I felt myself starting to go red after that.`
`"You're a mysterious person, Jirou-san.`
` I bet women don't leave you alone, huh? So why are you hanging out with a weirdo like me?"`
`"A weirdo? No way!`
` You're fascinating, Takano-san!`
` Actually, I feel bad making you spend a day with someone like me!"`
`"Of course, I've decided to devote my life to my work, but...`
` Life is too dry with only that.`
` I need to switch gears once in awhile.`
` Besides, communicating with the opposite sex is good for the brain.`
` Hee hee."`
`"Ahahahahaha...`
` It's all good if I managed to help you clear your head..."`
`"Don't you feel refreshed just being with me...?"`
`She gives me an impish smile that makes my heart skip a beat.`
`I tried hiding my embarrassment so she wouldn't notice even my ears going red.`
`"Of course...!`
` When I'm with you, ah... you know, I do feel refreshed, yeah!`
` Besides, if you learn about avian photography, I'll gain a buddy to share my hobby with. `
`S-So, next time, I'll bring my old camera.`
` It's really expensive to buy a new one, you know? Ha ha ha."`
`"Thank you.`
` I would love to learn about the avian photography that you're so intrigued by.`
` I'm looking forward to joining you on a stroll next time you go.`
` So I don't need to buy a camera, do I?"`
`"N-N-No!`
` Try with my old camera first, and if you enjoy it, then you can buy one for yourself.`
` I'll send it to you when I get back to Tokyo!"`
`"Thank you.`
` Then I'll have you critique my photos when you come next time."`
`"S-Sure!`
` Hahaha, I can hardly wait to see them!"`
`"Hee hee.`
` They'd be nothing compared to yours.`
` It'd be my very first time doing it, you know."`
`While she keeps her cool and smiles, all I can do is blush and scratch my head.`
`...Am I being conceited?`
`I can't help but think that Takano-san likes being with me.`
`...If it's mere flattery, I don't think she'd come along this far.`
`......Oh, no, no, no.`
`Taking women's flattery seriously is the mistake I always make.`
`I shouldn't assume that she's attracted to me.`
`"......By the way, isn't this the first time we've been alone like this?"`
`"Ah, yeah, you're right.`
` Usually, the director or some other research staff is around."`
`"I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't know exactly what you do in Tokyo, or what you've done in the past.`
` I wonder what you do in the Self Defense Force?"`
`"Aha, ahahahaha...`
` I was an instructor for a while.`
` But I was injured, and hurt my eye.`
` I can live life normally, but they made a big deal out of it, and ever since, all I do is desk work.`
` Ahahaha..."`
`Takano-san giggles, saying I must have done something silly to cause the injury.`
`"And when I helped PR with their magazine, I became fascinated by photography! `
`Cameras have the power to make people happy.`
` Ahahahaha, I bet you don't know what I'm talking about, but it's true!`
` Since I started to take pictures, my life has been a lot happier."`
`"......How can a camera make someone happy?"`
`"Well,`
` a camera takes a snapshot of a moment of life.`
` Of course, you want to capture a moment that's filled with happiness, right?`
` So you look for happiness through the viewfinder. `
`And as you search, you realize your everyday life is actually filled with happiness.`
`For example, a dandelion sprouting from the crack of the asphalt is just a weed in a busy life,`
` but when you look at it through the viewfinder, it's a gift to let you know that spring is approaching. `
`You capture it and put it in an album`
` and every time you open the album you remember the happy feeling you had when you took the picture."`
`"So you always feel that way when you take your pictures?"`
`"Sure.`
` I don't have ambitions of taking artistic photos or capturing a dramatic, prize-winning moment. That's not important to me. `
`I want those moments we don't notice,`
` and helping us recognize those little moments of happiness is the greatest thing about cameras to me.`
` So I'm really glad to be able to see Hinamizawa through my viewfinder."`
`"............Hmm..."`
`I have a tendency to go overboard when I talk, but most of the time, Takano-san playfully twists my words right back at me.`
`So it's very unusual for her to listen to me like this.`
`Takano-san sat down next to me and tried to fiddle with my camera.`
`I don't know how much of an impression I made, but I think she is indeed interested in cameras.`
`I was expecting her to tease me like usual, so I'm happy to see that this is her reaction.`
`"Do you want to try?"`
`"...Do you think I can?"`
`"It's easy!!`
` First, you just need to learn how to focus and press the shutter.`
` Why don't you hold it?`
` Oh, don't ever touch the lens though."`
`"Whew,`
` this isn't easy.`
` ...Hee hee."`
`Since she seemed to show an interest in cameras, I wanted to take a walk around Hinamizawa and take some pictures of the scenery.`
`But unfortunately, the rain doesn't seem to want to stop.`
`But she was still having fun, and kept taking pictures inside the bus stop.`
`So the first set of pictures she ever took were of odd things in that dark little building.`
`Since then, `
`every time we'd meet, we ended up walking around the village with our cameras in our hands.`
