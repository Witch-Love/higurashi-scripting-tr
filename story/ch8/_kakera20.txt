`"Maybe we should wrap up for now.`
` I don't think you're in the mood today."`
`"Eh?`
` ...That's not true.`
` Sorry if I gave you that impression."`
`Takano-san has been looking through the viewfinder, but I haven't seen her push the shutter at all.`
`While she came along, I don't think she's in the mood for bird watching.`
`Takano-san has been depressed ever since the announcement of the new policies at the board meeting the other day.`
`That's understandable.`
` The Irie Institute was created by her in the first place.`
`It was created so that she can devote her life to researching Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`For all that to be tossed aside while being asked to wrap up work within a few years... of course she's depressed.`
`Besides, she can't even fully spend the rest of the time left on research.`
`Their funding was being cut in stages, and by the end, they'll barely be able to finish closing up, let alone research anything.`
`...I heard that she's the granddaughter of the late Dr. Takano.`
`Her determination to finish her grandfather's research is what kept her going until today.`
`Since everything has been going so smoothly until recently, this sudden change in the wind's direction must have been a total shock.`
`The shift in people pulling the strings must be pretty serious.`
`The board of directors was completely changed out, and she heard that people and projects influenced by the Koizumi faction were being restructured to set an example.`
`The wind's new direction seems likely to remain for a long time.`
`It's highly unlikely that the Koizumi faction will come back into power. So no matter what we say, it's almost impossible to expect the same kind of support from them.`
`"...Isn't there something we can do?"`
`Takano-san muttered.`
`Unfortunately... there isn't.`
` There is nothing anybody can do.`
`"......At first, the board talked about halting the research immediately.`
` ...But after lots of convincing, they finally agreed to make it a gradual suspension over a few years. `
`The people who helped us when the Irie Institute was first created are the ones who managed that."`
`"...Hee hee.`
` ...I see.`
` While it looks like the worst-case scenario, it's actually somebody else's hard-earned victory, huh?"`
`"Three years was the best they could do.`
` I tried too, you know.`
` I used your data to try and explain to the board how important this research is..."`
`"Only...... three more years, huh?"`
`Maybe Takano-san doesn't understand how hard I tried to convince them.`
`Because what she just said tells me the length of time left really doesn't matter to her. The important thing is that her research is being stopped.`
`The fact is that I couldn't meet her expectations and made her feel disappointed...`
` As a man, it kind of hurts.`
`"The best I can do at this point is route as much funding as possible towards the research so that you can work to your heart's content for the few years we have left.`
` Sorry...`
` I can't do anything else..."`
`"That's okay.`
` If that's the best you can do, then I'm very happy."`
`Her words hurt me.`
`I wish she'd chosen different ones, but I think that would be asking too much from someone so heartbroken.`
`I must be understanding of her pain at a time like this.`
`Besides, I know how close she was to the deceased Koizumi-sensei. She even called him 'Uncle'.`
`To her, his death is not just the start of a coup, or a change in direction.`
`She lost a person who was always looking after her.`
`No matter how hard she pushed herself to act villainous...`
` ...she wasn't supposed to be part of this world.`
` ...She was just an ordinary woman.`
`But she was intrigued by Hinamizawa Syndrome, and she had to find help from someone who had more power than her to be able to continue research on it.`
`...The dark side of the world, the world she should never have gotten involved in, extended its hands out to her.`
`She was left all by herself in that world, and she's still trying to put on a brave face.`
`I'm sure Takano-san thinks I'm unreliable.`
`Realistically, I'm not the kind of person who can meet her expectations.`
` Nor do I have the power to.`
`The least I can do for her... is stay sincere and remain her ally until the very end.`
`Since she had so much room to act... it's harder for her to determine what actions to take when she's cornered.`
`I wanted to believe she wouldn't, but I'm concerned that she might do something drastic eventually.`
`I hope I can be of help to her in that very final moment before she makes her move.`
`But I can't even gain enough trust from her to do that... How pitiful and pathetic.`
`Of course, part of it is... as a man, I want her to rely on me.`
`But that's not really it.`
` She's been abandoned in this world and is all alone, so someone has to be her ally.`
`And if I'm the only one who knows about that,`
` then being her ally is my job.`
`I know her too well, so I know that she'll never ask for help.`
`Even if she says it's unnecessary, someone has to be with her. I know that.`
`I don't really think I'm suited for that job.`
`I'm sure that there are many reliable people out there who are more appropriate for the position than me.`
`But I can't let her be alone until that person appears.`
`"Takano-san,`
` I know I'm pathetic and unreliable..."`
`"Hm?`
` What's this all of a sudden?`
` What is it, Jirou-san?"`
`"But I think I can be of help to you.`
` So..."`
`"Thank you.`
` But I don't believe that talking to people helps you feel better.`
` Sorry.`
` Though I'm happy to hear that you're concerned. I really am."`
`"...O-Okay.`
` That's fine.`
` I'll always be on your side. Please believe that, okay?"`
`"Of course I will.`
` If you think of a good idea to convince the board, please let me know, okay?"`
`"Sure...`
` I'll do my best."`
`Why is it?`
`I know she's such a strong person and there's nothing someone like me can do for her.`
`But...... somehow, I feel she needs help and support right now.`
`She looks as tough as ever, `
`but only I, who has been taking pictures of her all this time, can tell.`
`A viewfinder, after all, is also a window to look into someone's heart.`
`...But if I say something like that, she'll tease me again, so I won't.`
`Anyway,`
` ...I never thought she needed support more strongly than I do right now...`
