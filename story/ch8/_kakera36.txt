`"Th... This is the school?`
` Yeesh, this really is the sticks!"`
`"Keiichi, don't say stuff like that.`
` The people in this area love coming here."`
`That was my first impression of the Hinamizawa Branch School.`
`No matter how I look at it, it doesn't look like a school at all.`
` It even has a sign that says "Hinamizawa Forestry Service"...`
`"Wa ha ha ha ha!`
` You're right!`
` We're borrowing the building from the forestry service!!"`
`Said the man they called the principal as he laughed heartily.`
`"Although it doesn't look like it, it is in fact, a school.`
` The rules may be a little different from the one you went to previously, though. Are you okay with that?"`
`"Ah...yes!"`
`I heard all the grades are put in the same classroom at this school. I didn't believe it, but I think it really is true.`
`They're all younger than I am, so I guess it'll be like kindergarten.`
`...Though it'll be interesting compared to my previous school where everyone looked the same age!`
`"If you transfer here, you will be the oldest boy in the class.`
` So you'll have to be a good role model for the younger students.`
` The younger students have the tendency to copy bad habits from the older ones. `
`I'll be keeping my eyes on you too, so make sure you're aware of that, okay?"`
`"I-I understand.`
` I'll do my best."`
`"Keiichi,`
` what she means is that textbooks aren't the only things you learn from.`
` As a member of the class and also as an older student, you have to be a good example."`
`"I know that already...!"`
`After that, Chie-sensei brought us to an empty classroom and showed me where my desk would be.`
`Since we're all still growing, I'm sure our sizes are very different.`
`There are some desks that are way too small for me to even put my legs under, and also some that are just perfect for me.`
`There are approximately thirty desks in here.`
`But since all the different grades are in the same room, I'm sure it's very lively.`
`There's also a wall full of calligraphy and art from different grades.`
`It's all pretty exciting. Nothing like my previous school.`
`...It reminds me of the days when I truly enjoyed my school life.`
`"Dad,`
` I like it here.`
` I like this school better than the other one in the town."`
`"I think my son likes it here.`
` I want him to go to this school too."`
`"I see.`
` The school in Okinomiya has more resources and better teachers, though..."`
`Even while saying that, Chie-sensei looked happy to hear that a new student would be transferring into her class.`
`My father and the teachers went back to the teacher's office to get the transfer process going.`
`In the meantime, I decided to stay in the classroom and look around.`
`...I didn't care about the move.`
`I'd lost the will to live because of what I did.`
`I didn't have any willpower, and I couldn't even get out of bed.`
`So when my parents told me about the move,`
` ...I thought that wouldn't change anything.`
`But after the move, something did change.`
`I want to restart my life.`
` I want to restart my life and become someone I've always wanted to be.`
`Here in Hinamizawa and at this school, I can do that.`
`I'm not going back to who I was.`
`I'll never again think that good grades are the most important thing in this world.`
`I have a feeling that I can learn the things that are really important in life here at this school.`
` I never had the chance to learn them before now.`
`It's almost embarrassing to put into words,`
`but they're extremely valuable things,`
` and if you don't learn them, you won't become a decent adult.`
`The students at this school learned them a long time ago. To them, they're a given.`
` Yet, I have to spend time learning about them even at this age.`
`How to make friends.`
`How to play with friends.`
`To play.`
` Things you can only learn from play.`
`Things like socializing with others.`
` Etc.`
` Etc.`
`It seems so easy.`
` But it'll take me a while to learn them.`
`I pushed those things aside and devoted myself to studying.`
`I'm not trying to say studying isn't important. But you shouldn't become blinded by it.`
`If someone says studying and good grades are the most important things in life, he's talking bullshit!`
`...So I can restart my life here at this school.`
`Finally, I can become someone I've always wanted to be.`
`"........."`
`I noticed two girls looking in at me through the window.`
`The schoolyard must also be a playground for these children, because I saw a lot of them playing there earlier.`
` I guess those two noticed me walking around the classroom and became curious.`
`I guess that's natural.`
` I'm a stranger to them.`
`Should I say hello and let them know that I'm starting school next Monday?`
`"......Finally.`
` We've been waiting for so long."`
`"Au au au.`
` This will change things.`
` Because Keiichi is the six on the die."`
`"......Yes, he is, but his die rolls a one far too often."`
`"Au au au... that's not Keiichi's fault though."`
`"......It's all your fault, Hanyuu.`
` It's because of you.`
` Apologize to Keiichi."`
`"Au au au au au..."`
`"Eh?`
` Do you know my name?"`
`She said my name, didn't she?`
` ...Did I hear her wrong?`
` I've never met her before.`
`"Nipah~☆.`
` Are you a new student?"`
`"Eh?`
` Ah... ah!`
` Nice to meet you!`
` I'm Keiichi Maebara.`
` I'm starting next Monday.`
` Take care of me, okay?"`
`"Au au au☆.`
` Sure thing!"`
`"......Here is a message for you, Keiichi, from the shrine maiden of the Furude Shrine.`
` On your first day, be careful when you come through the door to the classroom. `
`Also, there'll be a thumbtack on the back of your chair. There'll be a toy frog in your desk too."`
`"...But even with this warning, you fall for it again and again.`
` Your Monday is going to be disastrous... poor Keiichi."`
`"Hee hee.`
` That's why it's fun.`
` Why don't you try overcoming that fate sometime?`
` Hee hee hee.`
` You'll be the one to teach us that.`
` In one of the many worlds, right?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Huh?????"`
`I'll be reminded of the prophecy made by the two girls next Monday, because of the actions of a snaggletoothed girl.`
`...I'll realize it too late, though.`
`But I like it here.`
`My name is Keiichi Maebara.`
`This is my new beginning, and this time, I'm going to enjoy it to the fullest!`
`I've been missing out on so much but, I'm going to learn all of those things here.`
` I'm going to absorb all of it!`
`And I'll become someone I've always wanted to become.`
`It may take a very long time.`
`But I'll definitely do it!`
