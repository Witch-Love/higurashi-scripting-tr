`I thought about telling Keiichi to give the doll to Mion...`
` but I stayed quiet because I wanted to believe in him...`
`When we were in the same situation in a previous life, Keiichi gave the doll to Rena.`
`Mion was deeply hurt by that, and the tragedy began shortly after that...`
`If I didn't do anything and just watched him now, things were going to end up the same way.`
`But...`
` I'm sure that Keiichi deeply regretted the fact that he didn't give the doll to Mion in that previous world...`
`And while I was aware he didn't have any memories from that world...`
` I was hoping that his heart vaguely remembered that strong emotion...`
`I challenged him...`
` without telling him anything...`
`Keiichi is contemplating whether he should give the doll to Mion or Rena...`
` He finally opens his mouth...`
`"Mion, if you think I would look like a pervert with this doll, who do you think deserves to have it?`
` Huh?"`
`"I-I don't know...`
` All I'm saying is that dolls aren't for boys."`
`"I see... Then I guess you can have it.`
` Here."`
`Keiichi tossed the doll to Mion as if passing her a basketball.`
`As if forcing to her to carry his bag, or something.`
`Mion's face quickly turned red.`
`Feeling shy, Keiichi turned away from her.`
`That was amazing...`
`Keiichi just made a miracle happen again...`
` He did it without any memory of his previous life!`
`It was exactly the same situation as in the previous world,`
` but he made a totally different decision...`
`"...........Keiichi............"`
`"Rika... this might just be a coincidence, you know?"`
`A strong will is directly related to fate.`
`If his will to give the doll to Rena was weak, this might have been a result of that.`
`But I don't feel it was just a coincidence.`
`I believe that Keiichi remembers something in his heart, and because of that, he made some progress...`
