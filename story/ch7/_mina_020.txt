`Satoko and Rika-chan were already there waiting for me.`
`While the injuries on her face (covered with band-aids) looked painful, Satoko seemed to be full of life.`
` It almost looked as though her wounds were from playing too hard or something.`
`"So you stayed at the clinic last night?"`
`"Yes. I told him I was fine, but the coach wanted to keep an eye on me."`
`"If that's what the doctor said, then you should listen to him."`
`"Ahahahaha, I see!`
` You were scared to stay at the clinic alone, weren't you?`
` I heard there are lots of ghosts inside hospitals!"`
`"......Satoko can't sleep without me."`
`"Hauuu!`
` Why can't you sleep without her? Why?"`
`"That's because...`
` Rika-chama is the only one who can give her comfort..."`
`No sooner had Shion finished that sentence than a bucket went flying into her face.`
`Satoko started chasing Shion in circles, like they were playing tag.`
`I really missed this rambunctious fun.`
`"I thought I'd never see this again."`
`"...I felt the same.`
` But we got it back.`
` We did this."`
`"......I think you did the most.`
` It was your idea to go to the child consultation center, and you were the one who asked everyone for their support."`
`"I agree.`
` I think Kei-chan contributed the most.`
` Most people in Hinamizawa know who Keiichi Maebara is by now!"`
`"Hau.`
` Is Keiichi-kun going to be a popular guy now? Is he?"`
`"I bet he'll be incredibly popular!`
` Popular among old ladies, that is.`
` Ah, I really envy him!"`
`I'd be fine with that if I could divide their ages by three...`
`Many people were wearing yukatas.`
`It was still June, but it felt more like it was the middle of summer.`
`Once we finished climbing the stairs,`
` we could see the festival and the crowd enjoying it.`
`The Furude Shrine was packed with people, leaving the grounds looking nothing like their usual, quiet self.`
`Lanterns of various colors were hung about, and people were swarming the various festival booths, giving the whole place an unorganized yet pleasant atmosphere.`
`"What a crowd!!`
` I had no idea there were even this many people in Hinamizawa..."`
`"Everyone comes to this festival.`
` I think at least half of the population of the village is here."`
`"There's more than just them.`
` The neighboring town councils and youth groups are invited too."`
`"I see.`
` We only have a few students in our school.`
` That explains why there are so many kids around today."`
`"Hearing the happy cheers of children is the best part of the festival."`
`She's right.`
` I'm in agreement there.`
`There were lots of booths around too; they were by far the best part of the festival.`
`Booths selling takoyaki, yakisoba, shaved ice, apricot candy, sauce senbei, chocolate bananas...`
` There was a yo-yo game, a goldfish game, a shooting gallery... There were countless booths here.`
`"Those booth runners all came from the city.`
` You can't call it a festival without festival booths!"`
`"So we're going to have a battle in every one of them, huh?`
` I'm not going to lose today!"`
`"Yeah, same here.`
`...Heh heh... let's do it!"`
`"Y'ello!!`
` Sorry I'm late.`
` Am I the last one?`
` Everyone's here now, huh?"`
`"Once our club gets together, there's no way we can just sit back and enjoy the festival!"`
`"Of course not!!`
`We're doing it again this year!!`
` This Watanagashi festival, for this six of us...`
`Will be the battle of six evils!!"`
`"......Satoko.`
` There's no reason to hold back this year. Let's enjoy the festival with all our might."`
`"Oh ho ho!!`
` You don't even need to mention it!`
` I, too, declare that I will be the victor!!"`
`"Yeah, Satoko!`
` You go, girl!"`
`"Let's put everything that happened before tonight behind us!"`
`"Let's play with everything we've got!`
` It's been a good week since we all got together!"`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` Tonight we're all enjoying this festival to its fullest!!"`
`"My, hello. You all seem to be enjoying yourselves."`
`"Hi, Rika-chan.`
` I'm here like I promised.`
` The festival sure has grown into a splendor."`
`"Who's this guy?`
` You know him, Rika?"`
`"......Akasaka is never there when I need him."`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about?`
` Did I do something to make you upset...?"`
`"Na ha ha ha.`
` While you were at the hot springs with your wife, things sure got hectic around here."`
`"Hau, Rika-chan is talking with some strange older guy.`
` I wonder if he's someone she knows. I wonder!"`
`"Who is he? Who is he?!`
`Introduce him to this ol' man, too!"`
`"Hey!`
` Maebara boy!!`
` I heard what you did!"`
`"I heard about it too!`
` I heard you fought Oryou-san with a sword until she finally gave in!`
` Good on you!"`
`"I-I-I didn't do that...!`
` We just had a peaceful negotiation...!"`
`"Still, I'm proud of you!`
` You led everyone and actually negotiated with the center!"`
`"Hey you, I'll give you some apricot candy!`
` How many do you want?"`
`"Wow Keiichi-kun!`
` You're so popular today!"`
`"...I'm sure Keiichi is into old ladies, too."`
`"I don't know what Rika's trying to say, and I don't even want to know..."`
`"Oh, that's the guy who helped us yesterday...!`
` Thank you so very much for your assistance!"`
`"Oh, I should've introduced him to you then.`
` This is my uncle Saburou, who's in the prefectural assembly.`
` This is my other uncle Ken, and he's in the city council."`
`"Sorry that we were late yesterday!`
` We got lost on our way there. Gah ha ha ha ha!"`
`"No, no, you both were a great help!`
` I was really impressed to see the power of elected officials!"`
`"Well, we're chosen to fight in place of the citizens!`
` Of course we're strong!"`
`"We're glad Satoko-chan is safe.`
` Talk to us again if there's anything you need.`
` We'll be glad to help!"`
`They rubbed Satoko's head while they spoke.`
`"Th... Thank you very much..."`
`"You must be proud of your son!"`
`"Oh, no, it's not really a big deal...!`
` Hey, Keiichi!`
` We're here too!"`
`"Keiichi-kun's parents are here!`
`Good evening!"`
`"Nice to meet you.`
` I'm Keiichi's meow meow, Rika."`
`"Nice to meet you.`
` My name is Satoko Houjou."`
`"So you're Satoko-chan.`
` Such a poor little girl... look at her face!"`
`"You can make use of Keiichi if anything happens again!`
` In return... what would you think about modeling for me....?!"`
`"Y-Your father reminds me a bit of the coach..."`
`"Sorry...`
` That's just the kind of person he is..."`
`"Still, he seems very nice and fun to be around...!"`
`"......This is the best Watanagashi festival I've ever had."`
`"Yes...`
` I feel the same way...`
` You've been around a lot longer than me.`
` If it's your best one, then it must be mine too."`
`"...Au au.`
` Still, I think this is most fun and exciting festival we've had since it became known as Watanagashi."`
`"The Watanagashi festival only became like this just a few years ago, didn't it?`
` It used to be just a boring traditional ceremony that the Furude family held. `
`And before that, it used to be something different, more like the things that Takano is interested in..."`
`"......Au au au."`
`"Sorry...`
` I'll try not to be mean to you today.`
` Let's go have fun.`
` The both of us.`
` It's a special night for both me and you."`
