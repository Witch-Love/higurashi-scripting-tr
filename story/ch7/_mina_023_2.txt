`Irie had already heard about the deaths of Tomitake and Takano.`
`It seemed like both the clinic and the office in Tokyo had flown into a panic over it.`
`...It's funny how they make such a big fuss about their own people when they don't care about what happens to other people's lives if it would get in the way of their research.`
`Takano's subordinate, Okonogi, was in the room.`
`Okonogi is the leader of the Mountain Dogs.`
`I came here to make sure he's still willing to protect me.`
`Based on past experience, they tend to lose interest in protecting me after Takano dies.`
`"......Okonogi.`
` Takano is dead, but am I still safe...?"`
`"Don't worry Rika-san.`
` We'll still keep up the tight security around you.`
` You don't have to call the police."`
`...I guess this is part of that tight security?`
`They must have been listening to my conversation with Ooishi.`
`"......Ooishi told me something.`
` Is it true that Takano isn't really dead?"`
`"That can't be true.`
` The Gifu police department made an official announcement.`
` That Ooishi is retiring this year, isn't he? Sometimes he makes up stories because he's desperate to solve the curse of Oyashiro-sama. `
`You shouldn't pay attention to anything he says."`
`...Well, he's not wrong.`
`This year is Ooishi's last chance.`
`Because he's so desperate, he's developed a bad habit of listening to every rumor he hears.`
`"......What's your opinion about this, Okonogi?"`
`"Right now, they're still investigating, so I can't say anything.`
` Knowing the relationship between those two... I think it's clear that this was done by someone within the organization."`
`I glanced over at Irie as I listened to Okonogi speak.`
`...It seemed that whoever he was talking to over the phone was accusing him of killing them. Irie was frantically trying to prove his innocence.`
`Soon enough, he hung up the phone.`
`Irie looked upset that he was under suspicion after working so hard for the organization.`
`"Oh, Rika-chan.`
` I'm sorry for making you wait."`
`"......It seems like you're in big trouble."`
`"Just as you heard.`
` ...It sounds like there's some big conspiracy behind their deaths.`
` People in Tokyo think that I'm the one who's pulling the strings. `
`...Good grief, I have a lot of questions as to how they figure that!"`
`I rarely ever saw Irie get so emotional.`
`He must be feeling as though all his effort is being repaid with injustice.`
`However, it's a fact that Irie was trying to fight against the budget cuts and downsizing of his research team.`
`Tokyo is thinking that could be his motive for killing them.`
`...In any case, everyone in the organization is suspicious.`
`"I understand how scared you must feel.`
` The people who attacked Takano-san and Tomitake-san could be after you, too...`
` The people in Tokyo are also concerned about that."`
`"We got the order to tighten up your security.`
` Don't worry."`
`"...I'm very relieved to hear that,"`
`This was the first time the Mountain Dogs had ever tightened up my security.`
`They usually become so busy keeping tabs on Irie after Tomitake and Takano's deaths that they end up ignoring me.`
`Even though they're dead, I'm still in a pretty favorable situation.`
`"...So do you have any idea who killed them?"`
`"People in Tokyo are investigating that now.`
` Based on the situation, it's clear that this was done by someone within the organization.`
` ...Ha ha ha ha, I guess I'm their prime suspect."`
`"...You're the only one who could kill Tomitake like that."`
`"Th-That's not true.`
` The people in Tokyo are discussing the possible use of H173.`
` But that drug was destroyed when the research was cancelled.`
` It's impossible...!"`
`"However...`
` They have no choice but to suspect you in this case.`
` Mr. Tomitake even took a vaccine before he came here.`
` But he still got infected."`
`"It must just be an extremely unlikely coincidence...`
` Anyway, it's just impossible...!"`
`...Irie is usually a very calm person...`
`but once the people in Tokyo start suspecting him, he often loses his mind.`
`"......Do you think Takano might be the culprit?`
` She's someone within the organization."`
`"Takano-san....?`
` N-No way..."`
`But as he spoke, Irie also started to realize that everything could be explained if Takano was the culprit.`
`......But I don't know how to persuade him that it's the truth.`
`More than anything, people want to hear a motive.`
`Not who did something, but why.`
`...Knowing that probably isn't as important as it sounds.`
`After all, you never know the motive unless the suspect talks.`
`Guessing about the motive is just a waste of time.`
`In other words, it's stupid to assume that Takano isn't the culprit just because I don't know what her motive is.`
`"Rika-san, you can't say something like that without any proof...`
` She was very nice to you.`
` How can you suspect her after that?"`
`Upon hearing me be ungrateful towards his boss, Okonogi flashed me an unpleasant smile.`
`"..........."`
`It's true that Takano was very nice to me.`
`It might be disrespectful of me to suspect her.`
`However... I still can't trust her completely yet.`
`Perhaps I've developed the same bad habit as Ooishi.`
`Am I believing every crazy theory I hear just because I'm desperate to escape from my fate...?`
`"In any case, something bad is going on around here.`
` We all need to be careful."`
`"Don't worry.`
` We've received an order to tighten up your security too..."`
`Irie smiled bitterly.`
` ...For him, their protection wouldn't be too different from stalking.`
`"Rika-san, make sure that you don't give up too much information to the police.`
` I think you understand, but you could create a problem if you talked to them about our secrets."`
`He was implying that he'd have to kill anyone I talked to.`
`...This isn't the first time they've warned me about this.`
`It's just......`
` what if Takano really is the culprit...?`
`If she is, then Okonogi is almost certainly involved too.`
`...Then it'd make sense that he wouldn't want me to suspect Takano.`
`But that would be horrifying.`
`If Takano was my enemy,`
` then the Mountain Dogs were too.`
` ...This whole clinic is a lion's den.`
`Irie is just a researcher, so he probably wouldn't know what's really going on.`
`The more I thought about it, the more confused I got.`
`Why would Takano do something like this?`
`I thought I'd just convinced myself that the motive shouldn't even matter, but I can't stop thinking about it...`
`Is Takano really behind it all?`
`Am I going as crazy as Ooishi just because of how badly I want to solve this mystery?`
`Perhaps...`
` the Mountain Dogs are more like`
` wolves looking after a flock of sheep.`
`I've lived for over a hundred years.`
`I never once found out who killed me, and I stayed close to the Irie Institute so that they'd protect me.`
`...What if that was my big mistake...?`
`......Well...`
` I'm sure that Irie has no bad intentions.`
`In many lives, I got to see just how genuine his feelings are.`
`I can trust him.`
`...However, he's not really reliable.`
`Okonogi glanced over at me.`
`He smiled and told me not to worry, but I noticed an evil glint in his eyes.`
`......It's possible that I have Hinamizawa Syndrome, and that was just a hallucination.`
`I don't understand anything.`
`I don't even know who my enemies are anymore.`
`...There's no point in thinking about this any longer.`
`I have to only trust who I know I can trust for sure.`
`There are only a few of those people, though.`
`...`
`...`
` Irie,`
` Ooishi...`
` and my friends.`
`If Okonogi is on Takano's side, he will be watching me very closely.`
`If I started accusing Takano of anything, who knows what they'd do to me.`
`.........When this world first began, I thought I had no time left.`
`...But that wasn't true.`
`...The number of things that happened in just two weeks was immense.`
`I probably only have a few more days left until the day of my death.`
`What can I do?`
`How can I change this?`
`Am I supposed to just take Hanyuu's advice and resign this time?`
