`"What?`
` I-I know I've heard some people mention it before, but... they were serious about that?!"`
`...This world always has a lot of nice suggestions, but they're mostly out of politeness, right?`
`They're just something you laugh off and reply with, "That would be nice."`
`But those ideas generally end as jokes, so it's crazy when they turn real!!`
`"Yeah, I'm serious!`
` Uncle Yoshirou was giving you a ton of praise too!`
` He said it was amazing how well that Pop-up Pirate game went in the toy store yesterday!"`
`"I had no idea, no idea you could play that game like that!"`
`"I should mention that some of the kids around my table wanted to play with you too!"`
`"......Keiichi is a genius when it comes to playing games."`
`You know, I wasn't just playing around... I was giving it my all, because I had no choice but to win...`
`I guess we made it look like a lot of fun for the audience, though...`
`"You definitely have a blast no matter what club activity you're doing, Kei-chan.`
` The Coach was saying that the Hinamizawa Fighters would be so happy if you joined the team."`
`"That's very true.`
` Dr. Irie had nothing but great things to say about you at the meeting last night, Maebara-kun."`
`"You have the ability to bring people joy, and far more than you think you do."`
`"...You, you think so...?"`
`"This ol' man didn't mention your name just 'cause you're his friend.`
` He did it because he's confident you can do the job!"`
`"I was there at the meeting too, and no one was against the idea."`
`"Maebara-kun, you honestly do have a good reputation around the village."`
`"I've heard good things about you in Okinomiya too.`
` What you did in the match between the Hinamizawa Fighters and the Okinomiya Titans was legendary."`
`"It really was incredible...`
` The reporters were there to see Kameda-san, but they were more impressed by you!"`
`They're talking about that rigged baseball match I set up with Kameda-kun...`
`The public did end up believing that talented pitcher walked me out of fear for my insight...`
`Kameda-kun and I have entered a strange relationship since then, but I'd really rather not talk about it right now...`
`"What do you think, Keiichi-kun?`
` I think you can do it.`
` I'm backing you up, too!`
` I definitely think you should be in charge of the Watanagashi planning committee!"`
`Watanagashi is an annual village festival held in June.`
`It's supposed to be the biggest event in the village, and most of the people living here gather together for it.`
`Since this is a major event, they always organize a committee to plan out the festival a few months in advance.`
`The festival is only two weeks away and I just moved to this village,`
` but now they want me to join that committee?`
`"Look, first of all,`
` I don't even know what you do in a committee!"`
`"You don't need to be too concerned about it!`
`The job we unanimously want you to fill is... hosting the auction!"`
`"Wha... what the hell is that?`
` Do you want me to sell bananas or something?"`
`"Well, let me explain.`
` We're holding an auction event for the first time this year. We're going to auction off donated items, just to see how it turns out."`
`"Ahaha, there's kind of a long story behind it...`
` We wanted to do something in which everyone can participate, using donated items as prizes. `
`But the elder members decided to distribute the prizes using something other than a lottery, for their own reasons."`
`"To put it simply, our hag of a grandmother let her temper get to her and wouldn't back down after that.`
` But she didn't really consider any specifics..."`
`"Yup... ahahaha...`
` Anyway, we had to come up with how to utilize those donated items.`
` At that point, we thought of doing an auction!"`
`"That sounds like fun!`
` You might be able to get something good for a really cheap price.`
` It's fun just to watch the show, too!"`
`"The items were all donated, so they were free, huh.`
` That committee sure is good at making money."`
`"......The profit will be going into the beer fund for the village committee's winter getaway trip.`
` It's not fair."`
`"You're not ready for beer yet, Furude-san!"`
`"I think I understand what's going on now...`
` But still, I've never done anything like it before!"`
`"I'm sure you can do it, Keiichi-kun.`
` I bet you'd do really well if they told you that you'd get to keep ten percent of the profits."`
`"Well, yeah...`
` If I can gain something for producing results, then I'll do my best at it!"`
`"On the other hand, you might be facing a dreadful penalty game if you don't produce anything."`
`"Wait a minute, Satoko!`
` Why would I agree to a risky deal like that?`
` Don't forget, they're the ones asking for my help!`
` I'm a very busy guy, you know!`
` Try asking my agent first."`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
`All right, Kei-chan.`
` If you want some kind of compensation, we can talk about it.`
` I really want you to be a part of this.`
` We can make a deal!"`
`"Hmmm!`
` That sounds interesting...`
` I wonder what I should ask for...`
` Hmm........"`
`"We're always talking about punishments, but it's our first time talking about a reward."`
`"That's true.`
` We're always fighting for something, huh?"`
`Rena is right.`
`The whole purpose of our club activities is to escape the punishments we come up with.`
`Even if we win, we never get a prize or reward for it.`
`"......Keiichi has no idea how to respond to something that sounds too good to be true."`
`"Maybe Mii-chan can come up with a good idea.`
` It's hard to decide on what you want, isn't it?"`
`"Let me see...`
` Ah, how about this?`
`An admission ticket to Angel Mort's Dessert Fiesta!"`
`"Don't be too cheap, Sis. Why don't you give him three years' worth of admission?"`
`"Hey!`
` That sounds more like a deluxe reward to me!"`
`"I heard that some people pay lots of money for that ticket.`
` Are you sure you can hook me up with three years' worth of admission?"`
`"Of course I can!`
` But you have to do a good job!"`
`"I'm sure he will.`
` With Keiichi-kun there, it's going to be heaps of fun!"`
`"I feel the same way.`
` I'm really looking forward to the auction now."`
`"Yeah, you could probably get people to line up for takoyaki that doesn't even contain octopus!"`
`"Hey... Takoyaki without octopus? That's impossible..."`
`"No, no... I'm pretty sure you could do it!"`
`"Yeah!`
` He'd probably say it was a healthier kind of takoyaki!"`
`"Are you making fun of me, or what...?"`
`"So what do you think, Maebara-kun?`
` I think you'll do a wonderful job."`
`Chie-sensei was also on the committee.`
`She must have backed up Mion's suggestion when she brought my name up at their last meeting.`
`"......I'd also love to see what kind of magic you can do.`
` Nipah~â˜†"`
`"A good auction always depends on how good a speaker the host is."`
`"Sounds like it's going to be Keiichi Maebara's big show!`
` It'll be so much fun just to watch!"`
`"Hey, I haven't accepted the offer yet!"`
`"Don't worry, Keiichi-kun. You can do it!"`
`"You're saying that because you don't have to!"`
`"Hau, that's not true!"`
`The principal suddenly opened his mouth.`
`"Maebara-kun...`
` In my opinion, you will do a fine job."`
`"Hmmm........."`
`"As a man, isn't it your responsibility to meet people's expectations...?"`
`If I had to, I'm sure I could do it.`
`Mion has made me do so many different things for the club, and I've learned a lot from that.`
`Besides, this would be the first time I could get a reward without having to worry about punishment.`
`It should be fun too...`
`This was the first time so many people were counting on me like this.`
`To be honest, it made me pretty happy.`
`Still, I was worried about getting dragged into something that required a lot of work...`
`I couldn't erase that thought from my mind.`
`But I was in Hinamizawa.`
`The people in this village would never do anything to betray me.`
`They genuinely believed that it would do a lot to liven up the festival if I became the host of their auction.`
`I've only been here for a short period of time, but I know that the people here are honest and kind.`
`"Fine...`
` As a man, I'm going to do it.`
` I'll take care of it!`
`Wait and see... I'll make it the greatest auction in the world!! `
`Don't forget to get me that Angel Mort pass. I'll make sure to do a good enough job that I'll deserve ten years' worth of tickets!"`
`"Good for you, Kei-chan!"`
`Everyone gave me a round of applause.`
`...How many times had this happened in my life?`
`Not once.`
` This was the first time I'd ever been applauded.`
`"By the way, I'm surprised that no one disagreed with this suggestion at the meeting."`
`There are lots of old people in the village committee.`
`I'm a young guy who only just moved here...`
`...I've known for a while that Mion has a lot of influence locally, but I couldn't believe that everyone in the committee would accept it just like that...`
`"Most of them are that kind of hard-headed old people...`
` But the new generation is gradually taking over, you know!"`
`"We won the dam conflict, and now we're aiming to build a new era and grow more and more prosperous.`
` That's why we value the involvement of young people, and people from outside the village too!"`
`"You're young, and you're from the city. You also have a good reputation, so you're the perfect guy for this."`
`"I have a good reputation, huh?`
` I have no idea why so many people have heard of me."`
`"It's something to do with Mii-chan's punishments, I think... I think."`
`"I knew it!!"`
`"Ahhhahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Alright, then.`
` I'll call your parents about it tonight, so please let them know when you get back home today, okay?"`
`I'm sure my parents will have no problem with it.`
`...They won't have any objections to raise, at least.`
` They might ask me why my name was brought up, though...`
`Chie-sensei and the principal went back to the teachers' office after the discussion ended.`
`We were in the middle of lunch break at the moment.`
`Chie-sensei and the principal had come along together...`
` and Mion scared me by saying that they all had something to talk to me about.`
` My stomach wasn't digesting my lunch particularly well...`
`"Maebara-san! I heard everything! Good for you!"`
`"It's a big honor, being chosen by the village committee..."`
`"Hey there, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun.`
` I'd love to give that honor to you."`
`"N-No thank you... I wouldn't be able to handle it!"`
`I realized the whole class was talking about me.`
`They were saying how fun Watanagashi was going to be`
` and how high their expectations were for it.`
`...I might've taken on a huge responsibility.`
` I needed to do my best to succeed at it.`
`"By the way, I forgot something.`
`My Granny made tons of ohagi.`
` She told me to give them to my classmates."`
`Mion clapped her hands as she remembered, and took a box out of her bag.`
`She opened the lid, letting us see a bunch of ohagi neatly packed inside.`
`"Wow! There really are a lot!`
` I think there might be enough for everyone in the class to have one!"`
`"Hauuuu!!`
` They look sho yummy and kyute!"`
`"For some reason, my Granny loves making ohagi!"`
`"......That's because Souhei used to love them."`
`"Ah, yeah... I heard my Gramps used to like ohagi.`
`He ate tons of them!"`
`"For your grandma, ohagi is something that makes her remember your late grandpa, huh?"`
`"You think so?`
` I thought Gramps liked canned food."`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` You don't like canned food, do you, Shion?"`
`"What?`
` Is that true?`
` Why so?"`
`"Weeeeell... it's because of the smell...`
` I just don't like the smell of the metal..."`
`"Oh, is that so?!`
` After always forcing me to eat my squash, it turns out that you too have something you can't eat?"`
`"To tell you the truth, she hates canned food because...`
` heh heh heh!"`
`"Come on, Sis!`
` Don't you dare tell anyone!"`
`"I don't know what's going on, but it seems Mion knows a secret about Shion.`
` Tell it to us!`
` Go on!"`
`The reason why Shion doesn't like canned food must have been something pretty funny.`
`The two sisters battled for a while.`
`The machine-gun knee kicks Mion launched from close quarters weren't bad, but I don't think she expected Shion to land a capture suplex off it.`
`Guess Shion is the stronger of the two siblings...`
`"I'd rather tell you the truth than have you hear it from my sis.`
` See, there's this bad guy named Kasai...`
`He once told me`
` when I was still young and innocent... `
`that there's sometimes human meat mixed in with canned food!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha, I've heard of an urban legend like that before."`
`"Me too!`
` I once heard that there's dog meat mixed into beef bowls, and worms inside burgers!"`
`"A-A-A-Are you quite serious...?`
`I can never eat beef bowls or burgers again after hearing something like that..."`
`"You see, Satoko?`
` It was a very traumatic thing for me!"`
`"You have my sympathy, but I still have yet to forget about how you made me eat a full-course squash meal...!"`
`"You need to let go of that one.`
` That meal was delicious."`
`"Ah ha ha!`
` Because we're talking about this...`
` I'm starting to get worried there might be something mixed into this ohagi too..."`
`"Ohhh?`
` Well, at least with the ohagi that I brought...`
` You can't really be sure that there's nothing else inside...`
` Heh heh heh..."`
`............Ohagi that Mion brought.`
`...When you consider that, it's only natural to suspect that she probably did something to them.`
`...What's going on?`
` I felt like...`
` I was forgetting something...`
`But I didn't remember anything that I was forgetting.`
`It was like one of those deja vu moments.`
`I'd never been in this situation, but my mind was telling me that I'd been there before...`
`"......What's wrong, Keiichi?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I just feel like Mion has given me ohagi before...`
` But this is the first time, right?"`
`"Is it?`
` Mii-chan?"`
`"I think this is the first time.`
` You must be mistaking it for something else."`
`"According to my memory, this is the first time Mion-san has brought ohagi to school."`
`"................."`
`"Aaaah, I know!`
` You're being cautious because these are from this ol' man, aren't you?"`
`"That's nothing to brag about. I think you should be reflecting on your regular behavior."`
`"...Hahaha, you're right.`
` I wouldn't feel this way if Rena brought me ohagi.`
` Rena's really good at cooking.`
` They're small, but very carefully made..."`
`"Huh...?`
` I've never made ohagi before..."`
`.........What?`
` ......What was I saying?`
`Why did I say that Rena had made ohagi before...?`
`Why would I know that Rena makes her ohagi small but neatly...?`
`...?`
`I had no idea where that memory was coming from.`
`I could only assume it was an error in my brain.`
`Mion was saying that this was her first time bringing ohagi to class.`
`As I tilted my head in confusion, everyone started reaching inside the box.`
`Rena took out one for me and put it on the lid.`
`I stared at it closely.`
`What was I so concerned about...?`
`Mion said that I was probably concerned that she did something to the ohagi.`
`But it wasn't quite that...`
`I really didn't know how to explain it.`
`...I felt like I was forgetting something important.`
`I'd forgotten something important...`
` and all I had was the obligation to remember it.`
`In front of me was nothing but a single ohagi that came from Mion's house.`
`...I was frustrated,`
` but I really couldn't think of anything.`
`There's no way I could remember it.`
` Because`
` I didn't know anything.`
`"......Keiichi. You've been staring at your ohagi for a long time. What's the matter...?"`
`"Oh, it's just...... I'm experiencing deja vu.`
` Don't you get it sometimes?`
` It's your first time seeing something, but you feel like you've seen it before..."`
`"......So... you feel like Mion has given you ohagi in the past...?"`
`"...Hahaha. I'm sure it's just my imagination.`
` Mion just told me that she had never brought ohagi to school before."`
`"......Keiichi.`
` You can't have memories of what didn't happen.`
` If you remember something, I'm sure it really happened before."`
`Rika-chan told me something strange.`
`I didn't usually take her random comments seriously...`
`...But ever since I saw her making those predictions in the toy store, I've been curious about her 'special powers'.`
`I felt like she was telling me something deep.`
`"It's weird to hear that from you, since you're so great at making predictions.`
` Are you talking about the cycle of reincarnation or something?"`
`"......I don't know much about religion.`
`I just want to tell you that... if you know about something, that's something that happened to you.`
` I want you to 'try and remember' what happened. `
`I don't want you to treat it like you're just mistaken.`
` ......Do you understand what I'm trying to say?"`
`"Umm...`
` I guess..."`
`I was a little surprised by how serious she sounded.`
`I always thought that Rika was just an innocent girl who fooled around all the time saying things like "meep" and "nipah~".`
`But all of a sudden, she seemed like a totally different girl.`
`Was I supposed to take it as a joke...?`
`The serious look on her face told me it wasn't the time for jokes, though.`
`"If that's what you're telling me...... then I guess I got ohagi from Mion in a previous life."`
`"I won't make fun of you, so please tell me everything.`
` Why did Mii give you that ohagi?"`
`"The more I think about it... the more I think it's just my imagination.`
` Maybe it was just a dream..."`
`"......I don't care if it was a dream.`
` You must remember something.`
` Please tell me."`
`What was up with her?`
` She seemed so curious about it.`
`I didn't think this story was that interesting.`
`Her asking so much started making me feel uncomfortable.`
`Still, something told me that I needed to talk to Rika-chan about everything I could.`
`...Maybe she could predict my future by reading my dreams.`
`I should tell her everything.`
`After all, she's the shrine maiden for Oyashiro-sama.`
`"Well...`
` I think I skipped school that day...`
` I had a cold or something..."`
`My memory was scattered all over my brain, like powder.`
`I could see myself standing in front of the door...`
`Mion was there, and...`
` someone else was standing there too...`
`I think it was Rena.`
`"Mion brought me ohagi so I would get better.`
` I think she told me that her grandma made it, just like today."`
`"And then...?"`
`"Well...`
` Then I ate that ohagi.`
` ...After they went back home.`
` ......Then I found something inside the ohagi...`
` ......Ahahahahaha!`
` I'm sure I saw it in a comic book or something. `
`It's mixed up in my memory, but I'm sure I read it somewhere in some comic book.`
` Because it can't be true... ahahahahaha!"`
`"Keiichi... tell me what happened.`
` What did you find inside the ohagi...?"`
`"Well, I read this scary comic book when I was little... and there was a sewing needle inside of somebody's burger.`
` Ahahaha. You remember what Shion was saying just now? `
`It can be traumatic to hear a story like that when you're young."`
`I didn't remember much about that comic.`
`I think it was about this girl who had an accident, and held a grudge against the person who caused the injury on her face...`
`It was a really cheap plot now that I think about it.`
` But since I was still a little kid, that comic really scared me.`
`In one chapter, the girl casts a curse on the guy's food.`
`He eats a burger with sewing needles inside it, and he goes all`
` "Gyaaaaaaaah!"`
` Something like that...`
`It still freaked me out. The image was so grotesque and shocking to me...`
`That grew into a kind of trauma, and for a while I searched for sewing needles in my food every time I ate something.`
`I couldn't eat burgers for a while for that reason...`
`But my parents got concerned, and my hunger overcame the trauma.`
`Eventually, that experience disappeared into the flow of time...`
