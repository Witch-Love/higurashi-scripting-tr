`I dragged my body to school, hoping that Satoko might be there.`
`But, just as I expected... there was no one sitting in her seat.`
`...I felt all the more devastated just seeing it empty.`
`I had nothing left to bet on. All I could do was get hurt and suffer devastation.`
`Blood flowed from my broken heart and found its way out through my eyes in the form of tears.`
`"Is something wrong, Furude-san?`
` Is Houjou-san absent today...?"`
`The whole class was wondering why I came in late today, and why Satoko wasn't with me.`
`...But even if I felt sympathy from everyone's eyes on me, I didn't feel any promise from them.`
`No one here was able to save Satoko.`
` No one. No one could save her...!`
`Why should I have to keep smiling at all these useless people?`
`...This world is finished anyway.`
`If l leave matters alone, then a few days after the Watanagashi festival, my movie reel will be cut as I'm murdered like usual, and I'll return to the beginning of this month again.`
`And so I'll continue to live forever in June 1983.`
`Trapped here.`
` Even death won't set me free from that prison.`
`"Furude-san, please talk to me if something happened.`
` Where is Houjou-san?`
` Is she sick?"`
`"........Shut up."`
`The whole class gasped.`
`No one expected Rika Furude to talk like that.`
`...I, myself, made such blunt statements a few times in several past worlds, but it was always the first time anyone in that world heard anything like that. `
`...That must have been very easy for them, and I envied it.`
`"F-Furude-san......"`
`Chie was standing there dumbfounded.`
` I stood up from my seat.`
`If Satoko wasn't around, I didn't want to be locked up inside of this humid place.`
`"I'm going home..."`
`I'm not coming here anymore. Good bye.`
` ...I felt like saying something like that.`
`However, I retained the small hope that Satoko might go to school the next day, so I kept it to myself.`
`However, Chie wouldn't let me go.`
`She grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the teacher's office instead.`
`Chie told me to take a seat on a couch by the principal's office.`
`......She had no right to tell me what to do.`
`I could just escape through the open window.`
`As I didn't have that kind of energy, however, I sat on the couch as she told me to.`
`...I realized then that I didn't even have the energy to be rebellious.`
`...Maybe... Satoko felt the same.`
`She lost the energy to rebel, and so she was simply obeying her uncle...`
`"Furude-san.`
` Please tell me what's going on.`
` I'm sure I can help you."`
`Chie spoke to me, but I already knew that her words were empty.`
`All she would do was call the child consultation center.`
`She wouldn't go to the Houjou residence and pull Satoko out of there.`
`So there was no point... in even discussing the topic with her.`
`If I told her, she wouldn't keep it to herself.`
`...And shortly, everyone would know about what was happening with Satoko.`
`That would only result in chaos.`
`If they call the child consultation center, the staff from there will go and visit Satoko.`
`Her uncle will deny the abuse, and Satoko will also deny it because of the guilt she feels over Satoshi leaving.`
`Shortly after, they'll find out about the false reports Satoko made before, and they'll decide to not proceed any further.`
`Her uncle will allow Satoko to go to school for a few days, but his abuse will get worse because he'll think she's the one who called the child consultation center. `
`He'll do horrible things to her, just like her aunt did last year.`
`Calling the child consultation center will not help Satoko. It will instead put her in an even worse situation.`
`It's better not to notify them at all.`
`...But if we don't report it, then how else is this world supposed to improve...?`
`No.`
` Nothing is going to change.`
`There's nothing that can be done once this unfortunate fate overtakes Satoko.`
`"You say Houjou-san's uncle is back...`
` Is that true...?"`
`"............"`
`I had somehow answered all of Chie's questions without noticing.`
`I knew that nothing would change, whether I spoke to her or not...`
`So I just told her everything...`
` because I had no energy to rebel.`
`"I understand what's going on now...`
` This is horrible..."`
`"So...`
` now that you know what's going on, what can you do...?"`
`Chie answered right away, without faltering, already used to my spiteful tone.`
`"I will visit her house today.`
` I need to see Satoko-chan and talk to her first."`
`"Then if there's a problem... You're going to call the child consultation center, right?`
` They have it on record showing that she made false reports in the past.`
` They'll never do anything unless there's proof of abuse... `
`They're just like the police, who don't start investigations until after someone's dead.`
` They won't do anything unless Satoko is killed. `
`When that happens, this is what both the school and the child consultation center will say:`
` 'We never saw this coming. She was such a bright girl.' They'll just repeat the same words as if they were scripted. `
`Ahahahahaha. You people are idiots.`
` Ahahahahahaha..."`
`"I believe...`
` that the people from the center will do something about it.`
` I will make sure to tell them that she needs help."`
`...You've done the same in previous lives, too.`
`I wasn't denying her passion, but I couldn't say that there was meaning to it.`
`The problem wasn't with Chie.`
`The problem was with them.`
`No matter how hard Chie tried to seek help from child services, it meant nothing as long as they held biased notions about Satoko.`
`"It doesn't matter if they find proof of abuse or not!!"`
`I suddenly heard a voice from the hallway.`
`It was Shion's voice.`
`Chie shouted, "Who's there?!" and I heard Mion gasping, "Crap!"`
`They must have been listening to our conversation.`
`They were having a quiet discussion outside the door, but Shion accidentally raised her voice.`
` She gets so violent sometimes...`
`Four people entered into the room from the hallway.`
` Mion, Shion, Keiichi and Rena.`
`"I told you to stay in class!`
` Go back to the classroom!"`
`"We can't, not in this situation!`
` What are you going to do if something happens to Satoko?`
` Do you want to be responsible for that?`
` There's no time to waste!`
` We have to do something right now!! `
`My sis is saying that things will get worse unless there's some kind of proof of abuse, but it'll be too late once there is!!`
` Do you want to see Satoko dead, Mion?!"`
`"That's not what I'm trying to say!`
` Like I told you, Satoko once made a false report to the abuse hotline, and they have that record at the child consultation center! `
`Without proof, they won't investigate her case any further.`
` Just think about what that means!`
` It'll only make her uncle more furious!`
` Satoko's situation will get even worse!"`
`"What the hell!`
` They're supposed to help her before something happens, right?`
` Are they really not going to do anything unless she's seriously injured?"`
`"Calm down, you two...`
` I feel the same as Shii-chan and Keiichi-kun.`
` I don't want to wait until something bad happens.`
` But we need to think about what we can do!"`
`"What can we do?`
` Talk to the child consultation center, right?`
` If we had the guarantee they'd help her, it'd all be fine, but Mion, you're saying it's highly likely they'll put her case on hold, right?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` Unfortunately, that's what I think they'll do, just like last year.`
` On top of that, she was in an even worse situation then.`
` They put her case on hold even though Satoko was already in horrible shape. `
`But this time, it's only been a day since her uncle took her away.`
` Plus, her uncle has legal custody of her..."`
`"We don't need to be so roundabout!!`
` All we have to do is ambush that bastard and kill him!!"`
`"Shii-chan, you can't do that!!`
` Satoshi-kun wouldn't want that!"`
`"Then how should we save Satoko?!`
` Satoshi-kun entrusted me! He trusted me to look after Satoko!!`
` If anything happens to Satoko, I could never face him again!!`
`Having our hands tied until after Satoko's been thoroughly abused isn't an option!!`
` When a crime is taking place right before your eyes, is reporting it the first thing you do?`
` No, it isn't!!`
` You stop it! `
`We have to stop this ourselves!!!"`
`"Calm down, Shion..."`
`"You're the head of the Sonozaki family, aren't you?!`
` Use your power to save Satoko!!`
` You can do it, can't you?!`
` You have enough power to save her!!`
`...I know. The hag's policy is to stay completely out of Houjou affairs because of her grudge over the dam conflict, right?! `
`No matter what happens to Satoko, the Sonozaki main branch intends to ignore it, don't they?!!`
` If neither the child consultation center nor the Sonozaki family can save her, I have to do it on my own!`
`I'm going to do it. I'm going to kill that pig!`
` I'm going to do it right now. It's not going to take more than 1500 seconds for me to get to her house and stab him to death!!`
` What can you do in 1500 seconds?! `
`You can't do anything, can you?!`
` I'm going to do it. I'm going to help her!!`
` Let me go!!`
`I'm going to kill him right now! Waaaaaaaaah!!"`
`"Shion-san, settle down!`
` Stop saying that, or you're going to get into big trouble!"`
`They were desperately discussing how to save her.`
`...I just sat on the couch and stared at them vaguely.`
`I had seen this same discussion many times, in many different situations.`
` ...I was tired of listening to it.`
`The only difference was that everything was happening a few days earlier than usual.`
`"...............Rika..."`
`"...It's okay.`
` ...I'm not going to expect anything good anymore.`
` I don't have any hope left in my heart....."`
`Hanyuu made a sad expression.`
`I couldn't tell if she was sad about our fate, or if she was taking pity on me...`
`Just as she promised, Chie went to Satoko's house after school.`
`It had only been a day since Satoko's uncle took her away.`
`She wouldn't be able to tell if he'd hurt her already or not.`
`If the students hadn't made such a big fuss about it, Chie would have waited a couple of days before going to her house.`
`She already knew, however, about what happened to Satoko the previous year.`
`She also knew that her uncle was abusing her just like her aunt, and that he had neglected to act as her guardian for the whole year.`
`Considering those factors, it might not have been too soon for her to visit the Houjou residence.`
`Satoko hadn't shown up in school that day.`
`No one called the school to explain her absence.`
`That alone was proof that her uncle wasn't taking responsibility as her guardian...`
`Chie was going to her house to see what was going on with her own eyes.`
`She parked the car in the street and checked the map she brought from the school.`
` It said "Houjou Residence" on the sign in front of the house.`
` Chie was certain that this had to be the place.`
`The window on the second floor was open, and she could see a curtain hanging there.`
`From that window, she could hear the laughing voices of several old men.`
`No one had answered the phone when she called right before leaving the school...`
`She could also hear the clicking noise of mahjong tiles along with the voices.`
`She had never played mahjong before, but had a pretty good idea that was it from the way the men were talking.`
`If they were playing mahjong, there must have been three other men inside the house.`
`Her students had told her that Satoko's uncle was a very violent man.`
`Chie was a teacher, true, but she was also just a young lady.`
`She felt hesitant to ring the doorbell after hearing their disgusting laughter.`
`But courage drove her forward.`
` She made her decision and rang the doorbell.`
`She heard the bell ring inside the house.`
`But the laughing voices continued to echo from the second floor. It seemed as though they didn't hear the bell.`
`She rang the bell again, and this time the laughter stopped for a moment.`
`Someone must have heard the sound.`
` But soon after, they started laughing again.`
`It didn't sound like anyone was coming to get the door...`
`She thought someone heard the bell, but perhaps not...`
`Chie was sure they were home, of course.`
` She couldn't leave just because no one was answering the door.`
`She knocked and yelled loudly this time.`
`"Hello...!`
` Are you home, Houjou-san?!"`
`Finally, the laughter stopped and a man with a scary look on his face opened the door.`
`"Who the fuck are you?`
` Shut up and get the hell out of here!"`
`Chie felt intimidated by him, but her heart was filled with a teacher's pride and responsibility.`
`"Hello. Are you Houjou-san?`
` I am--"`
`Before she could introduce herself, Teppei screamed at her.`
`"Just shut up!!`
` I don't need no newspaper, no milk, no insurance!`
` I'm busy right now.`
` I'm working."`
`The people in the room laughed when he told her he was working.`
`Chie wouldn't give up.`
` She continued to speak.`
`"I'm the teacher at Hinamizawa Branch School. My name is Chie!`
` Is Satoko Houjou-san here?"`
`"Huh?`
` What the hell? What do you want with Satoko?"`
`"I came here because she didn't come to school today. I wasn't able to get ahold of her, so I'm wondering what happened."`
`"Huh...?`
` School...?"`
`"Yes. Is she home?`
` I need to talk with her."`
`"She's sick. That's right... she has a cold.`
` Satoko is resting because she has a fever..."`
`"I need to give her some handouts. May I please see her?"`
`"Fuckin' idiot.`
` Weren't you listening to what I just said?`
` Satoko is sick!`
` She's sleeping right now!`
` I can't let you see her!"`
`"I see...`
` Do you think she can come to school tomorrow?"`
`"Who knows?`
` I won't know until then!`
` You idiot!"`
`"............I, I see.`
` All right...`
` Please tell her that I came by...`
` Thank you..."`
`Chie bowed, but by the time she lifted up her head, Teppei was no longer there...`
`When Chie returned to the school, several students emerged from the classroom.`
`They were Keiichi, Rena, Mion and Shion.`
`Rika was also still inside the classroom, but she wouldn't come outside.`
`"Ch-Chie-sensei... how did it go?"`
`"You went to Satoko's house, right?"`
`"You were all waiting for me...?"`
`"Chie-sensei, how was Satoko doing? Was she okay...?"`
`".......Well... I didn't get to see her..."`
`"What the hell were you doing?!`
` You're a teacher, right?!`
` You came back just because he didn't let you see her?!"`
`"Stop it, Shion...!`
` That's about what we expected...!"`
`"I'm sure Satoko has a bruise on her face by now!`
` That's why he didn't want you to see her!`
` You should've just ran into the house!!`
` I can't even trust you anymore!!"`
`"...I'm sorry."`
`"Stop it, Shii-chan.`
` She did the best she could."`
`"Now we know for sure.`
` ...Satoko's uncle definitely has her locked inside the house..."`
`"We knew that from the start!`
` Rika-chama's been telling you all day today!`
` We wasted half a day just to find out if that's true!`
` How the hell do you think you can help Satoko?"`
`"Calm down!`
` Let's make a plan.`
` We care about her just as much as you do!`
` We're not going to abandon her. Let's come up with a way to save Satoko!"`
`"I already gave you my opinion, didn't I?`
` It's the best solution we have. I can handle it all by myself!`
` I only need your help to hide his body..."`
`"Stop it, Shii-chan!`
` Stop saying such violent things!!`
` Murder is a serious crime!!`
` It's the worst thing you can even think about!!"`
`"Then give me a different idea!!`
` If my idea is wrong, then give me a different one, even if it's only a little bit better!!`
` Come on!`
` Come on!!`
` See? You can't even say anything!`
` I can save Satoko in 1500 seconds! `
`I'll just drag his body to the Onigafuchi Swamp and dump him in there! I don't even need your help, Sis!`
` What's wrong? Why don't you come up with another idea for saving her?"`
`"That's not the point!`
` If you try to figure it out by yourself, that's all you'll think of!!`
` Let me tell you something...`
` 1500 seconds?`
` That's taking way too long!`
` I would save her within 1000 seconds! `
`If I were you, I'd just leave here silently and do what I want to do!`
` Do you know why I'm not doing that?`
` It's because someone told me once `
`that even if it's the only option you have, murder is still something that you should never do.`
` It's not the right thing to do, and it's never the best thing to do either! `
`You just think it's the best solution, because you're not thinking properly!"`
`A long time ago...`
` I don't know who told me this,`
` but someone taught it to me.`
`If there's something that troubles you, you can't think about it all on your own.`
`You can't think that your own solution is the best way to conclude things.`
`"We should all think about it together!`
` If we all brainstorm, I'm sure we'll come up with a better solution!"`
`"It's not about whether my idea is wrong or right.`
`Just think about it. Every minute we waste puts Satoko in more danger!`
`Do you hate the Houjou family that much? `
`No one is supposed to help Satoshi-kun and Satoko, no matter how much they're struggling?`
`I'm going to help her!`
` Get out of my way!`
` I'm leaving right now!`
` I'm going to stab that loser and save Satoko!"`
`"No, Shii-chan... Shii-chan!!"`
`"You guys should curse yourselves!`
` Curse your powerlessness!!`
` Fine, brainstorm for another idea. You'll never come up with one!`
` Just go ahead and neglect her!!`
` You've never really cared about Satoko!! `
`You only think of her as someone you can play with!!`
` But I'm different!!`
` She's more than just a friend for me!!`
` She's like my family!!`
` I care about her more than you guys do!!!`
` I'm going to go kill him now!! `
`Goodbye!!"`
`"......Wait a minute."`
`"What is it? Are you trying to stop me...?"`
`"Shion...`
` You're not understanding even half of what Rena is trying to tell you."`
`"What? I totally understand what she's saying.`
` We can save her right away with just the little courage needed to murder him, but she's spouting hypocritical garbage to hide that fact!"`
`"...Shion.`
` Do you think Satoko would appreciate it`
` if you saved her by committing murder?"`
`"I'm not trying to seek her appreciation.`
` I don't care what happens to me.`
` Her happiness is all that matters!"`
`"That's not right.`
` You're talking tough, but I know you're scared.`
`In fact, you asked Mion to help you hide the body.`
` In other words, you want to have a normal life after killing her uncle. `
`You want us all to be happy, just like a few days ago.`
` You want us to be back where we were.`
` But if you murder him, we'll never be like that again!! `
`Do you think you can really commit a perfect crime? You'll be arrested for sure!!"`
`"I'm prepared to face that!!`
` If I could end Satoko's suffering by doing time behind bars, I'd gladly pay that price!!"`
`"No. No. That's absolutely not true!!`
`You would curse yourself, and I'd bet on that.`
` You would curse yourself and regret it, wondering how you drew the short straw and became a murderer. `
`Then you'd finally realize what you really wanted.`
`It wasn't killing her uncle.`
` It was returning us all to our happy lives!`
` Your wish will never come true if you commit murder!`
`Satoko will also curse herself.`
` She'll blame herself, thinking she's the reason Shion became a murderer.`
` ...In fact, who's going to force Satoko to eat her squash if you get locked up?! `
`Who's going to talk about setting up mean traps with Satoko...?!`
`You're supposed to do those things!!`
` Shion Sonozaki!!`
` You have to be by her side at all times!!`
` Don't kid yourself!! `
`What you're trying to do is not for Satoko. It's just a huge mistake!!!"`
`"If that's what you're saying, do you have any idea for how to save her?`
`You don't, do you?!`
` You're such a hypocrite!!!`
` I said move!!`
` I'm killing him!`
` I'm going to kill him now!"`
`Keiichi blocked her way by standing in front of the door.`
`Shion gave him a hateful glare, but he just sent her back a confident smile.`
`"I can't let you go, Shion.`
` The world we all long for doesn't exist without you.`
` I'm not going to let you go."`
`"Is that so?`
` That means you're siding with Teppei Houjou.`
` You're just as guilty as he is. I'm going to bust your head open and kill you first!!!"`
`"Hey!!`
` Don't be stupid, Shion!!`
` Quit it already!!!"`
`"Shion-san!`
` What are you going to do with that chair?!`
` Stop it!`
` Put that chair down!!"`
`"He doesn't understand that I'm serious.`
` I have to show him how determined I am.`
` You better get the hell out of my way, now!"`
`"Shion... I admit that right now, I have no better idea.`
` But that's just for the moment.`
` I'm sure that we will come up with a better idea eventually!`
` I guarantee it.`
` I promise you that we're going to save Satoko. `
`So please, okay?`
` Trust your friends."`
`"If you're afraid of committing murder for Satoko's sake, you're not my friend anymore.`
` I'm not going to tell you this again!!`
` Get the hell out of my way!!!"`
`"Calm down and think about what you're saying!!`
` We will save Satoko somehow!`
` Just trust us!!`
` Don't try and look for a shortcut!!`
` Trust your friends!!`
` Trust me!!`
` I, Keiichi Maebara, am going to save Satoko for sure! `
`You can bet on it!!!"`
`"Shut up!!!`
` I can't trust you!!`
` What do you think you can do for her?!"`
`"...Sh-Shion!!!"`
`Shion threw the chair at Keiichi.`
`It hit him hard, and the chair fell to the floor with a loud noise.`
`But Keiichi was unfazed even after being struck.`
`He just stood in front of the exit without even covering his face.`
`Wait... he wasn't unfazed.`
`...A trail of blood was pouring from his forehead where the corner of the chair hurt him.`
`"Heh heh, that was nothing...!!`
` You thought I would move out of the way?!`
`I'm not going to move from here even if you kill me.`
` If I let you go, we might never see you again.`
`Satoko will think about you every day, and her heart will be filled with sadness.`
` If that happens, there won't be anything we can do... to make her happy.`
` ...It's going to be a very sad life for her.`
`I don't want Satoko to live in a sad world like that.`
` The future that we want is a wild and riotous one`
` just like what we had until a few days ago!!`
`Of course, I won't let Satoko's uncle threaten her any longer!! `
`I haven't decided how I'm going to do it yet.`
` But I will know soon!!`
` I promise!!`
` So, please!`
` Just trust me!!!"`
`"............"`
`Shion wasn't yet convinced...`
` but even so, she walked to the window and took her seat.`
`Somebody rested a hand on Keiichi's shoulder.`
`It was the principal... He had been standing there and listening to him for a while.`
`"Principal..."`
`"Well done.`
` Chie-sensei... I've heard what's going on."`
`"...I'm sorry... for being so powerless..."`
`"I know it's only been a day, but I think this is an emergency.`
` We should report this to the proper authorities."`
`"But, sir... She has called the child consultation center before..."`
`"They're not going to help her anyway!`
` It's just a waste of time!"`
`Shion raised her voice.`
` The principal looked at Shion and started talking.`
`"Shion Sonozaki-kun...`
` There's one word that I really don't like.`
` Do you know what that is?`
` It's what you just said...`
` the 'anyway'`
` that came out of your mouth. `
`That is the cruelest word, which means admitting defeat before you even fight.`
` By the time you've uttered that word, you've already lost your battle!"`
`"I agree with him.`
`I think we should try various options.`
` Calling the child consultation center should be the first on the list.`
` If that doesn't work, we can try our second and third options. `
`Don't give up before you try. That's just as bad as not helping her at all!"`
`"Principal, if you're reporting this, then...!!`
` You'll make sure to convince them that Satoko needs saving, right?!"`
`"Of course.`
` Houjou-kun is my precious student.`
` I'll do my best so that they will save her."`
`"They will try to take action as quickly as possible, so if we call now, they should get to her house later tonight."`
`"I hope they will help her...`
` But what if they put her case on hold...?"`
`"If that happens, we should come up with our next plan.`
` As long as we don't give up, we can help her somehow."`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
` Whatever you guys say!`
` Satoko is getting hurt as we speak!`
` Who's the one abandoning her here?!!"`
`"Shion.`
` I just promised you.`
`We are going to save Satoko!!`
` Not by committing murder,`
` but by saving her in a way that will make her happy!`
`You just watch us.`
` I, Keiichi Maebara, am promising you this!"`
`Shion stared out the window without looking at Keiichi's face.`
`"...I'll try and find out what the consultation center decides tonight.`
` I'll call everyone when I do."`
`"I hope they'll take her into custody..."`
`"We can't be optimistic about this.`
` I think there's a huge chance that they'll put her case on hold.`
` What are we going to do if that happens?"`
`"......If that happens...`
` Well...`
` ...Damn it...!"`
`"Chie-sensei.`
` Let's go to the teacher's office.`
` We need to make this call."`
`"Yes.`
` We need to make sure they really understand..."`
`They left the classroom.`
`Keiichi, Rena and Mion got together and discussed their other options.`
`Shion was looking down and crying...`
`Rika was...`
`...just vaguely looking at them as if staring at a boring TV drama.`
`...........Nothing will change.`
`The child consultation center will put her case on hold.`
`I've seen it so many times in previous lives.`
`I almost hope that they will take her into custody just this once...`
`But I have no more coins left to gamble on a hope like that.`
`In a previous life, Keiichi killed Satoko's uncle...`
` ...but Shion was not there when that happened.`
`...When she is, I suppose she's the one who takes on that role.`
`Their pathetic hopes will be crushed by tomorrow morning.`
`The social worker will be at her house tonight, but Satoko will deny that she's being abused.`
`Her uncle will assume that she was the one who called the service, and he'll abuse her even more.`
`She will come to school tomorrow because he doesn't want the child consultation center to be suspicious of him...`
`We will feel more and more hopeless when we see the dead look in Satoko's eyes...`
`I've been living for more than a hundred years, but I've never defeated this fate.`
` The fate of her uncle's return.`
`I was blessed with so much luck`
` and I thought I could defeat it this time.`
` But in the end, it all came down to the same thing...`
`It was a waste of energy to put in any effort.`
` It was worthless...`
` all worthless...`
`The more I thought about this inescapable fate, the more I pitied these people for talking endlessly about how they were going to save Satoko...`
