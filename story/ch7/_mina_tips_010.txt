`"I see... We're good as long as we know that the town council and the Onigafuchi Guardians aren't involved.`
` Please take care of Satoko Houjou-san's case without worrying about it too much."`
`"I will. I'm glad to know that the whole village isn't backing them."`
`"I wouldn't agree with them if they were, though. No matter who is pulling the strings, we must treat every case equally. `
`This whole odd rule that we have to give Hinamizawa special treatment is only due to the precedent set when we let threats influence us before."`
`"...Well, you're absolutely right, sir... but..."`
`"Please continue to work on this case. The manager from the municipal government assured us that the town council has nothing to do with this petition. `
`It's a problem that our organization is so afraid of one tiny community. As a manager, you should think about that a little."`
`"Yes, I'm sorry... Anyway, I'm glad to hear that the village isn't supporting them..."`
`"You must act the same way even if the village does support them. No matter who is behind the scenes!`
` Please be very careful with Satoko Houjou's case.`
` Don't try to give her any special treatment, you understand?"`
