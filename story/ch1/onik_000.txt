`...Somebody has been apologizing for a while now.`
`I wonder what she's apologizing for.`
`It felt wrong to eavesdrop, so I tried to ignore it.`
`It had been a while since I'd last went to the city. I only returned to attend the funeral of a relative.`
`Even though I'd lived there until last month, I found the bustle of the city to be overwhelming.`
`Those skyscrapers and the multi-lane roads.`
`The melodious cacophony of the crosswalk.`
`Even the campaign speeches blaring in front of the station felt nostalgic.`
`The place where I live now isn't nearly as lively.`
`There's only the chirping of locusts and the babbling of brooks.`
` And the cry of the higurashiâ€”the evening cicadas.`
`Rather than making me feel lonely, that quietness had begun to instill a sense of serenity.`
`There is nothing where I'm living now.`
`I don't just mean there aren't any burger joints. There aren't even vending machines.`
`No music stores, no restaurants...`
` and no arcades.`
`An ice cream parlor? No chance.`
`The nearest town has some stuff like that, but it's an hour away by bike.`
`But come to think of it, it wasn't really a big deal.`
`There were music stores and arcades and ice cream parlors where I used to live, but it wasn't like I ever hung out at any of them.`
`I had lived in the city for ten years and never once been to an ice cream parlor.`
`...I should have gone at least once.`
`It's only now that I'm starting to regret that a little.`
`...Somebody is still apologizing.`
`Who is she apologizing to?`
`She's apologized so much, so just forgive her already.`
`There's no reason anyone should ever need to apologize so much.`
`I started to feel a bit annoyed at whoever was refusing to forgive her.`
`No matter how bad the mistake, there's nothing that can't be forgiven.`
`There's no such thing as an irreparable mistake.`
`You just need to be more careful next time.`
`...She's still apologizing, even now.`
`Then... has she really done something that can't be fixed?`
`I have no idea what she's done, but if it can't be fixed, then that's all the more reason to forgive her.`
`No matter how much she apologizes, nothing will change.`
`But even so, she keeps apologizing in such a heartbreaking voice...`
`Hey, you. The one she's apologizing to...`
`Why don't you just go ahead and forgive her?`
`She's apologizing... in such a pathetic voice...`
`"Keiichi, we're almost there.`
` Wake up."`
`I was finally roused from my nap by my father's prodding.`
`It seemed the train had reached its final stop.`
`We'd spent hours riding everything from the bullet train to the local routes.`
`It was hard to believe that the landscape beyond the window and the city I was in half a day ago were in the same country.`
`No... that they were even from the same era.`
`From there, we'd take a car deeper into the mountains.`
`Past where the dense forest encroaching on the mountain road suddenly opened up...`
`There, where I live now. Hinamizawa.`
