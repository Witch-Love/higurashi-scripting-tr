`...With hatchets.`
` ...With pickaxes.`

`"AhhHhhhHhHhhh!!!"`
`"Eek! S-S-Sorry...!!!`

`Rena dropped the hatchet she was holding onto the grass after being startled by my voice.`
`"Keiichi-kun, you see, earlier, yeah, you said it would help if you had an axe or something, didn't you!?`
` S-So then I... brought a hatchet for you... from the shed...!!"`
`"Doesn't look like we can break that last beam without that hatchet.`
` You brought it after all... I'll have to borrow it tomorrow.`
