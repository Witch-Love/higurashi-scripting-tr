`*Tap*`
` *Tap*`
` *Tap*`
`The sound of muffled footsteps stopped in front of the door to my room.`
`A moment of silence... as if whomever they belonged to was ascertaining if I was inside.`
`...Of all the things I should have been doing, I continued on with my restless slumber.`
`I was very much conscious, but my body hadn't caught up yet.`
`...Even with danger bearing down on me from just beyond the door...`
` It was as if I was completely paralyzed, unable to move.`
`...Without a doubt, this was sheer terror.`
`Please... just leave...`
`Hey, why isn't my body awake yet?`
` If they came into my room right now... then...!!`
`"UwaAaAaAaAAaH!!!!"`
`"Eek!?"`
`I sprung to my feet and threw my covers at my mom, who was opening the door!!`
`"Whoa!`
` Keiichi!?`
` What's the matter?"`
`"Ah... Ahh... sorry.`
` ...I was still half-asleep..."`
`I thought it was still 1 or 2am.`
`But the morning sun was already streaming through the gap between the curtains.`
`...It felt nothing like morning.`
`Yesterday... I must have fallen asleep right after that.`
`...Then I should have gotten a full 10 hours of rest...`
`...But it didn't feel like that at all.`
`My internal clock was completely screwed up and my sense of balance felt off.`
`I felt feverish enough that it was clear to me that I was still not well.`
`"...Well, Keiichi?`
` How are you feeling?`
` Can you make it to school?"`
`...I felt far from well enough...`
` no, I wasn't mentally fit to go.`
`I was still plagued with the terror from yesterday...`
`If I had... swallowed that needle... what would have happened...?`
`Or what if it had pierced my tongue...?`
`There was undoubtedly a murderous intent... but I don't think that's all it was.`
`If they really wanted to kill me, then there were other, more certain ways to do it.`
` They wouldn't resort to such a dubious method as having me swallow a needle.`
`...Meaning... I didn't want to believe it, but...`
` going that far was... just a threat... from Rena and Mion.`
`"Aren't you glad you didn't die...? But next time we'll use a more assured method..."`
`Like that.`
`Something like sending a letter with a razor inside would have been a joke compared to this.`
`"...Did you make it to the hospital?`
` Did you take your medicine?"`
`"Mm... yeah. Kinda..."`
`Something about my mom's dubious gaze bothered me.`
`She seemed more concerned about her son missing two days of school rather than him being sick.`
`...It was definitely mental fatigue... I wasn't really physically ill.`
`"It'll be hard for you to get back on track once your daily routine is thrown off.`
` Come on, get on up!`
` They say wellness is a state of mind."`
`I'd heard that line many times before.`
`I was given an award in elementary school for having perfect attendance... but it wasn't like I was "healthier" than everyone.`
`"Come on, go wash your face.`
` Breakfast is already ready.`
` ...There isn't much time before Rena-chan comes and gets you."`
`Mom's tone meant I couldn't argue about it, so I had to give up on skipping a second day.`
`"By the way... were you the one who got bean paste all over the living room wall, Keiichi?`
` You shouldn't do something like that!`
` Your father was quite angry!"`
`...I didn't feel particularly guilty for doing it, so I didn't have much of a reaction.`
`Also, Mom didn't question me any further about it.`
`She headed back downstairs after she was certain I was getting up.`
`What Mion said as she left yesterday...`
` "I'd hate it if you missed school tomorrow..."`
` ...Came back and dwelled in the back of my head.`
`What did she mean by that...?`
`I didn't even have to really think about it.`
` ...She was saying, "don't be absent."`
`Taking that a bit further... It was the same as her saying I should just go about living my life as if nothing happened.`
`If I showed any signs of acting unusual, it would probably result in them making their move.`
`If I acted differently, someone like Ooishi-san, for example, might end up noticing that "something is up."`
`Meaning... if I didn't watch my mouth or did anything differently from the norm,`
` in effect, it would end up communicating something to those who were "undesirable"...`
`And it seems... that was something that the girls didn't intend to forgive.`
`So...`
` if I just went along as normal...`
` No harm would come to me...`
` Was that how it was going to be...?`
`All that misery I experienced up until yesterday would—almost creepily—just fade away... It was an enticing deal.`
`Just by forgetting everything I'd seen or heard these last few days... I'd be able to keep living on like normal.`
`"Th... There's no way such a`
`...`
` selfish thing could..."`
`I swallowed hard...`
`I once again deliberated on the idea that I had just rejected.`
`Mion... was probably a good person who had her friends at heart.`
`...She was giving me... who had mistakenly broken some rule of theirs... a chance.`
`Was what I did... really something so unforgivable?`
`But Mion had given me another chance.`
`...She was saying... if I just forgot everything and kept living on like I had been, I'd be forgiven...`
`"Keiichi~!`
` Your food is going to get cold!`
` Hurry up and get down here~!`
` Rena will be here if you don't hurry!"`
`"Ah... I'm coming!"`
`I crammed my textbooks into my bag and hastily made my way downstairs.`
`I picked at my somewhat bland breakfast.`
`It seemed that I didn't have much time. It was already past when I usually met up with Rena.`
`Given yesterday's events... she'd probably be here in the next five minutes.`
`...I needed to be ready to head to school by then...`
`I had to forget everything that had happened the past two days...`
`Forget it all and return to my normal life...`
`For this to be normal, I'll have to be where I normally meet up with Rena...`
`...Today of all days, the rice was dry and hard to get down.`
`Ding dong!`
`I jumped at the sound and dropped my chopsticks.`
` ...That chime signaled that Rena had arrived.`
`Mom hurried me along.`
`"Come on, Rena-chan's already here...!`
` Hurry, hurry!"`
`My mother's merry smile and my gloomy face were polar opposites.`
`Honestly, I was reluctant to see Rena, who was waiting there on the other side of the door.`
`...The Rena on the other side... was it the Rena I knew?`
`I couldn't keep her waiting...`
` I needed to do things as usual...`
`"Morning~!"`
`An invigorating greeting filtered in from across the doorway.`
`"...I came since Keiichi-kun was a bit late... will he be okay today, I wonder? ...I wonder?"`
`The manner in which Rena was concerned was, without a doubt, the Rena I knew.`
`...But that was probably only if I reciprocated.`
`Forget everything from yesterday... pretend as though nothing had happened...`
`Forget about the gruesome dismemberment.`
` Forget about the mysterious deaths that happened the following years. `
`...Forget about the people falling to their death... and the terminal illness and suicide... the fatal beatings... and the disappearances. Forget it. Forget all of it.`
`Forget that Rena and Mion were scary. Of course, forget it all.`
` Forget about all of it.`
` Forget about the mochi, too.`
` Forgetforgetforget.`
`Rena, once again, asked to make sure.`
`"...Can you... make it to school?"`
`"Y... Yeah... I'm fine."`
`"Great!`
` Then let's go! Mii-chan is waiting."`
`Rena showed me her usual bright smile.`
`I couldn't find any hint of deceit in her expression.`
` ...My nervousness dissipated, giving way to relief...`
`"But you see, Satoko-chan was so insistent she could do it~!"`
`As we were walking, Rena talked about a lot of different stuff, more so than usual.`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...Then?"`
`"Satoko-chan is clumsy, so she failed no matter how many times she tried!`
` ...Hau... she was shou kyuute..."`
`Everything Rena talked about was just silly nonsense, so I just replied every so often and laughed from time to time. It was a rather laid-back conversation.`
`We passed by one of our neighbors and they called out to us.`
`"Oh, my! Keiichi-chan and Rena-chan, aren't you two a bit late today~?`
` Mion-chan said she was going on ahead!"`
`"Uh-oh! Did Mii-chan look mad, I wonder?`
` ...I wonder!?`
` We need to hurry up, Keiichi-kun!"`
`After greeting our neighbor with a smile, Rena turned back to me and poked her tongue out.`
`Not expecting that, I couldn't help but crack a smile.`
`"...Ah, Keiichi-kun smiled."`
`"Huh... wh-what?"`
`Rena stopped and stared at me.`
`"...I was thinking that you still hadn't recovered from your cold since you seemed down this morning, Keiichi-kun... but now you seem fine.`
` ...Fine!"`
`With a grin, she gently poked my cheek.`
`It was a bright, sincere smile.`
`...Hey, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...How can you still doubt Rena after she shows you a smile like that...?`
`Maybe I just had a high fever up until today, and I imagined everything that I thought happened because I was bedridden and delirious?`
`...I really hoped that was the case.`
`If God would grant me just one wish...`
` There's only one thing that I'd wish for...`
`I would want what had happened in the past few days...`
`More specifically, from the night of the Watanagashi up until last night... I wanted all of that to have never happened.`
`I wonder how many times I'd wished for this these past few days...`
`As long as Rena kept on smiling like this... I think it might just become reality.`
`So I wanted Rena to keep on smiling...`
` ...Keep on... smiling...`
`"So, Keiichi-kun.`
` Those mochi yesterday... did you eat them all...?"`
`That vain wish of mine was instantly shattered.`
`My heart began palpitating. The relaxed morning mood suddenly became frigid.`
`Rena's smile... was the same as usual, her eyes were gentle as usual...`
`"Those mochi yesterday... did you eat them all...?"`
`...Of course she wasn't asking the question at face value.`
`In other words, Rena was asking...`
` "Did you get the message?"`
` ...She was probably trying to convey that...`
`" ...`
`Keiichi-kun?"`
`I was reluctant to give an answer. Rena stopped walking and stared deeply into my eyes.`
`"Ah..."`
`...Don't... Don't hesitate, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...Rena was acting the same as always, wasn't she?`
`I needed to respond in my usual way.`
` ...Naturally, of course...!`
`But both my throat and mouth had gone dry, and my lips were stuck together...`
`Hurry and answer, Keiichi...`
`Not that much time had passed.`
` I could still... keep the conversation going naturally...`
`I had to... say something quickly...`
`"...De-"`
`"De~?"`
`Rena playfully mimicked what I said when I finally squeaked something out.`
`Rena's reaction was still normal.`
` ...It seems that there wasn't as long of a pause as I had thought.`
`Somehow, I finally squeaked out the rest.`
`"D... Delicious...!"`
`However, my strained efforts neither sullied nor brightened Rena's expression.`
`For a moment I panicked, thinking I had replied incorrectly.`
`But after a few moments, Rena broke into her usual soft smile and giggled with a joyful voice that seemed to echo through the morning air.`
`Being strung along by that laugh... I couldn't help but laugh as well.`
`"I see~`
` So did you eat all of them, I wonder? ...I wonder?"`
`My timid smile froze again.`
`...Did you make it without swallowing the sewing needle?`
` Was that what she was asking...?`
`If I had swallowed it, then I wouldn't be here.`
`"N-Nah... I couldn't... finish all of them.`
` ...There's still some left."`
`I was scared out of my wits... but that's how I played it.`
`"...Huuh?`
` What about the homework to see if you could tell which one Rena made...?"`
`"Ahahahaha... that homework... was it due today?"`
`"Yeah. It's due today.`
` ...Mii-chan will get angry~ There's probably a penalty game ready for you."`
`We both laughed at each other again.`
`To a casual observer, it was just a typical morning.`
`If I could just let myself believe, then even I'd think it was just the usual morning routine...`
`But... I was certain I wasn't mistaken.`
`There was something unimaginable buried beneath the facade of this giggling Rena.`
`"LIES!!!"`
`I recalled that unexpected, piercing voice that I could hardly believe came from Rena's mouth.`
`The moment that image crossed my mind, I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back.`
`Was it only at that particular time that something evil had possessed Rena...?`
`No, that was wrong. That was still Rena. Ooishi-san told me, didn't he...?`
`"Actually, I looked into her. Before Ryuugu-san moved away to Hinamizawa, she was suspended from school.`
` It seems she went through her school building and broke all of the windows."`
`Rena had a disorder... that normal people didn't.`
` No matter how pleasantly she smiled... that fact would not change.`
`But... I couldn't even imagine... how she looked as she broke all the glass throughout the school.`
`One thing I knew was that it wasn't something spur-of-the-moment.`
`If it was some sudden outburst of anger, then maybe she'd break a pane or two...`
`But she broke all of the windows all throughout her school.`
`Just imagine going through your own school breaking the windows with a bat.`
`Swinging full-force at each pane of glass, one after another. Paying no heed to the flying shards...`
`Your classmates aghast.`
`...Unable to move from the sudden turn of events.`
`I wonder where she could have found the most windows lined up in a row...`
` ...Probably the hallway.`
`*Smash*`
` Walk...`
` Wind up...`
` *Smash*`
` Walk...`
` Wind up...`
`It was difficult for me to connect that horrifying image with the Rena smiling at me right now...`
`But... I just had to imagine it.`
`...Impossible because it was unimaginable... that naive way of thinking no longer worked.`
`The unpleasant, piercing sound of shattered glass, the crunching noise as Rena treads across the broken shards, walking towards me.`
`...Rena's classmates going pale as they forget to even breathe.`
`I wondered what they did as Rena came closer, breaking windows along her path...`
`Did they earnestly try to bring her to her senses by saying something?`
`Or did they jump at her, trying to stop her savagery?`
`Or did they run to the staff room to call for the teachers?`
`Probably none of those.`
`In the face of that bloodcurdling sight, of Rena busting window after window... undoubtedly, all they could do was silently clear a path for her.`
`Dumbfounded... just clearing the path for Rena to continue.`
`...It would be cruel to blame anyone for looking the other way.`
`No, they weren't simply looking the other way...`
` ...They knew it was the only way they could protect themselves.`
`If they had done something differently from the rest... They may have suddenly found themselves as Rena's new target.`
`What would Rena have done to whoever attracted her attention?`
`The answer was obvious.`
` ...She would have undoubtedly acted according to her whims.`
`...Meaning they would—I would—be the next window.`
`Rena, staring into my eyes, shards of glass crunching and crackling underfoot as she drew closer.`
`...I was also drawn into her eyes, paralyzed.`
`Then Rena struck me with the bat over and over again, like I was one of those windows.`
`I crouched down on to the floor, desperately protecting my head.`
` Rena didn't care whether it was my head or my back.`
` Zealously, she hit me again and again.`
`What kind of expression was she making as she was doing this over and over again?`
`...I peered up to see.`
`...Her expression was so indifferent, it was completely unnerving.`
`It's because no matter how many times she struck me, I didn't make as pleasant a sound as the other windows.`
`She struck me continuously.`
` Over and over again.`
` The sound Rena wanted didn't come out.`
` Our classmates standing around didn't try to stop her.`
` They didn't want to be the next window.`
`Somebody save me...`
` ...Turning a blind eye unless we're hanging out...!?`
`...But of course, everyone in class scrambled to obtain the highest standardized test scores.`
` ...They'd gain nothing from saving a cram school try-hard like me...`
`Eventually, there would be a faint sound, similar to when you crack open a walnut, and some sort of reddish-black spray would shoot out...`
`Anyway, it wasn't that Rena momentarily lost herself in her anger.`
`...After forcing myself to breathe and calming down my heart, I recalled what Ooishi-san told me.`
`"...and in the counselor's medical report, he recorded all of the conversations he had with Rena-san...`
` 'It' shows up...`
` And quite a bit at that."`
`"What does...?"`
`"She mentioned...`
` the word 'Oyashiro-sama.'"`
`Following that, Rena was suspended and had regular examinations at the hospital.`
`Then, as Rena was undergoing counseling, she said it over and over...`
` "Oyashiro-sama."`
`"It seems that the Oyashiro-sama she spoke of was like a ghost, appearing in her house every night.`
` Standing over her pillow looking down at her."`
`That was only a piece of their conversation, so I still couldn't see the big picture... but it was by no means a happy little conversation.`
`Then what Rena did... Was she saying that ghastly incident was a result of her being possessed by Oyashiro-sama...?`
`Up until now, I didn't want to believe in Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`That's why I wanted to say the mysterious deaths every year happened because of some sort of conspiracy.`
`Every time I talked with Ooishi-san, I was more certain that the deaths were the work of men and not of some curse.`
`Except... if it was people perpetrating the incidents... my friends were somehow deeply connected.`
`If I refused to believe that the curse was real... then I would have to believe those who acted the kindest to me were deeply involved in the incidents.`
`Why?`
` How?`
` For what reason?`
` ...Was Rena?`
` ...Was everybody?`
`It was much more painful and troublesome than accepting that it was just Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`In the aftermath, Rena had admitted to her doctor that it was because she was possessed by Oyashiro-sama.`
`I felt a strange sense of relief from that.`
`So that's how it was.`
`There wasn't a second side to Rena.`
`...She did that...`
` because she was possessed by something strange like Oyashiro-sama...`
`It wasn't Rena's fault.`
` Oyashiro-sama was the one to blame...!`
`I knew...`
`This was all backwards.`
`Refusing to believe there was a curse, I wanted there to be a human perpetrator. `
`...Now that my close friends were the ones under suspicion, I changed my beliefs at my own convenience, saying it was Oyashiro-sama's curse to blame.`
`Which was the better choice? Accepting that Oyashiro-sama's curse exists...`
` Or that Rena and the rest of them... were deeply involved in the string of mysterious deaths?`
`I didn't want to think about it.`
`If I just didn't think about it, I'd be able to continue the same as always... I wanted to believe that...`
`But...`
` ...`
`That was no longer possible.`
`I had received their message.`
`...It was pathetic of me to try and bend the meaning to my own convenience.`
`Regardless of whether my opponent were a human or a curse.`
` ...I won't let it kill me.`
`As if I would just bend over and give in!`
` ...For no good reason at all...!`
`"Keiichi-kun?`
` ...You've been making a really weird face.`
` Why, I wonder?`
` I wonder?"`
`Inhaling sharply upon hearing Rena's voice, I came back to my senses.`
`Before I had realized it, we were already at the entrance.`
`Shaking my head a few times, I exorcised all those terrifying thoughts.`
`No matter how you looked at it... there's no way Rena could have done such terrible things...!`
`It was like I was trying to placate myself...`
`As I slid the door open, a blackboard eraser loaded with chalk dropped down on my head the moment I stepped into the classroom.`
`The chalk dust went into my eyes, inducing a brief moment of agony.`
`"Oh ho ho ho ho!`
` How befitting for the truant Keiichi-san~!"`
`"Good morning to both of you, Keiichi and Rena."`
`"Good morning-☆ Satoko-chan, Rika-chan~!"`
`Not quite in the mood for it, I didn't really react to Satoko's trap.`
`Satoko braced herself as I passed by, expecting me to attack her. She seemed a bit disappointed as I simply walked by silently.`
`"Wh-What is this...?`
` How discouraging, indeed."`
`"...Keiichi doesn't seem back to his usual self yet."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Take it easy on him for today, 'kay?"`
`Suddenly, there was a slap down on my shoulder. It hurt a bit...`
`"Hey! Kei-chan, did you get enough rest?"`
`It was Mion.`
`My mind was full with the stuff about Rena... but Mion was also a party of interest.`
`Remember, Keiichi.`
` ...That hawkish gaze from yesterday.`
`"`
`...`
`Yeah... Morning."`
`"What's with that unenergetic greeting?`
` Did you eat the mochi I brought you?"`
`I'm like this because I ate them...`
` Those words were itching to be blurted out.`
`"...I really just didn't have the appetite.`
` ...I ate a few, but quite a lot were left over."`
`"Huh? What about the homework?`
` Do you have an answer for which one was Rena's?"`
`"Keiichi-kun said he forgot his homework.`
` Ahahahaha."`
`"...Sheesh... then we can't help it... time for your penalty~`
` ...Mihehehehe!"`
`Flashing a lurid smile, Mion returned to her seat.`
`There was nothing from our exchanges that would cause our classmates to suspect anything was amiss.`
`But of course...`
`Anyone listening to our conversations up until this morning...`
` wouldn't see anything suspicious.`
`That was why... it was so frightening.`
`They acted in a way that, regardless of whatever happened to Keiichi Maebara, no one would ever suspect them... That fact had me terrified.`
`Soon the teacher came.`
`After she asked how I felt and took attendance, another dull, ordinary day began.`
`This free study period was a convenient time to consider where I stood.`
`I gently closed my eyes and pondered the ridiculous position I was in right now.`
`First of all... What I shouldn't forget... was how dangerous of a situation I was in.`
`I had fallen out of favor with them.`
`After interacting with Ooishi-san multiple times, I could see it as I was getting closer to the heart of the matter.`
`The warning yesterday with the mochi was a good indicator of that.`
`...No... Calling it a warning was just my habit of understating things.`
`It probably had no meaning beyond stunting my progress and buying themselves some time.`
`...Until they had a method of completely 'erasing' me...`
` They were just biding their time.`
`Even though they were keeping me under their thumb with threats, it didn't change the fact that I knew too much.`
`The chilling sensation of my desk made me recall Satoshi Houjou, the boy who was using this seat until last year when he disappeared.`
`Was he also... similar to me?`
`Did he learn something he shouldn't have... and was erased...?`
`...Damn...!`
` I wouldn't... let them get rid of me so easily...`
` Never...!!`
`But... were they really trying to kill me...?`
`I've had these contradictory feelings for a while now. Even though I suspected them... I felt I had to cover for them.`
`Even having witnessed all of their suspicious behavior, a morning like this just made it all seem like an elaborate hoax.`
` No, that's just what I want to believe.`
`Doubting my friends?`
`Covering for them?`
`My life was in danger...`
`Or was it?`
`Actually, I was debating the wrong point.`
`Given my current situation... Those points were something that should have been deliberated on a long time ago...`
`But really... Rena and the rest of them...`
` Were they actually aiming to kill me?`
`The little voice inside me continued to torment me with these unresolvable trains of thought.`
`Are you an idiot, Keiichi Maebara!? The answer should be obvious!`
`B... But maybe... that sewing needle might have been just an accident, right...?`
`How could you screw up and drop a sewing needle into a piece of mochi!? The benefit of the doubt can only go so far!!`
`Both Rena and Mion... had acted and behaved suspiciously... but maybe it was all some sort of misunderstanding...`
`What kind of misunderstanding!?`
` It wasn't just suspicious... it was outright ludicrous, right!?`
`Rena just corrected me for lying... and Mion only asked me about what I had for lunch...`
`Rena was standing outside my door eavesdropping for a solid hour!?`
`Sh-She was... probably just waiting for my phone call to end...`
`For a whole HOUR outside your room!? And is it normal to go home afterwards without saying anything!?`
`...`
`You heard from Ooishi-san, didn't you!?`
` About what Rena did at her former school?`
`B-But... At the hospital, she said it was Oyashiro-sama's fault she...`
`"Cut it out, Keiichi Maebara. Don't you realize they're out to kill you!?"`
`Ngh!?`
`I inadvertently blurted those words out loud.`
`Hearing myself say that so directly left me dumbfounded for a few moments. Afterwards, I had to look around to check if anyone else had heard it.`
`My little soliloquy cut a little too close to the truth.`
`Even though I could feel the murderous intent from Rena and the others... part of me somewhere was still trying to deny that.`
`This late in the game... such hesitation could be fatal.`
` ...I knew that.`
`But... I was just your average student... a man living his normal, ordinary life!`
`Do you think I could suddenly believe... that my friends, who I had been happily laughing together with up until last Sunday... now intended to kill me...!?`
` Right...?`
`"You're too soft, Keiichi!!!!"`
`This time, I remembered to keep my voice down so only I could hear it.`
`There was one thing I now understood.`
`I was... too soft.`
`I didn't completely understand how dangerous Rena and the rest of them were.`
` No, I wasn't trying to understand.`
`I was too soft for not listening to Ooishi-san when he was earnestly showing me the heart of the matter.`
`I didn't listen because I was too busy pretending to be dejected.`
` I didn't comprehend it.`
` I was just running away.`
`I didn't comprehend it, so nobody had any notion to try and kill me? I needed to get rid of such naive thoughts...!`
`As I made that resolution, I heard the bell signaling the end of class.`
`...So soon.`
`The day was already over.`
`I didn't recall eating lunch or doing anything in class.`
`My friends were putting their desks together in preparation for club activities.`
`Not long ago, I would probably have happily jumped into that circle...`
`"My, my, Keiichi-san?`
` How rude of you to even think about leaving!"`
`The way Satoko spoke was so typical and familiar... it almost physically hurt.`
`"Huh? Keiichi-kun, is today not a good day, I wonder? ...I wonder?`
` And we were going to win big together...`
` Hau..."`
`Seeing Rena's expression... which said she was really looking forward to today, was hard to take.`
`Hey, Keiichi... Maybe Ooishi-san is just some enormous jerk trying to separate me from the others by lying to me...?`
`Slap!!`
`Trying to expunge such weak-minded thinking, I slapped myself in the face.`
`"K-Keiichi-kun...?"`
`Yeah... was Rena really trying to kill me...??`
`I wish someone would tell me it was a hoax.`
` I didn't care if it actually was one or not, I just wanted someone to say it was.`
`...Guh, yet another weak-willed thought...!`
`How did I ever become this naive!?`
`"A-Are you all right...? Does your head hurt?"`
`Apparently that was how my inner dilemma appeared to Rena.`
`"You're pale!`
` Can you make it home by yourself?`
` ...Maybe I should accompany you home, I wonder? ...I wonder?"`
`"No... it's okay... sorry.`
` I can get home by myself.`
` Just have the meeting without me."`
`Upon hearing that I wasn't going to participate in the club meeting, Mion pouted unhappily.`
`"Since Kei-chan was so bent on a revenge match, we were even going to play that deduction game from before too."`
`"Keiichi-san doesn't have the burning desire for a rematch?`
` How pathetic~!"`
`I wouldn't fall for some dumb taunt.`
`Without even a real retort, I just grabbed my bag and was about to get up.`
`Someone's hand perched itself gently on my head.`
`"... Keiichi doesn't seem to be well.`
` ...How very unfortunate."`
`It was Rika-chan.`
`She was stretched up as far as she could, doing her best to pat my head with her petite hand...`
`It felt so nice... which made things even harder.`
`"Sorry...`
` Everybody.`
` ...See you!"`
`That's all I said as I quickly left the classroom.`
`They said something to me as I was leaving, but I couldn't make it out.`
`I managed to make it all the way to the entrance in that state of mind.`
` Took out my shoes...`
` put them on,`
` and went forward.`
` Forward...`
`Harden that heart... Keiichi Maebara...!`
`They were... for some unfathomable reason... trying to kill me!!`
`They were plotting something dubious, watching my every move!!`
`But... I couldn't hate them...!!`
`Because... weren't they my friends!?!`
`Part of me lamented my naiveté, while another part lamented the fact that I had lost something important by lamenting over it in the first place.`
`It felt like my personality was being ripped in two, along with my body.`
`If this is what Oyashiro-sama's curse was like...`
` Then it was just... too harsh.`
`Hey, Oyashiro-sama... I was wrong for not believing in your curse...`
`But I believe in it now.`
`Completely.`
`Your curse does exist...`
`So, seriously... give me a break...`
` I beg you... come on...`
`Dinner was unusually bland.`
`It had no flavor or aroma.`
`...The miso soup that normally tantalized my appetite instead tasted like nothing but boiled water.`
`Dad was eating with us that night.`
`It was a rare occurrence in this household.`
`When he got into his work, he ate and slept on his own schedule.`
` My dad never cared about the time.`
`Since my dad was at the dinner table, it either meant he had just reached a good point to take a break or he was in a slump.`
`"So yeah, he just doesn't understand the motivation creators have."`
`"Your partnership was just a verbal agreement, wasn't it?`
` If it's so hard to agree on things, why not just end it?"`
`"I feel like it's an industry with a lot of back-scratching... but when it gets in the way of business..."`
`I wasn't able to pick out much of my mom and dad's conversation, but I could tell it wasn't a very pleasant topic.`
`...That, of course, made the disgusting food even less appealing.`
`Staring listlessly at the exchange between my parents, my mind wandered off to the same thought processes I had going all day long.`
`...Friends close to me—no, they used to be friends. But I could no longer trust them. Right now, I was greatly lacking in allies.`
`People I trusted... people I could depend on when push came to shove. They were something I just didn't have.`
`...Having just one ally would have been incredibly reassuring in the currently hopeless situation I was in...`
`I put down my chopsticks and looked over at my parents, who were still talking about work.`
`The first course of action that came to mind was to tell my parents everything.`
`Currently, there wasn't a single person from Hinamizawa I could trust 100%. That meant the only people I could trust were my parents.`
`But... If I told them everything that happened up until now, would they understand?`
`Rena, for example.`
`That neighborly Rena, who was so diligent in looking after me, came to get me every day, and sometimes brought over a share of what she made.`
`How could I explain... that she wanted to kill me??`
`No matter how I explained, it would probably be difficult for anybody to comprehend.`
`My somewhat eccentric dad wouldn't understand, and my high-strung mom would probably drag me off to a psychiatrist in the blink of an eye.`
`Sadly... That was the amount of trust that existed in our relationship.`
`Even if they did come to understand... what could they possibly do?`
`Unless they could uncover the truth, they wouldn't be able to protect me.`
`...No... By informing them of these 'unnecessary' things, I'd be putting my parents in danger as well...!`
`Considering that the victims in past incidents were often married couples... I couldn't even joke about it.`
`For the entire Maebara family to have an accident or to just vanish into thin air... It was easily possible in Hinamizawa...`
`What was important here was that knowing something 'unnecessary' put you in danger.`
`The most unsettling question was... how did they know that I knew...?`
`"As long as they didn't know," my parents might not fall victim... that was one way to think about it, I guess...?`
`At least it was like that in my case.`
` After I found out, things started becoming odd.`
`...In other words, it meant the following:`
`As long as my parents didn't know anything, nothing would happen to them.`
`Which means that this house would be a safe haven as long as my parents were in.`
`...I knew these were just assumptions based on conjecture on top of conjecture.`
`Wanting this house to be a safe haven... that was the pinnacle of my weak-willed method of thinking.`
`I had to concede that it was not completely safe... It was only safer than the outside...`
`I knew that I couldn't rely on my parents? No... I couldn't risk getting my parents involved.`
`Then the only person who could be my ally would be... Ooishi-san. Him, and him alone.`
`He was the only person who understood the situation I was in.`
`He didn't care so much about my safety, but he was without a doubt passionate about solving this case.`
`...It was a bit frustrating.`
`...Ooishi-san was basically the whole reason I was in this mess. Now to get out of it, I had to rely on him...`
`Meaning... it was all going according to his devices.`
`It was just my job to look appetizing while bobbing in the waves as bait.`
` ...Then, when the fish started gathering around, Ooishi-san would pull up the big haul!`
`It was slightly infuriating... but even I thought that was the best course of action.`
`So, then... what should I do!?`
`...Patience was the first rule of fishing.`
`Just keep waiting until the fish actually bites...`
`But I wasn't simply bait.`
`There were lots of ways for me to struggle before being devoured.`
`When they struck, I needed to somehow dodge just enough and tag out to Ooishi-san.`
`No question, it was going to be hard.`
` ...The timing to bring Ooishi-san in would be difficult.`
`He was in the city, not Hinamizawa.`
` So if I phoned him in my moment of need, it would take him about 30 minutes to reach me.`
` So I needed to run away for those 30 minutes...`
`For example... if we set up a rendezvous point for dire situations or something.`
` I'd just have to hide out there until Ooishi-san arrived.`
`"...Okay... I can almost... see it now..."`
`I was still being chased around in the dark by boogiemen, but now I knew which way to go. I would never have imagined this would be so reassuring.`
`Oh yeah...`
`It would probably be best if I had a concealed weapon for when things got rough.`
`...Typically, that would call for a switchblade.`
`But that wasn't too reassuring for combat.`
`Also, since it was recognized as a weapon by the public, that also wasn't good.`
`Really, when the time comes... a long weapon like a bat would work in my favor.`
`I remembered there was a metal bat at school.`
` ...I could be confident with that when push came to shove.`
`...If I pretended I was practicing my swing, then it wouldn't be suspicious for me to always carry it around.`
`...I could go to school early tomorrow and secure it.`
`Just possessing a weapon may be enough to deter them.`
`Also, one more thing... Insurance...`
`It could be something like a note or memo. I could write down everything that's happened as a sort of journal.`
`In case I suddenly vanished, the journal would be left behind.`
`...With my journal in his possession, Ooishi-san should be able to avenge my death.`
`I left my parents engrossed in their conversation about work and went back to my room.`
`I tore out a piece of paper from a notebook and made my way to my desk.`
`...Last time I wrote a journal was for summer homework in elementary school.`
`In the off chance something bad happened, the police could use my diary as a lead.`
` ...So I should only write down the facts.`
`How should I start...`
`I jotted down my thoughts as they came.`
`"I, Keiichi Maebara, am in fear for my life."`
`It made me laugh nervously. It was a line that showed up often in detective stories. I never even dreamed that I would be in the type of situation where I'd write it myself.`
`"I do not know why they are after my life."`
`Rena and the others were suspicious, but I had no proof.`
` ...And that's why I couldn't write anything more.`
`I laughed wryly at myself for writing such a passage draped in mystery.`
`Would the police be able to get the hint from reading this enigmatic passage?`
`I could only pray that they would.`
`...What I prayed for the most though, was that this journal never needed to play its part...`
` Here, I laughed nervously.`
`It was too simple, so I wrote down one more line I just thought of.`
`"The only thing I do know is that it has to do with Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`Was that... too much...?`
`...I probably shouldn't write more than that.`
` ...If I wrote any more, then it would seem like I was just delusional.`
`In order to appear to the reader that the person who had written this was of sound mind... I chose not to write anything else at that point.`
`...I just needed to add more as I learned more about the truth.`
`I folded the paper and thought about a place to hide it.`
`...By hiding it somewhere obvious, there was the chance that 'they' would uncover it instead.`
`On the other hand, if it was in too obscure of a location, then there was the risk of nobody finding it at all...`
`In the end, I decided to take the clock off my wall and stick my folded note on the back of it with scotch tape.`
` After that, I put the clock back into its normal position.`
`Yeah...`
` It didn't look like anything was hidden behind it.`
`Now I needed to set it up such that, "if anything happens to me," my parents could find it.`
`I looked at it from countless different angles until I was satisfied and I made my way downstairs.`
`My parents were still talking about work.`
`It didn't look like it was going to end anytime soon, so I cut in.`
`"Ah, sorry to interrupt!!`
` ...I have something I want to talk to you about."`
`I'd never started off a conversation like that before, so my parents were both startled. They stopped talking and turned towards me.`
`"What is it, Keiichi?"`
`"I have a favor to ask of you, please listen.`
` ...Um, just in case, yeah?"`
`"If it's not urgent, can we do this later?`
` Right now, Mommy and Daddy have something urgent they're talking about."`
`I didn't think their talk was more urgent than mine. In any case, I stated my request.`
`"Just in case, okay?`
` If I die..."`
`Both of my parents' eyes went as wide as saucers.`
`"If I die...`
` I want you to put the clock on my wall in my coffin."`
`If they did that, then they'd probably find it.`
` My memoir.`
`Both my parents remained wide-eyed, not moving an inch.`
`...I couldn't blame them.`
`"I made that clock in shop class and I really like it...`
` So, please."`
`"...What's the matter?`
` Keiichi...`
` Did something happen?"`
`Mom was finally able to ask me with a questioning gaze.`
`Of course, this was a normal response for when someone's son suddenly talked about a subject like this.`
`I felt bad about making them worry, but right now I just wanted them to think about the 'clock' in my room.`
`With the awkward mood leaving the room in silence, I decided to go back up to my room.`
`"I... want to get to school early tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.`
` Good night."`
`Saying only that, I left the living room.`
`I needed to get to school early tomorrow and secure that bat.`
`I should make today the last day I went to school with Rena.`
`As I climbed the stairs, I heard my mom call my name, but I pretended not to hear her.`
`It wasn't something I could talk about with my parents.`
`If I talked about it... it would only make things more dangerous.`
`The fight that had begun was mine and mine alone, I couldn't rely on anybody.`
`I wouldn't be killed...`
` Not when I still knew nothing...`
