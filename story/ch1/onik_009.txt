`A few days had passed since the incident.`
`During that time either Mion was busy or Rika-chan had to help with the festival preparations, so we couldn't get everybody together for club activities.`
`Even though I thought I would never want to participate again after the years it shaved off my life each time, not having it only made my heart grow fonder.`
`...I really am not honest with myself.`
`Today we finally had our club activities again.`
`These weren't the same old club activities.`
`It was called the Watanagashi Five-Demon Fire Fight!!`
`And it was one of the biggest events in the club.`
`"Keiichi~`
` Does this yukata still fit you?`
` Can you try it on for a second?"`
`Mom pulled out an old, dusty yukata.`
`"Nah, I don't need a yukata...`
` Those are embarrassing, so I'll just go in my normal clothes."`
`"But this is a festival. Wear it, okay?"`
`"Rena and the others said regular clothes are just fine.`
` If I was the only one wearing a yukata, it'd be even more embarrassing!"`
`I put on the same old vest as usual.`
`"I'll be going with Rena and the others,`
` so you don't need to worry about me."`
`"Is that so?`
` I'll be going with Dad when he wakes up."`
`Dad let out a loud snore from the sofa.`
`"From how it looks... he must've pulled an all-nighter last night."`
`"He just finished sending in his manuscript.`
` So he might not wake up for a while..."`
`It seems my dad writes for art magazines sometimes, too.`
`...I've never read it, though.`
`I wonder if my dad... is a really famous artist.`
`...As his son, it's a bit strange for me to say, but I can't imagine he's selling all that well.`
`But he's able to feed a family of three, and my life isn't exactly full of hardships.`
`Maybe he's actually a master painter... and I just never knew it...`
`Ding dong~~!`
`"Keiichi-kun, are you home~~!?"`
`Uh-oh! It was already time!`
`I didn't want them coming here, so I was planning on leaving early and waiting outside...!!`
`"Oh my, it's Rena-chan!`
` Thank you for always looking after Keiichi...!"`
`"Ah... M-Ma'am... H-He's also... b-been looking... out for..."`
`Why are you blushing just from meeting my mom!?`
`"Don't get all flustered!`
` This feels so awkward!`
` Let's go, Rena!"`
`Since Rena would continue to space out if I left her here, I grabbed her hand and dragged her out.`
`"Rena-chan~! Look after Keiichi for me~!"`
`"Hao!... Yes, Ma'am~~~!`
` Even if it means I must sacrifice myself~.☆"`
`Then why don't you do it right now!?`
`She waved back even as I was dragging her away.`
`"Okay~, Kei-chan!`
` You hungry today?`
` We'll take care of that at these stalls!"`
`"You thought I'd let myself get full knowing the club activities will involve the stalls!!?"`
`"Wouldn't have it any other way!"`
`"Where are Rika-chan and Satoko?`
` Are they already at the temple?"`
`"Yep! Rika-chan's a festival committee member after all.`
` Satoko-chan is probably with her as well."`
`"I see.`
` ...`
`All right!`
` Let's make some noise today!!"`
`""Yeah~~~~~!!!!""`
`We were already in high spirits with just the three of us there.`
`It was way more lively at the Furude shrine than the last time I came, far exceeding my expectations.`
`Throngs of people were crammed between rows of market stalls lined with colorful paper lanterns.  Despite that, it was actually quite enjoyable.`
`"There sure are lots of people here!!`
` I can't believe they all live in Hinamizawa..."`
`"Everybody attends the Watanagashi.`
` I think about half the village is here."`
`"It's not just that.`
` Municipal and youth councils from neighboring towns and villages advertise this event as well."`
`"That's right.`
` There aren't that many students at our school.`
` But there's a lot of kids here today."`
`"It just doesn't feel like a festival unless there are kids running around, after all."`
`That's true. I agree.`
`"Ah, hello and good evening~!"`
`These two knew everybody we came across.`
`Of course I greeted them as well, but I still wasn't familiar with everybody yet.`
`"Oh, Rena-chan.`
` Thanks for the food you brought me a while back!`
` My son loved it. He said it was delicious."`
`"Ah, it was nothing at all.☆`
` I'm glad he liked it.`
` Say hello to Kazumasa-kun for me, please!"`
`"Hey!`
` If it isn't Sonozaki-ojouchan!`
` I'm in charge of a stand again this year, so make sure you come visit!!"`
`"Pops, have you gotten fatter!?`
` You'll end up having a heart attack with a gut like that!"`
`"Oh. This kid here is new.`
` Are you one of her underclassmen!?"`
`"He's one of my members.`
` ...An upcoming hopeful!  If you cross him, he could crush your stand in one night!"`
`"You've got little missy's seal of approval, I see! Hope you take it easy on me~!!!"`
`As you could imagine, Mion was chatting away with the old guys running the stalls.`
`"Mii-chan is really energetic, after all.`
` She's really popular with the older men."`
`"I think Rena is pretty popular too.`
` Being cute and all."`
`That was, of course, so long as her little 'condition' didn't flare up.`
`But as long as she's blushing quietly, she's pretty cute.`
`"...Uhh? ...I'm...`
` popular with some people? Really?`
` Really!?"`
`"With some people."`
`I evaded giving her a straight answer by roughly tousling her hair.`
`"The stall keepers came all the way from town.`
` It's not really a festival without them, after all!!"`
`"So, we're going to mess with them now?`
` ...I don't care what kind of match it is, I'm going to win it!!"`
`"Oh, yes. ...Ehehe... I'll try, too!"`
`"Heeey!!`
` You're all very late!!`
` It's unacceptable to keep a lady waiting, Keiichi-san~!!!"`
`"Ooh~ My bad.`
` So, where is this lady I've kept waiting?"`
`"Huwat did you just saAaaAay!?!?"`
`All right! Satoko was in top form as well. Seemed she was all excited about being able to get everybody in the club together for the first time in a while.`
`"...Wooa~☆... Rika-chan... Ky-K-K-K-K... Kyute...~♪!!"`
`Rena let out an elated sigh.`
`It seemed that the real Lady had made her appearance.`
`"...Good evening, everyone.`
` Good evening to Keiichi, as well."`
`"Woo!!`
` Looking good!`
` You're looking sharp again this year!"`
`"K-Kyuutee...!`
` Gonna take you home~!!"`
`Rika-chan was wearing a shrine maiden outfit.`
` Yup.`
` Rena's little outburst was completely understandable!`
`"Rika-chan's clothes sure look like the real deal...!!`
` Is that a real shrine maiden outfit...?"`
`"My grandmother made them by hand.`
` They're quite authentic."`
`"Rika-chan has an important role to play at the end of the festival, so she's wearing this."`
`I see. Rika-chan was on the executive committee because she performed all the shrine maiden rituals for the festival.`
`"...My work is only during the finale of the festival...`
` so I can still play for a while."`
`"So we cannot afford to waste any time~!`
` Let us begin!!"`
`"Haoriiight!!"`
`It felt good to wander around the festival with just the five of us.`
`Mion called everyone over to a stand that caught her attention and proposed a rather odd competition.`
`"Takoyaki eating race~!!!`
` Everyone has to buy their own.`
` Ready? Go!!"`
`A standard in vendor stalls: the takoyaki stand!`
`What was especially standard for these kinds of events was the fact that they were simply balls of dough, takoyaki in name only!!`
`"It buUuUuUurns!!!"`
`"A-Are you okay, Keiichi-kun!?!?`
` Have some water!"`
`"My~ my~... Eating those scalding takoyaki whole is suicide!"`
`"I guess the trick is to buy the ready-made ones that have been left there for a while."`
`"...They really don't taste good."`
`The stall next to it was a shaved ice stand.`
`It was still a bit too early in the season for that, but right then it didn't matter!`
`"Let's do shaved ice this time!`
` It's a shaved ice eating race!!`
` Ready...`
` Go!!!"`
`"...Sh-Shaved ice eating race... I... I can't!!"`
`"As long as you can melt it a bit with your body heat, then...!!`
` It's...?!`
` It's so coOoOoold!!!"`
`"Not smart!`
` This old man ordered it with plenty of syrup!!`
` It'll melt quickly when it's mixed up!!"`
`Those stooges were too late!!`
`The moment they chose to tackle it head-on was their downfaaaAaaAll!!!`
`"Pheeew!!`
` FiniIIiiIIshed!!!"`
`"K-Kei-chan is done!?`
` Th-That was too fast...!!!!"`
`"It...`
` It couldn't be...`
` Keiichi-kun... you didn't... add water from the goldfish tank behind you, did you...!?"`
`"...That can't taste very good."`
`Next to that was another old favorite!`
`A cotton candy stand!!`
`"Why don't we do this one next!?`
` Of course, it's a speed eating conteeeest!!!"`
`"H-Hey, hey... How do you... eat cotton candy quickly?`
` How!?"`
`On Satoko's mark, Mion, Satoko, and I all compressed the cotton candy with our bare hands!!`
`The time it took to stick the whole thing in our mouths? ...Three seconds!!!`
`"I expected Satoko to figure it out, but I didn't think Kei-chan would too...!!"`
`"I can't have you treating me like I'm a newbie forever, can I!?"`
`"...It won't taste very good."`
`Rika-chan had also crushed it between her hands and stuck it into her mouth.`
`"This is probably the only place in Japan where people eat cotton candy like this..."`
`I think only Rena's cotton candy was happy with how it was eaten...`
`But... it felt like we'd end up doing stuff like "eat noodles through the nose contest!" or "human water pump at the goldfish scoop!" at the rate things were going...`
`"This old man will probably still win, too!"`
`"I am simply no match for Mion-san when it comes to eating repulsive things..."`
`"Yeah, seriously."`
`"What's up with you guys?`
` Are you telling me you don't want to have a Blue Hawaii-topped yakisoba-eating contest??"`
`Shake, shake! Both Satoko and I shook our heads in unison.`
`"U-Um...!`
` Can we have a game that doesn't involve food this time? Can we?"`
`Rena's proposal was a godsend. It was about time we played a different kind of game.`
`It also seemed like neither Rena nor Rika-chan were any good at speed-eating or gorging themselves.`
`"Okay Rena. I'll let you pick out the next game!!`
` Anything is fine!!"`
`"Well then, well then!`
` I'm going to be the judge!`
` Find kyute things on the festival grounds!!`
` You have one minute~!!"`
`"Fine by me!!`
` I know exactly what Rena likes!!!!"`
`"All right...`
` ...I think`
` I can win with 'that'!!!"`
`"Ready... Go!!!`
` ...Oh?`
` Why aren't Keiichi-kun and Rika-chan starting? Why not?"`
`Mion and Satoko dashed off madly, but Rika-chan and I calmly stayed right where we were.`
`"C-Could it be... You've already found it?? The kyute thing!"`
`"...We've already found it. ...Keiichi, too?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"What is it? What is it!? I can't wait!!"`
`Both Rika-chan and I stood motionless for those few moments before Mion and Satoko returned.`
`"This is probably the first time`
`......`
` We've gone head-to-head like this."`
`"...It will be the first."`
`"Rika-chan... You expect to win with 'that,' huh?"`
`"...I am a member of this club as well.`
` ...'Win by any means' is our society's third rule."`
`Rika-chan sneered to the best of her ability. ...You're on!!!`
`Both Mion and Satoko came back, each with their own plan of attack stuffed in their arms.`
`"Okay then, okay then, let's go in order!`
` Let's start with the club president, Mii-chan!!"`
`"Too bad, you guys! I'm ending this now!!!`
` This old man brought thiiiis!!"`
`Where did she get those?`
`...They were old diamond-shaped tin signs.`
`That's very understated... A little too understated, Mion...`
`I used to see those stuck up on barbed wire fences.`
`They were more nostalgic than 'kyute'...`
` ...Can you explain what part of that is 'kyute'?`
`But there were puffs of smoke noisily shooting out of Rena's ears and nose, almost like a steam train!!!!`
`I...`
` I didn't get it...`
`"I shall be up next!!!`
` It is this!!!!"`
`...It was the hand-drawn poster from the ladies' society's roasted corn stall.`
`It was a really bad sketch done by a housewife.`
`...An anthropomorphic roasted corn drawn without any sort of real plan. Its very existence invited a sense of sorrow to the viewer.`
`...Bweep!!`
`That was the sound of blood jetting out of Rena's nose...!!`
`It seemed... to have been rated higher than Mion's!!`
` ...I really didn't get it...`
` It feels like your artistic sense is a little avant-garde by about... five eons...`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` Those were nothing but mass-produced signs, after all!`
` They had no chance against something hand-drawn!!"`
`I couldn't even begin to follow the way those guys were thinking...`
`"...Then I will be next."`
`"Next is Rika-chan, is it?`
` What can you even do without anything!?"`
`Did you and Satoko both forget?`
` ...If Rika-chan felt like it, she could simply...`
`After moving back about ten yards, she began waddling up to Rena.`
`...Seeing that, both Mion and Satoko gasped!!`
`"O-O-O-O-Oh NoOoOo!!!"`
`Too late!!!!`
`Rika-chan tripped over nothing and lay motionless after falling down.`
`...Rena hurried over to her.`
`"R-Rika-chan, are you all right!? All right!?"`
`Rika-chan had a lump on her forehead and tears welled up in her eyes... Only her fingers peeked out from her sleeves...`
` (This was the vital part!!) The palms of her hands were covered by her sleeves...!!`
`She made just a single sound--`
` "...Meep."`
`"H-hau~~!!!!`
` Ky-K-K-Kyute, kyute!!!`
` Going to take you home~~!!!"`
`"I'd completely forgotten thaaat!!`
` The play that I personally had to use!!!"`
`Rena's face went completely red, her head bobbing back and forth with excitement. She embraced Rika-chan and began rubbing her cheek against her...!!!`
`"I'd expect no less from her...`
` Not a single element was overlooked.`
` Shrine maiden!`
` Brink of crying!`
` Meep!`
` It was perfect!!`
` A simple trip, transcended into pure moe...`
` Now this is what you call art!!"`
`"...Kei-chan has a pretty weird definition of 'art.'"`
`I'll just pretend the sharp sting of those words cutting through me like a razor was a figment of my imagination.`
`Rika-chan turned her gaze to me with a daunting smile as she was caressed by Rena, who was in full 'Kyute Mode.'`
`"...Now, Keiichi. ...Can you beat me?"`
`...That cold smile is frightening, Rika-chan.`
`It must just be my imagination, but I see a demon inside her sometimes...`
`"Kei-chan seems to have his own plan of attack...`
` ...I wonder what he's going to show her."`
`"I also wish to observe the play Keiichi-san will make."`
`"...Could it be...? Is Keiichi also going to give a performance?"`
`I basked in their pointed stares...`
`I pulled Rena, who gave no sign of cancelling out of 'Kyute Mode,' away from Rika-chan.`
`"Hau~!!`
` Kyute thing, kyute thing~...☆`
` Keiichi-kuun... Let go...!"`
`"I'll show you something even cuter, so just hold on for now."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh?`
` S-Something even... kyuter??"`
`"But it's a bit too crowded here.`
` Let's go back there."`
`Rena looked very surprised as I pulled her behind the shrine.`
`"...I cannot fathom what Keiichi-san could possibly be planning."`
`"Kei-chan, wouldn't stoop to... no, would he?"`
`"...Keep on fighting!`
` Yeah!"`
`After a bit, I returned.`
`...And a bit after that, so did Rena, dragging her feet.`
`"There's no way that scoundrel Kei-chan... did something... to innocent little Rena!?"`
`Mion and Satoko passed by me, heading straight to Rena.`
`"W-What, exactly, did he do to you!?"`
`For a moment, Rena was too dazed to realize someone was talking to her.`
`"Gasp!?`
` ...Hao, oh it's Mii-chan... hau..."`
`"Rena!`
` A-Are you all right!? Did Kei-chan do anything to you!?"`
`"N... No... H-He... didn't do anything strange to me... hau..."`
`"...This is quite severe...`
` Exactly what did Keiichi-san show you!?"`
`"...Um... It was so kyute... hau~.☆"`
`"Kyute!? What did he show you, Rena!?"`
`Rena let out a really long "Hau~."`
`Her eyes sparkled as she spoke...`
`"Kyute, so kyute☆... It was Keiichi-kun's...`
` furry little seal."`
`Whamp!`
` WhoOoOmp!!!`
`In the blink of an eye Mion and Satoko's elbows smashed into my face...!`
`"Huh?`
` Haoh!?`
` What?`
` What!?"`
`"...Sh-Showing Rena something so dirtyyyy~!!"`
`"You sick pervert~!!!`
` I shall have you beaten into oblivion!!!!"`
`"W-Wait, wait, you've got it all wrong!!!!!"`
`A dark, billowing aura flowed from Mion and Satoko!!`
`It was no good! Th-Th-They're gonna kill me!!!!`
`"Mii-chan!? I'm not sure what's going on... but you've got it all wrong!!`
` You see, Keiichi-kun had...!!"`
`"...It's a fur seal keychain."`
`Rika-chan stuck her hand into my pocket and pulled out my keychain.`
`"Ehh?"`
`"...He said he made it long ago for one of his summer school assignments.`
` He said he doesn't show it other often because it's embarrassing."`
`"Yeah...`
` So small and kyute.`
` ...He tried his best to make it. It's so wonderful...☆"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` I'd expect no less from Mion-san~!`
` You misconstrue things in the wildest ways."`
`They slung insults at each other and looked like they were ready to tear into each other at any second!`
`...I beg of you.`
`...If I'm in the clear, would you mind getting off of me...?`
`We were interrupted by the flash of a camera.`
`"Hey, guys.`
` You all seem energetic, as usual!"`
`It was Tomitake-san.`
`As I lay crumpled on the ground, Mion and Satoko continued to bicker above me.`
`Rika-chan was patting me on the head and Rena was still in Kyute Mode...`
`...It was probably quite a lively scene...`
`"It's a fine evening, indeed! Although it's rather poor etiquette to photograph a lady without her permission!!"`
`"That's right.`
` At least you don't really need Satoko's permission.`
` Hurrngh!?!?"`
`Satoko dug her heel into me!!`
`"Good evening.`
` ...Ah. You're heading back tomorrow,`
` aren't you?`
` Were you able to take lots of good photos?"`
`"Yes, thanks for asking.`
` I got plenty of good shots."`
`"Tonight's the last we can see ol' Tomitake-sama, isn't it~!?`
` It's such a shame.☆`
` Hurry up and have your major breakout soon~!"`
`"J-Just as rude as ever, aren't you...!`
` I really am sad I won't be able to hear that voice of yours for almost half a year."`
`"Be sure to have as much fun as you can tonight.`
` You'll be back in Tokyo tomorrow, after all!"`
`"...That's true.`
` It will be another six months...`
` until I can enjoy another night where I can see the stars."`
`Tomitake-san looked up at the night sky cheerfully.`
`At that moment, even though he was smiling, I sensed a bit of sadness.`
`"Why don't you move here, Tomitake-san?`
` In Hinamizawa."`
`Tomitake-san was speechless.`
`"It's not very convenient here.`
` No shops.`
` Or recreational spots... There might not be anything really here, but you know..."`
`Everyone knew what I was trying to say.`
`...Tomitake-san was also well aware.`
`So Rena, Mion,`
` Satoko, and Rika-chan...`
` none of them butted in.`
`"I've only been here for less than a month, so I don't really know everything about it."`
`Normally I'm a really talkative guy, but in situations like this I'm at a loss for words.`
`Even though all this was happening in such a boisterous setting,`
` it felt like all the background noise was fading into the distance.`
`"This place is probably...!"`
`Tomitake-san rested his hand on me gently, silencing me.`
`"...Thank you.`
` Keiichi-kun.`
` Mion-chan and Rena-chan,`
` Satoko-chan and Rika-chan."`
`Tomitake-san's smile was so slight it looked as if it was going to crumble at any minute, but it was warm.`
`"I also think it would be great... if I could live here."`
`Those might have been cruel words coming from a kid who didn't need to worry about working to feed himself.`
`A hand touched my back.`
`...It was Rena.`
`"Keiichi-kun. ...You shouldn't pick on adults. It's not nice."`
`The background clamor of the festival returned.`
`"We won't be seeing him for a while, after all!`
` We need to make sure Tomitake-san also enjoys tonight!"`
`When Rena smiled, the mood instantly got brighter.`
`"That's true. I think I'll do just that."`
`"Ah!`
` Hey, Mii-chan!!`
` How about it!?`
` Can we let Tomitake-san in on our club activities!?"`
`That's a great idea!!`
` ...Or so I thought, but Mion had a snobbish look on her face.`
`"...One of the requirements for membership is residence in Hinamizawa, you see."`
`"Come on, Mii-chan... Just for today, don't be mean..."`
`"Well, he does come around often every year.  I'll make him an honorary citizen!!"`
`"Whoa!! Yaay!!!"`
`"Now then!`
` I wonder if this aged fellow, well past his prime, will be a match for me!"`
`"...Let's have him show us the wisdom of a mature adult."`
`"Heh heh! Can you keep up with us young 'uns?"`
`Tomitake-san stepped back slightly at our audacious grins.`
`"I, Mion Sonozaki, club president, do hereby authorize Honorary Citizen Tomitake's entry into our club!!"`
`Her words were quickly drowned out by our cheers.`
`"Wh-What do you mean by club...!?"`
`"What our club does, you see... In order to cope with our complicated society, we perform various activities with various rules. Sometimes they are in your favor...`
` ...and sometimes they work against you...!!"`
`"...I'm pretty weak... so I'd prefer you not single me out. Let's try to get along."`
`"If you wish to mock our childish games, then this will be the perfect opportunity!"`
`"...So, it's a club where we play games together."`
`Of course Rika-chan was the only one to give an answer that made sense.`
`"All right! Just what I wanted.`
` I'll take you up on that challenge!`
` Don't be too rough on me, my mentors!"`
`Tomitake-san got riled up and did a victory pose like he was ten years younger!`
`That's perfect!!`
`We continued walking through the festival with Mion in the front. Now we looked like a family of six.`
`It had some intensity to it!`
`"Same rules as always! The loser will, of course, be subject to a penalty!!"`
`Tomitake-san was a bit surprised, but to us it was just the same as always.`
`...Regardless of how terrible a penalty it was,`
`"'Just don't lose!'"`
`Rena was also brimming with determination.`
`She didn't have any intention of losing.`
`"That's true!!"`
`I tousled Rena's hair to lighten the mood. She giggled to hide her embarrassment.`
`"I see... This is what it means to feel like a kid again."`
`Tomitake-san whispered that to nobody in particular.`
`At that moment, we heard an old man call out in a strong voice.`
`Looking over, I realized it was the man Mion had greeted right before the festival.`
`"You're here.`
` Little Miss Sonozaki! Seems you brought quite the crowd."`
`"We came to eradicate your entire stall!!"`
`His stall was a shooting gallery.`
`It was the usual setup where you had to knock down the prize you wanted with a cork gun.`
`"The rules are simple!!`
` Three shots! The winner is whoever gets the biggest prize!!"`
`Everybody shouted their agreement.`
`There was no need to consider how to win, since the condition for victory was simply size.`
`The biggest prize at the stall... It went without question.`
` It was that one, wasn't it...!?`
`"Whoa... Th... That teddy bear... K-Kyute...☆"`
`Rena was gazing longingly at a large stuffed animal.`
`It was intentionally placed on an unsteady platform, so it was possible to get it if you hit the right spot!`
`"...It's magnificently set up to make someone think that."`
`"Not bad, Keiichi-san.`
` I figured you would see through this scam instantly."`
`"Hmm. The most logical course of action would be to aim for some candy or a doll."`
`The intent analysis had already begun.`
`In this club, you'll get eaten alive if you don't come prepared.`
`Everything hinges on what plan you can come up with before the main event...!!!`
`At some point a large crowd had gathered around us, making a big fuss.`
`There was this much of a following for our club's infamous event!?`
`"...Knocking that bear down ensures a win."`
`"Only three shots.`
` To use them all just trying... That'd be rough."`
`"Hey!`
` I have other customers waiting, you know!!`
` Who's up first!?"`
`"The first one has the advantage of being able to aim for the easier prizes... but it's dangerous to compete without knowing the gun's quirks."`
`Tomitake-san's take on the situation was pretty good.`
` He gets what our club is about...!`
`"Well then, to be fair... How about using rock-paper-scissors to decide? How about it!?"`
`"That's really the only way!`
` Rock, paper, scissors!!!!"`
`After a couple of matches, it ended up with Mion being first.`
`"I didn't want to end up first... Ah well, I'll just think of it as a handicap. Gramps!! Gun!!"`
`"Here yah go!!"`
`When the shooting range guy handed her a rifle, Mion looked it over intently.`
`She didn't forget to check the cork bullet, either.`
`"Okay.`
` ...This gun is brand new, isn't it?`
` No faults. Not bad!!"`
`Mion raised the gun in one swift motion!!`
`It was completely different from her careful inspection. She was shooting from the hip!!`
`Fire!`
` Reload.`
` ...Fire!`
` Reload.`
` ...Fire!!!`
`Flop.`
`...Flop, flop.`
`...Three candy boxes fell, one after the other.`
`A big haul!!`
`The crowd paused in a moment of awe and then erupted in cheers.`
`"""Whoaaaaa!!!`
` Awesooooome!!!!"""`
`"Th... That was quite good...!!!"`
`Tomitake-san was at a loss for words after seeing such shooting prowess.`
`"A... Amazing, Mii-chan!!`
` Three! Three!!!"`
`Her accuracy was incredible... Her choice of targets wasn't bad either.`
`The three Mion had gone after were fairly large and pretty easy to knock over. They were all targets with very high return on investment...!`
`"Who's up next?`
` Satoko?`
` ...Careful. The bullets are light."`
`Next was Satoko.`
`The rifle looked a bit big for her lithe body, but it didn't seem like she had any problem with the weight.`
`"Of course`
` ...`
`I shall aim for the grand prize!!"`
`She proclaimed that she was going after the teddy bear!`
`Damn Satoko! Such a bold move!`
`"The moment she knocks it over, she's guaranteed to be in first!"`
`"Good luck, Satoko-chan~!!"`
`Satoko was the opposite of Mion. She aimed at the target quite carefully... and squeezed the trigger!`
`"...Bah. These bullets are too light...!"`
`The first two bullets struck the bear in the torso, but it only shifted a bit.`
`...You need to aim higher towards the head or it won't work...!`
`Satoko's third bullet wasn't aimed at the bear, but at the candy box below its arm.`
`"I hate to say it, but it appears the bear is just too much for me...!"`
`She went boldly after the big catch, but since she switched over to less impressive prey at the last second, the crowd only gave a strained laugh.`
`Were they laughing because she lacked the courage?`
`...These fools know nothing!!`
`"A fine attempt, Satoko. You've gotten better!"`
`The palm of Mion's outstretched hand went "pomf!" as it tapped down lightly on Satoko.`
`She appeared to just be talking hot air, but this was actually completely calculated!`
`Damn that Satoko! Just to avoid being in last place, she dared to switch over to an easy target...!`
`Without shame or honor!!`
` Magnificent...`
`"I'll allow you to take the bear, Rena-san.`
` I pray for your victory!"`
`"Okay, okay!`
` Thanks so much, Satoko-chan.☆`
` ...Hau~ Mr. Bear sho kyute!!"`
`Rena was up next.`
`She couldn't hit the broadside of a barn as regular Rena, but she said that bear was 'kyute'!`
`"I wonder how Rena-chan will do.`
` ...I hope she's able to hit at least one."`
`"You're underestimating Rena, Tomitake-san...`
` ...`
` Heh."`
`It's Rena, you know?`
`It's Rena Ryuugu, you know!?`
`If it was to get that teddy bear...`
`"""Whoaaaaah!!!"""`
`Tomitake-san wheeled around to see what all the commotion the spectators were making was about!`
`If it was to get that bear... she'd be able to shoot through a pinhole!`
`The one known as Rena Ryuugu could do it!!!!`
`"Sh-Sh-Shaking, it's shaking... hau... Kyute!!!"`
`Rena couldn't hide her excitement over the bear's slow rocking...! Now Rena couldn't lose!!`
`"Not bad, Rena-san...!!`
` The less collected you become..."`
`"The stronger you get!!!"`
`"""Whooooaaa!!!!"""`
`Another big cheer!`
`Rena's bullet hit the bear's forehead again!!`
` Not enough. The bear seemed to wobble more than before.`
`"...But it might not be possible."`
`"Y-You never know!`
` With Rena-chan's skill, it might be...!!"`
`While Tomitake-san was just as excited as the crowd, Rika-chan's analysis was not swayed by emotion.`
`If Rena had ten more shots, then she could surely knock it over.`
`...`
`But... with just one more... No matter how you looked at it`
`...`
` No go!`
`"""OwWwwWw-----!!!!"""`
`The crowd let out a dejected groan...`
`She had shot it right in the forehead three times...`
`It was a bit late, but they gave her a good round of applause for the attempt.`
`"...Hau... Mr. Bear... take him home... hau..."`
`She should be praised for her valor, but she had no trophies to show for it.`
`...Then, at that moment, the old man flicked one of the candy boxes with his finger and handed it to Rena.`
`"This's fer you, little lady."`
`"...Huh? ...You're giving this to...`
` to me? Hau..."`
`"The gods wouldn't forgive me if I let you go home empty-handed after such a display!"`
`There was another shower of applause!`
`Rena turned bright red and I pulled her back over to us by her hand.`
`"You did a good job!`
` Your 'Kyute Mode' really surprised me!"`
`"...Hau... I really wanted Mr. Bear... Wah..."`
`It was easy to see that it only needed a little more to be knocked over.`
`Rena had done quite a lot for me.`
` I still needed to pay her back for that delicious picnic.`
`"All right! Then I'll..."`
` "I'll get it and give it to you."`
`Wuhaaaat!?!?`
`Tomitake-san had stolen the words right out of my mouth!`
`"Okay! Okay!`
` Please, Tomitake-san!!`
` Good luck~!!"`
`D-D-Damn you, old man Tomitakeee!!`
` Stealing the good parts for yourself...!!`
`A small hand stretched over and fell gently on my head just before I was overcome with frustration.`
`"...You keep on fighting too, Keiichi,`
` okay?"`
`Tomitake-san carefully studied the bear.`
`...Setting his sights, he shouldered the rifle while holding the other two shots in his hand.`
`"Hm!?`
` Why is he doing that!?"`
`"...Yes, no doubt!!`
` Tomitake-san is aiming for...!"`
`Pwop!`
`Pwop!`
`Pwop!!`
` The time between shots was short!!`
`It was meaningless to shoot again once it stopped shaking!!`
` So Tomitake-san  was relying on rapid fire to win the battle!!!`
`It was visibly wobbling much more than it ever had before...!`
`...But that was all...`
` It still didn't fall over.`
`"Hau~~~... T-Too bad..."`
`All of Rena's momentary expectation from watching it sway violently turned into a dejected sigh.`
`"...Hmm~... I really thought it would work...!!"`
`"Oh ho ho!`
` It seems that, since you're a man, you will not be receiving any candy!"`
`That was it!`
` It meant Tomitake-san had no spoils of war!`
`"So both Kei-chan and Rika-chan can just shoot down a sure, easy prize and avoid being dead last."`
`"Avoid being the loser, huh.`
` ...`
`Oh, sorry about that."`
`"It's your turn next, Keiichi-kun. Best of luck!"`
`I was the fifth shooter.`
`I took the rifle from Tomitake-san.`
`If I took the ruthless route, as Mion had suggested, then I'd go for something insignificant.`
` ...Except...!!`
`When I picked up the rifle, I definitely got a feeling from it.`
` ...It was... burning passion!!`
`Passed down to me by Tomitake-san.`
`The regret of not being man enough to fell the bear that Rena wanted...!!`
`Yes, that's right.`
` If I didn't aim for the bear`
`...`
` Then I wouldn't be a man!!`
`"After all, that was my promise...`
` to Rena."`
`"...Huh ...huh?`
` ...What... promise? What?"`
`"To shoot down that bear.`
` ...Then give it to Rena. That one."`
`"Uh... uh... You mean... hau..."`
`The crowd went wild when they saw our conversation!`
`"""Whoooooo!!`
` Cool, onii-chan!!`
` Show us what you've got!!!!"""`
`Th-That's not it, fine men of the crowd!`
`...If I didn't do this... then Rena might mug the old man running the stall on his way home...!!`
`No! That's not it! That's not it at all!`
`Why can't I just express my honest feelings!?`
`"Keiichi-san surely talks the talk.`
` ...But how do you actually intend to bring down the bear?"`
`"...Rena and Tomitake-san's shots did make it tilt a bit... but I think finishing the job will be difficult."`
`"...Keiichii-kun..."`
`"If only there was some way to shoot faster... I'd be able to pile more power on the sway from each hit...!"`
`"Good luck! Keiichi-kun!!`
`After taking two deep breaths, I shouted over to the guy.`
`"Two more rifles."`
`Huh!?`
` The crowd murmured amongst themselves.`
`"I wonder what Keiichi-san is up to...`
` One person can't handle three rifles at once!!"`
`"I get it...`
` Nice thinking, Kei-chan!!"`
`Mion was able to figure it out magnificently!`
`"Basically, what was taking the most time was reloading the shot."`
`"Th-That's right...!`
` Then... by putting three pre-loaded rifles next to each other...!"`
`Tomitake-san went silent, peering at me and the bear through his lens.`
`His photographer's blood predicted a miracle will occur!`
`And then the crowd finally picked up on what I was planning!`
`They let out a great cheer!`
` They chanted my name, Keiichi!!!`
`Rapid fire is the key!`
` If I miss, all is for naught!!`
`...Phueeeeeew...`
`After letting out a deep breath... I paused.`
` Relax...`
`NOW!`
`That moment... It felt like time itself had stopped.`
`I felt like I could see the trajectory of the bullets.`
`Hit it...`
` and`
`...`
` knock it down!`
`The first shot hit the bear on its head.`
` The second...`
` ...`
` The third...`
` !!!`
`The bear swayed hard!!`
` And then...!`
`"Who-Whooooo!!`
` Yeaaaaaah!!!!"`
`"""oOOooOOOoOoOO!!!!"""`
`The cheers began before the stuffed animal even finished falling off the shelf.`
`The guy caught it before it hit the ground and tossed it over to me.`
`"...You actually knocked it over.`
` You got me!!"`
`"Amazing! Congratulations, Keiichi-kun!!"`
`"Keiichi-san has finally learned how to use his head!!`
` I see you in a slightly better light now!!"`
`"I didn't do it all by myself. Everyone hit it, and those small bits together brought it down.`
` ...This trophy belongs to all of us!!!"`
`"Right! This is from all of us working together~!!"`
`"...Mii didn't hit it a single time."`
`"...Urk."`
`After holding up the teddy bear like it was a championship trophy, I handed it to Rena.`
`"Here.`
` This is from me... No, from everyone.`
` Thanks for always making your delicious lunches."`
`Rena, thinking she was never actually going to get it, was momentarily speechless.`
`"I-I can't, Keiichi-kun... This is everyone's, after all... hau~."`
`"In that case, I was the one who knocked it down!`
` And it's mine!`
` It's mine, so I'm giving it to Rena!"`
`I pushed the stuffed animal towards her again.`
` ...This time, she embraced and accepted it.`
`"You've watched out for me ever since I moved here, after all.`
` I'm really grateful, you see...`
` Thanks a lot!!"`
`"...H-Hau~~!!`
` Keiichii-kuun!!`
` Thanks so much~~☆!"`
`Rena dove at me.`
`Mion told me a few days later that Rena kissed me, but I didn't realize it during all the excitement at the time.`
`I remembered what I was trying to say to Tomitake-san earlier.`
`There really isn't much of anything here.`
`...But there are lots of things you can't find anywhere else.`
`I gained a lot from coming to Hinamizawa.`
` ...Especially at that moment.`
`The crowd's cheers echoed on and on.`
`From the altar set up in front of the shrine, the drums sounded with a booming echo.`
`It was the finale of the festival.`
`"...I'll be going off ahead, then."`
`"Uh oh!`
` I need to go and get myself a good spot, too.`
` ...Well then everyone, see you in a bit."`
`Both Rika-chan and Tomitake-san gave their farewells and disappeared into the crowd.`
`"I wish both of you the best in your endeavors~!!`
` Now...`
` Shall we be off?"`
`"Yeah, might as well go see Rika-chan's charming figure.`
` Let's go!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Huh? Where's Rena?`
` ...Wh-What are you doing??"`
`"K-K-Keiichi-ku~n!`
` Mii-cha~n... Save me~...!"`
`Since she was carrying such a ridiculously large stuffed animal, she was being carried by the flow of people.`
`"What is she doing...`
` She must have her hands full taking care of that bear..."`
`"So I'll leave Rena in your care, Kei-chan.`
` I have my hands full taking care of Satoko."`
`"Who would want to be looked after by you, Mion-san~!?`
` Ouch! Please don't pull on my arm~...!"`
`Before losing sight of Mion, I grabbed the back of Rena's collar.`
`"K-K-Keiichi-kun... Not there... don't grab me there...!"`
`"Always so bossy.`
` Where can I grab then?"`
`"...Uh... um... Hau..."`
`I didn't feel ashamed at all. Rena was ashamed enough for the both of us.`
`I grabbed onto Rena's hand and dashed after Mion and the others.`
`"We're gonna be late.`
` Let's hurry up!"`
`"...Y-Yeah...!"`
`I hadn't realized Rena's hand was so delicate...`
` ...Maybe she needed a bit more exercise and nutrition?`
`...That wasn't what I meant! Not at all!!`
`My ears burned.`
`I tried to keep calm. I repeated the phrase "Keep it together, Keiichi Maebara" in my mind, but it didn't look like I would be able to anytime soon.`
`I really didn't want Rena to see my face right then, so I pushed onwards, dragging her along without looking back even once.`
`There was already a huge group of people gathered at the altar in front of the shrine.`
`The fire at the altar made it as bright as midday and just as hot.`
`There was a pile of futons warded with sanctified rope in front of the altar.`
`Come to think of it, they did say it was a festival where they did something with the cotton in futons.`
`"Keiichi-san!`
` Rena-san~!`
` We're over here~!!"`
`Satoko waved her hand from the front row.`
`"Ah! Sorry, sorry!"`
`Making our way through the mass of people, we reached the spot they'd saved.`
`"How was it? Were you able to have a little bit of excitement with Rena~?"`
`"Y-Y-You punk! So that's what your plan was!?!?"`
`Instead of replying, Mion gave us a perverse grin.`
`"How was it, Rena?`
` Was Kei-chan's hand bigger than you thought it would be~?"`
`"Ha... Ha`
`o~..."`
`Rena turned bright red, puffs of steam shooting out of her.`
`I heard something slice through the air and turned around to see Mion on the ground with a welt on her face.`
`"...Mion... When... were you hit...?"`
`"Between the 'ha' and 'o' of her hau~ I...`
` think..."`
`"Rena...`
` It's not good to punch your friends to hide your embarrassment..."`
`"I-I didn't hit her... W-Wh-whatever... hau."`
`Thump!! The thunderous beat of the drum echoed, silencing the crowd.`
`"You must all be quiet!! It's beginning!!"`
`It was a solemn ritual.`
`Rika-chan entered dressed as a shrine maiden, followed by members of the municipal committee.`
`The elders all looked at Rika-chan and clasped their hands in praise.`
`The only thing allowed to disturb the profound silence was the flash from Tomitake-san's camera.`
`"What's the big thing Rika-chan is holding?"`
`"A hoe that's used for this festival.`
` It's a sacred farming tool that only the shrine maiden may touch."`
`It was an awkward shape for a piece of farm equipment. Not uncommon for something used in rituals.`
`After reciting a Shinto prayer, Rika-chan approached the pile of futons gathered at the altar.`
`She swung the hoe skillfully, ploughing it into the futons.`
`Each and every little movement of this performance probably had to be done in a certain way...`
`Without a doubt, this was a ritual.`
`"What's next?`
` Airing out futons?"`
`"She's purifying the futons, which sacrificially absorbed winter's illnesses for those using them."`
`"So when Kei-chan said 'airing out futons,' he wasn't completely wrong."`
`Rika-chan's face was already dripping with sweat.`
`...That hoe was probably really heavy.`
`She staggered side-to-side with the momentum of each swing.`
`Satoko looked on, silently lending her support...`
`"...Worried?"`
`"Rika practiced every single day with a mochi hammer...`
` ...She will certainly prevail."`
`Satoko's hands were sweaty, and whenever Rika-chan started to sway a little, she held her breath.`
`"...Why wasn't Mion a candidate to be the shrine maiden?`
` ...It feels wrong, having Rika-chan swing around something so heavy."`
`"I'd do it if they asked me, you know...`
` And well...`
` it's not something just anyone could do."`
`"That's true.`
` Shrine maidens need to be pure, after all.`
` ...Ghrnk...!!"`
`Mion drove her elbow into my side!!`
`With the thud of the big drum, Rika-chan gave a solemn bow and descended from the altar.`
`...That triggered a round of generous applause.`
`After the Shinto priests had raised up the cleansed futons like a portable altar, all the spectators stood up.`
` Following after the priests, we all marched on at a moderate pace.`
`They descended the shrine's giant stairs in a line.`
`"What's happening now?`
` Washing the futons in the river?"`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Watanagashi means setting cotton adrift, you know."`
`The procession continued right up to the bank of the stream.`
`A fire was stoked high and it was bright as day here, too.`
`People started crowding around it and clamoring.`
`"All right, get in line.`
` Line up, Keiichi-kun."`
`...I wondered what was up.`
`Maybe we'd get some holy wine?`
` Red and white bean buns?`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` It's not food.`
` I said it was`
` cotton."`
`Ah, but of course.`
` They didn't call it the Watanagashi for nothing.`
` I finally understood.`
`The municipal committee members pulled out the cotton from inside the futons and balled it up like mochi, handing it out to people.`
`Rena dove into the line and brought out some for me as well.`
`We then proceeded to the bank of the stream.`
`"Since it's your first time, Keiichi-kun, just copy what I do."`
`She held the cotton in her right hand and, waving her hand as if to purify it, she touched it to her forehead, chest, navel, and both thighs.`
`"You do this three times, and silently give thanks to Oyashiro-sama."`
`"Oyashiro-sama? What's that? The name of the shrine's god?"`
`"Yes. It's the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.`
` It brings about both miracles and curses!`
` So you must be sure to show respect."`
`That sounded like a pretty frightening god.`
` But, well, when in Rome...`
`I was officially a resident of Hinamizawa now, after all.`
`Doing as Rena showed me, I touched the cotton over myself three times.`
`Thank you, Oyashiro-sama... Thank you, Oyashiro-sama... Oyashiro-sama...`
`"This way, all the evil that possesses you is sucked out by the cotton.`
` ...Then you let it gently drift away on the stream, and you're done."`
`Together, Rena and I set our pieces of cotton afloat on the surface of the water.`
`The flowers of cotton blooming in the water had sucked out all the bad illnesses from Hinamizawa and drifted off, disappearing into the distance.`
`It was wonderful, like those floating lantern festivals I'd seen on TV. The best part, though, was feeling like this rite of passage had made me a true resident of Hinamizawa.`
