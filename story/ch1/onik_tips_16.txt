`"Let's cut to the chase... is there a drug that causes someone to kill themselves?"`
`"Not directly, no."`
`"That's quite a roundabout response.`
` You mean that there's one that does it indirectly?"`
`"It's possible to induce a suicidal mental state,`
` is what I mean."`
`"...That's hard to say.`
` What would 'a suicidal mental state' be?"`
`"Like a person with a serious bipolar disorder.`
` It's believed that people are most likely to attempt suicide when swinging from depression to mania."`
`Clinical depression and bipolar disorder are different.`
`Clinical depression indicates a prolonged state of depression,`
` whereas bipolar disorder is characterized by a passive depressed state accompanied by a very active manic state.`
`"Individuals with clinical depression suffer from low self-esteem and are quite pessimistic,`
` but rarely commit suicide.`
` They don't have the willpower to commit suicide. `
`Nor does mania on its own lead to suicide.`
` That has an opposite effect, filling the person with confidence and making them feel as though they're walking on air.`
` Thus, they do not commit suicide."`
`"...That's interesting.`
` Neither state causes suicide, but when the condition changes, they might do so?"`
`"There is a desire to commit suicide when in a state of depression, but they do not have the willpower to commit such a formidable act.`
` But when they enter mania, they gain a burst of willpower and their body moves as they desire."`
`"I see!`
` So it means they gain the willpower to commit suicide."`
`"That's how it goes.`
` That's why patients are given sedatives during that time to keep them from acting on their impulses."`
`"...Then was Tomitake bipolar?"`
`"People who suffer from bipolar disorder generally commit suicide by more 'civilized' means.`
` Like, say hanging, or jumping off a building.`
` Self-harm as though going through withdrawal is completely different!"`
`"Tomitake's death wasn't civilized...`
`So one would think it was caused by some foreign substance.`
` As I said from the start: tell me of a drug that causes someone to commit suicide."`
`"There are reports that methamphetamine overdoses produce a condition that resembles bipolar disorder. It's a stimulant.`
`...Barbiturate overdoses are also reported to cause erratic behavior. That's a sleep aid."`
`"There were no signs of stimulants.`
` Are there any other possibilities?"`
`"All I can think of is that it's some sort of illness.`
`Something like Graves' disease, which affects the thyroid, and is known to cause symptoms that resemble bipolar disorder.`
` But Graves' disease has many characteristic symptoms of its own.`
` The deceased exhibited none of them."`
`"I wonder, is there something that could happen more spontaneously?`
` Something that fits this case and would cause someone to want to commit suicide all of a sudden."`
`"Are you familiar with organic mental disorders?`
` In short, it's a condition where the brain is out of whack due to physical injury or illness.`
`It can be caused by drugs, but it can also be caused by physical trauma, encephalitis, a stroke, or even tumors."`
`"Basically, even without a drug, one can succumb to an irregular mental state."`
`"The deceased was surrounded after being chased, and his life was in danger, right?`
`All that stress could have messed with his brain chemistry, he could have hit his head, and those factors combined might have caused him to mutilate himself. It's a possibility."`
`"...Could you explain it to me in simpler terms...?"`
`"Bwah ha ha!`
` Basically, he knocked his noggin in the brawl and that made him go haywire."`
`"Nahahahahahahah!!!`
` Guess this means the assailants didn't have any intent to kill.`
` They smacked him hoping to nick some change, and just happened to hit a bad place!"`
`The two plump men laughed hoarsely.`
`"...But of course, it's not like that."`
`"Ahem.`
` Undoubtedly..."`
`"Whether it was habitual drug use, or something mental, the deceased's background holds the key.`
` How's your investigation going?"`
`"Oh my goodness, look at the time!`
` I need to get back soon or Kuma-chan will get angry with me."`
`"Yeah!`
` Good luck!`
` Best wishes!"`
`"Best wishes!"`
