`This was the first time I'd ever woke with such clarity.`
`It was 5:59, just moments before my alarm would go off.`
` ...I was amazed at the precision of my internal clock.`
`I had made preparations for the next day of school before I went to bed.`
`I changed quickly and descended to the deserted lower floor.`
`It appeared that my mom was still asleep.`
` ...Neither breakfast nor lunch was ready.`
`Yesterday, I just unilaterally declared that I would be leaving early today, so it couldn't be helped.`
`I slathered jam on some bread and topped it with instant cocoa. Just as I was finishing up breakfast, Mom rose groggily from her slumber.`
`"...My, Keiichi, you're up early.`
` Is there some sort of school event?"`
`"Not really."`
`Answering bluntly, I picked up my bag and stood after stuffing two slices of bread down my throat.`
`"You're leaving already?`
` What about lunch?`
` If you don't wait a bit, I can't make it."`
`If I waited for her to make my lunch, then it would end up being the same time as usual.`
`If I did that, it would raise the chances of me running into Rena and Mion on the way.`
`Yes. From today onwards, I was going to go to school alone.`
`"I'll be fine for today."`
`"Then what will you do for lunch?"`
`"I'll slip out and buy some bread or something at the store."`
`"Really? ...Then here's some lunch money.`
` Be sure to bring me back the receipt."`
`I took the thousand-yen bill from Mom and slipped it into my pocket.`
`"It's pretty early, is Rena-chan up this early as well...?"`
`"No, just me."`
`"...Did you tell Rena-chan that you're leaving early?"`
`...I have no reason to tell her every little detail, now do I...?`
`Finding it difficult answering the onslaught of questions, I made an annoyed face.`
`"Tell Rena that I went ahead when she comes."`
`"H-Hey, Keiichi!? Wait...!"`
`It's not that I didn't trust my parents...`
` I just couldn't rely on them.`
`They couldn't help me... I could only hope that they didn't get involved.`
` It was safer that way.`
`My mom's annoying voice was cut off by the slam of the door.`
`For the first time since I moved here,  I headed down the road to school alone.`
`Up until now, I had always walked down the same path at the same time each day.`
`So I always met with the same people at the same places.`
`But today was different.`
`I didn't meet the people I would normally and nobody was at the places where I would have normally met them.`
`Of course, Rena wasn't in the spot where we usually met and there wasn't anyone at the spot where we would have met up with Mion.`
`The length of the trees' shadows, the morning air, and the brightness of the sun... It was a completely different type of morning from what I was used to.`
`Without a doubt, it felt strange.`
`It left me with the impression that... I had destroyed the illusion Hinamizawa had set up for me before it had enough time to prepare all of the props needed to deceive me.`
`"...Myyy, Keiichi-kun.`
` You're so early today. Is everyone meeting early this morning?"`
`The person who called out to me was someone we always passed by as they were taking a walk along the edge of the fields.`
`...Their name was... uhh... I forgot.`
` ...Of course, this wasn't the spot where we usually passed each other.`
`"I woke up early today... so I thought it would be a good change of pace.`
` That's all."`
`I threw out a random excuse.`
`"What about Rena-chan and Mion-chan?`
` Are you by yourself today?"`
`"Well... yeah..."`
`I was being asked the same type of questions my mom was asking.`
`So I answered them in the same uninteresting, vague manner.`
`...It wasn't funny being asked where Rena was each time I passed by someone.`
`But maybe it was to be expected.`
`...It was because for so long, we were always together so amicably.`
`Even I felt that if I let my guard down, we could still be frie-`
` ...`
`...Stop it, Keiichi.`
` Don't think about that anymore.`
`You spent all day yesterday thinking about how dangerous it was to go soft, didn't you...?`
`Bebebeeeep!!!`
`A car horn blared from out of nowhere.`
`Even though I was walking, lost in thought, that horn was way too close.`
`A mechanical behemoth barreled at me from behind, catching me completely off guard.`
`By the time I turned around, the van's hulking chassis was almost on top of me.`
`I'd seen plenty of cars veer to the opposite shoulder to avoid pedestrians, but this car was doing the opposite.`
`It felt like...`
` It felt like there was somebody on the opposite shoulder and the van was swerving in my direction to avoid them.`
`That blissfully ignorant train of thought delayed me from realizing something much, much more important.`
`That large mass was hurtling right at me.`
` ...Was it going to hit me!?!?`
`The inside of my head instantly flooded with a painfully cold liquid!!`
`In that moment... the scene before me—no, time itself—had frozen.`
`In the silence of that frozen moment, I compared the van—so close that I had no way to dodge it—and my body, the upper half twisted awkwardly in order to look behind me.`
`There was no way I could dive out of the way in my current position...`
`If I lost focus now, this moment would unpause, and I would probably be plowed over, caught in this silly pose.`
`Bend my upper body over towards the paddy by the side of the road.`
`...If I bent far enough, I'd get away with just being hit by the side-view mirror...!`
`As soon as the thought crossed my mind, the temporal stasis was shattered by the deafening sound of the van.`
`The side mirror struck my shoulder, sending me spinning off through the air like a top, locked in my contorted position...!!`
`Kesplash!!!`
`Sent tumbling through the air, I crashed into the muddy paddy by the side of the road.`
`My entire body was soiled and drenched...!!`
`But the choice I had made in that instant was unmistakably for the best.`
`I was covered in mud, but when the alternative was being hit by the car, it was the closest I could be to being unscathed.`
`Rising out from the paddy, I had enough in me to glare over at the stopped van and yell profanities at the driver.`
`I'm not sure if he was able to see me, but the van sped off suddenly.`
`"Wait, damn it!!`
` This... was what they call a hit-and-run, wasn't it!?"`
`I couldn't help but continue yelling out profanities.`
`The disgrace from being covered in mud hurt me more than any physical wounds.`
`I slogged through the muddy paddy and made my way back onto the road.`
`"This is a crime, God damn it...!!"`
`Shit!! I'll track you down and sue you!!`
` If I go looking for a van, I'm sure to find it in this little village...!!`
`The path I was on had rice paddies on either side, and it had become so narrow that one car could barely fit through.`
`It wasn't a place you could tear full speed down in a car, let alone pass by pedestrians.`
`Not only was it a narrow road, but the car just now was closer to my side of the road than the other when it went past me...`
`Even as I cursed, I was desperately trying to suppress the dark cloud roiling up within me.`
`This wasn't just a hit and run...`
` That car just now...`
` was trying to run me over, wasn't it...?`
`Thinking back... I did feel like there had been a car creeping up on me slowly for a while.`
`That's right. As soon as I'd parted ways with that person taking a walk... I had that feeling the whole time.`
`If it had wanted to pass me, then it had no shortage of chances.`
`Normally, I would have felt suspicious and turned around sooner.`
`But... I was lost in thought and now was kicking myself for not realizing it was there sooner.`
`And then... when the path became narrow and there was no one else in sight... he floored it...`
`If I had hesitated for even a moment... the result would have been no laughing matter.`
`As the adrenaline rush from nearly being run over subsided... and the realization of just how terrifying the preceding events were, sunk in.`
`There was no doubt about it. That van was intentionally trying to hit me...`
`A cold, viscous sweat seeped from my scalp and slid down my back before dribbling off.`
`...I struggled to avoid falling into a panic.`
`There was still the possibility that this was really just an accident.`
`...Calm down, Keiichi!!`
`But also don't be so naive, Keiichi!!`
`Being that lax will get you killed next time!!`
`You need to always be on your toes.`
`Don't give them any openings!!`
`If my enemy was really out to kill me, then next time, they would use a more reliable method.`
`If that time came and I was acting like I was now...!!`
`...Getting covered in mud was the price I had paid for my own naiveté.`
`Covered in mud, but without injury.`
` Not even a sprain.`
`I guess this was what you would call the silver lining.`
`I began walking again, this time cautiously.`
`I wouldn't even show a hint of carelessness.`
`I had suspected only Rena and the others up until now.`
`...No, it was because I had suspected them that I had believed there were no other enemies.`
`Ooishi-san had said so, didn't he...?`
`There was the possibility of a village conspiracy...!!`
`Was I really mired so deeply in this situation that I had no choice but to try and carry on as usual?`
`Wouldn't it be safest just to hole myself up in my house...?`
`But... the moment I abandoned my regular routine, everyone around me would abandon theirs as well...`
`That was just too horrifying of a thought.`
`I recalled the tales Ooishi-san told me, of when Hinamizawa was still called Onigafuchi.`
`A frightening tale of an entire village of demons hunting their prey, surrounding them and eating them alive.`
`One must not interfere with the demons.`
`One must pretend not to see it...`
`The enemy were numerous: the whole village.`
` ...The villagers with their unwavering faith in the curse would do nothing to help me.`
`The strong, sudden flash of sunshine made me slightly dizzy.`
`...I had no idea what was going on anymore...`
`When I suspected it was the work of man, I would catch a glimpse of Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
`And when I suspected it was Oyashiro-sama's curse, someone would poke their head out.`
`What was coincidence? What was intentional?`
`...Who was my enemy? Who was just a bystander?`
`No, what I really, truly wanted to know was... how did I end up with the proverbial bullseye painted on my back?`
`Eventually... an answer in a form I could understand will appear...`
`I don't care when that will happen...`
`Because until then... I cannot die...!`
`That alone fueled my resolve to fight and will keep me alive.`
`I remembered seeing the metal bat in the gym storage shed, but there was a padlock on the door barring my entry.`
`At the very least, I wanted to get my hands on it before everyone else arrived at school...`
`I circled around the school grounds impatiently.`
`But all I could find were things like pieces of lumber, nothing that I could bring into the classroom easily.`
`Then... I had an epiphany.`
` I should search inside the classroom.`
`If it was something in the classroom to begin with, then there wouldn't be a problem.`
`I could tell that everyone's indoor shoes were still in their lockers.`
`Good thing I came early. Nobody else was here yet.`
`I wondered... what could I find in the classroom?`
`I didn't think I could find an especially effective weapon like a bat.`
`But it couldn't be helped at this point.`
`Until the gym storage shed was open, I needed to find a substitute.`
`A lingering hint of naiveté whispered that there was no way I'd be attacked at school.`
`But... such soft ideas would no longer protect me.`
`To think that they were slowly making their way into parts of my life that I had once thought impenetrable.`
`...In the worst case... my own house might not be safe anymore...`
`That was an incredibly frightening thought...`
`But I believed that not considering the worst case scenario would have been even more frightening...`
`Anyways, I will survive.`
`...So long as I lived, then I will definitely be able to escape this labyrinth of nonsense...`
` Definitely...`
`My exploration of the classroom came to an impasse.`
`That much was to be expected.`
`There was no way there would be anything that could be a weapon in the classroom.`
`In case of emergency, there was probably nothing I could do but swing my own chair around...`
`My gaze landed on the lockers that had come to be used for personal storage.`
`The locker that Mion used to store her pile of games was among them.`
`There was one for each person in the class, all lined up.`
` Of course, there was one for me as well.`
`Oh yeah, there was supposed to still be a track suit in my locker.`
`...Seeing me covered in mud would be strange.`
` I should go change later...`
`...But first, I needed a weapon.`
`If one of my classmates came, it would be hard to rummage through all the lockers.`
`I swiftly began opening the lockers one by one.`
`They were mostly just filled with things like gym clothes, personal items, and umbrellas.`
`...An umbrella.`
`...If I couldn't find anything better, then this would have to be my weapon.`
`I was about to give up on finding anything decent when I opened a locker that held exactly what I wanted.`
`It was, without a doubt, a metal bat.`
`It was well-worn and pretty beaten up, but there was no doubt it was usable.`
`In that locker that reeked of mold, there also hung a baseball uniform.`
`It was probably the locker of a student in a peewee league or something like that.`
`...If that was the case, then he'd probably ask for it back.`
`At that time I could hear the voices of the children scuffling their way noisily in from the hallway.`
`Amongst them I could make out Rika-chan and Satoko.`
`"...Good morning."`
`"My, my, you're quite early this morning, Keiichi-san."`
`I nonchalantly hid the bat I was holding behind my back.`
`"Wh-What is with your outfit!?`
` You're covered in mud!"`
`"Y-Yeah... I had a little incident.`
` I'm going to change now, so cut me some slack."`
`With that said, I began taking off my clothes. Satoko began to blush just as I expected her to.`
`"Ch-Changing in front of a lady... Have you no tact at all!?"`
`"I would think that a lady staring at someone who was changing would be the one lacking in tact.`
` There's no changing room for the boys, so just deal with it."`
`As Satoko feigned disgust, she went into the hall, still blushing.`
`Conversely, Rika-chan continued to stare at me preparing to change.`
`"...If Rika-chan is a lady as well, then I don't think it would be appropriate for you to be watching."`
`"I'm not a lady, so it's fine."`
`She deliberately pouted and looked at me with upturned eyes.`
`"...Then, starting now, you're a lady."`
`"If I'm a lady, then I suppose I must."`
`Rika-chan, appearing to be satisfied with being considered a lady, made her way to join Satoko in the hallway.`
`Just as I breathed a sigh of relief, Rika-chan stopped suddenly and turned back towards me.`
`"...Are you going to start playing baseball?"`
`It seems that Rika-chan had noticed the bat.`
`"Yeah... just, you know...`
` I was feeling a bit out of shape.`
` So I thought I'd just try practicing my swing..."`
`"I think it's wonderful you're taking care of your health."`
`She was talking like an old lady, despite her appearance.`
`After saying that, Rika-chan started to leave again, but stopped and looked back at me once more.`
`"Please don't lose that bat."`
`It seems she already knew I took it out of someone's locker.`
`There was no name on the locker door.`
`I didn't know whose bat it was, but I would be borrowing it until they complained...`
`It wouldn't be for long; just until the gym storage shed was opened.`
`After quickly changing into the track suit, I checked the time.`
`I still had plenty of time before class began because I came so early.`
`I took the bat in one hand and went out to the school yard. That was, of course, to practice my swing.`
`I needed to make it known I would always have a bat on me so I could practice my swing.`
`At some point, the sunlight had become even stronger.`
`Disregarding my classmates as they made their way to school, I took my position in the shadow of the school building.`
`I wasn't the academic type and I wasn't much of an athlete either.`
`I might get muscle pain if I just suddenly started swinging.`
`I should at least start out with some warm-ups.`
`...I doubt anyone would think I was doing something out of the ordinary...`
` Which was the exact opposite of my actual mental state.`
`I gripped the bat and swung lightly.`
`...The bat was by no means light.`
`The weight would make it a reliable weapon when I needed it to be.`
`Of course, I could only pray that the moment I needed to use this as a weapon would never come.`
`...Just carrying it around could deter attacks against me.`
`At least, that's what I hoped.`
`"Huh!?`
` Kei-chan!?!?`
` What are you doing!?"`
`Being bombarded with such a hysterical voice, I jumped.`
`"Whoa, Keiichi-kun... are you on the baseball team?`
` ...The baseball team??"`
`It was Rena and Mion.`
`"I was surprised to hear you went off ahead... what are you doing, Kei-chan?"`
`"Can't you tell by looking?`
` I'm practicing my swing... For the championship.`
` You can say it's part of my diet if you want."`
`"...Diet? Kei-chan, are you really that fat?"`
`"Bet you didn't know. I actually have a beer belly.`
` It's plump and jiggles."`
`"...P-Plump and jiggles..."`
`"...Rena, you don't have to imagine something weird like that."`
`To disrupt Rena from imagining something that vulgar, I ruffled her hair messily.`
`"Well then, hope you make it to regionals, at least.`
` This old man will cheer you on."`
`"...Regionally speaking, it seems that Oshima High is pretty strong.`
` They say their southpaw, Kameda-kun, is amazing.`
` Good luck!"`
`Seems they've already taken me for a baseball nut, but oh well...`
`Well, if I really did make it to the championship, it would be a cinch.`
`After all, I'd be the pitcher and catcher.`
`I'd pitch the ball, then run past that ball I just threw and change over to being the catcher in a burst of super incredible explosive speed.`
`I laughed dryly at the ludicrous image...`
`Coming back to my senses, I smashed the bat against the ground.`
`"...Damn it!!!`
` What am I laughing at!?"`
`I pounded the ground over and over.`
` With each impact, the reverberation traveling through the bat stung my hands.`
`If they smile at me like that... I'll... I'll... ngh!!`
`Don't allow anyone close to me. Don't trust anyone.  No matter how many times I tell myself that... If they made me smile like that... I'll... ngh!!!`
`I already knew quite well that there were demons dwelling in my smiling friends!`
`...But... I just couldn't believe it.`
`Did that kind of split personality really exist...?`
`Like how Rena confessed to the doctor... were they simply being possessed by Oyashiro-sama...?`
`In other words... did a supernatural being like Oyashiro-sama really exist, and was it possessing everyone to try and kill me...?`
`Yeah... That would be wonderful...`
`If only everyone were actually my friends all along and everything was all just Oyashiro-sama's fault...`
`"You damned fool, Keiichi Maebara!!!!! Come on, now!"`
`I yelled out, drawing out all the power from the pit of my stomach, and raised the bat violently into the air.`
`"...Stop being so sooooooft!!!!"`
`As I screamed out with all my might, I beat the metal bat into the ground over and over.`
`With every impact, my weakness was being beaten down...`
`Smash.`
` Forget.`
` Smash.`
` Don't be soft.`
` Smash.`
` Know your enemy.`
` Smash.`
` Like hell I'd let them kill me.`
`My shoulders heaving up and down from my ragged breathing, I heard the first bell ring just as I calmed down.`
`I gasped with a sudden realization.`
` ...That was the final bell.`
`As I felt all the tension drain from me, I let out a deep breath.`
`My mind was in a muddled state for much of the entire day. I didn't feel like I was awake, but it didn't feel like I was asleep either.`
`I couldn't say it felt especially comfortable, but I felt a kind of relief that the sanctity of the school part of my daily life had yet to be violated.`
`How long would I have to keep on living like this...?`
`I could only grit my teeth and bear with it as this living hell slowly gnawed away at me.`
`"Keiichi-kun!`
` Come on!`
` It's club time, club time!"`
`The sound of Rena's voice brought me back to my senses.`
`"Come on come on Kei-chan, stop spacing out!`
` Bring your desk, your desk!"`
`Everyone was moving their desks together as usual.`
`That's right, it was happy fun club time.`
`But I had no intention of taking part.`
`I haphazardly stuffed the contents of my desk into my bag as I prepared to go home.`
`It was a weak-handed gesture to avoid having to actually say, "I'll be going home now."`
`"...What's this, Kei-chan?`
` You planning on going home right away again...?"`
`Mion sounded quite disappointed.`
`"...I'm just not in the mood. Could you just let me be for a while?"`
`The tone of the words that spilled from my mouth matched Mion's disapproving glare.`
`It felt like the air in the room had dried out.`
`Satoko looked like she was about to say something, but perhaps dissuaded by the mood, she swallowed her words and stayed silent.`
`Nobody said a thing...`
` I took that to mean that I could leave if I wanted...`
`But the collective gaze of the four of them, like the tiny pins used to mount an insect in a display, held me in place.`
`Rena was the one who cut through the heavy mood.`
`"...Keiichi-kun... you just didn't like... playing with girls, I guess... I guess..."`
`She said it in such a melancholic tone that it sent a wave of pain racing through my heart.`
`If this pain was going to kill me, I wanted it to be the soft part of me that could still feel pain.`
`I tore at my chest, violently tearing out the pins that held me in place.`
`"That's not it at all...!"`
`I'd only be hurting myself by saying anything more, so I swallowed my words.`
`Cutting things off there, I turned away and exited the classroom.`
`They didn't speak a word to me as I left.`
`It was a long, dull trip back home, but I didn't lose focus.`
`I firmly squeezed the grip of the bat which was already soggy from sweat.`
`Realizing that, I wiped it down with my sleeve. If something were to happen, I wouldn't want it to be slippery.`
`Since this morning, I'd become especially sensitive to the presence of cars.`
`Even while walking, my ears pricked up, and sought out threatening sounds and presences that could be closing in...`
`And that was why I could hear it.`
`Without a doubt, there were footsteps.`
`Those footsteps had matched up perfectly with mine for a while now.`
`From what I could sense... It was just one person...`
` But I had no intention of being careless.`
`Did they intend to follow me like that car this morning, until we were in a good location to assault me...?`
`Then it wasn't a good idea to keep walking like this.`
`I stopped walking and looked back.`
`The wooded path crowded with trees responded with silence as if there was nobody there to begin with.`
`But I wouldn't be fooled. I was certain footsteps were following me.`
`And just as I stopped, the footsteps stopped, as well.`
`...Meaning, the person following me wanted to keep their distance.`
`That was, without question, proof that I was their target.`
`I held my breath, waiting for that presence to panic and start moving again...`
`The trees rustled with the sound of the wind.`
`The higurashi also joined in the dissonant chorus, trying to throw my focus into disarray.`
`Had five minutes passed?`
` Or had I been like this for a whole thirty minutes...?`
`...It was so hard to breathe that I might have suffocated; it seemed I would be the first one to panic.`
`Without a doubt, he was lurking in the shade of that tree with bated breath.`
`Then... I'd make the first move...!`
`I fixed my grip on the bat.`
` ...I raised it up to my shoulder to be ready to swing it at any time.`
`"...Hey!!!`
` I know you're there!!"`
`With all of my might, I screamed at whoever was hiding in the shade of the trees.`
`But... the presence in the shade didn't budge.`
`Until the moment I found them, they had no intention of revealing themselves...`
`"I know already!!!`
` I know you're there!!!!"`
`I screamed out angrily at them again, but even still, they didn't move at all.`
`Then I'll go over there myself!!`
`With all due vigilance, I approached, step by step...`
`Stepping into the tree's shadow... I saw a human figure there.`
`That figure... was curled up like a small animal.`
`"Rena...!"`
`When she realized I had found her, her expression softened.`
`She seemed apologetic, but wasn't going to speak a word.`
`"...Did you have some business with me...!?"`
`I wouldn't accept that silence and screamed the question at her.`
`"N-Not really... it's just... um..."`
`Rena was in a panic with tears welling up in her eyes.`
` But it was obvious that she had been following me.`
`"What about the club?"`
`"...S... Since you're not... I'm not..."`
`"That shouldn't matter!`
` Don't mind me and just play!"`
`"...B... But... I'm just worried... about you..."`
`Thinking about how I'd been acting up until now, it wasn't hard to imagine that my behavior could have been perceived as strange.`
`So Rena was concerned... at a quick glance, that's how it would seem.`
`But I wasn't going to let my guard down that easily.`
`Even if that was really the case, she still wouldn't have to do something like try to tail me.`
`...She should have called out to me when I was leaving and gone out right with me.`
`But Rena didn't do that.`
`She kept her distance from me and matched my walking speed.`
` On top of that, she matched the sound of her footsteps and deviously tried to hide her presence from me.`
`Then, after she realized I noticed she was there, she held her breath as she tried hiding from me.`
`She wore a timid expression that would force one to take pity on her, but without a doubt... she was tailing me.`
`"Stop following me."`
`"Ha... hau..."`
`Still glaring at Rena, I continued walking onwards.`
`After I'd walked for a bit, she ignored my command and began walking again... so I yelled at her once more.`
`"I told you not to follow me!!!"`
`"Eek!! ...B-But... My house is in the same direction...!"`
`"Then walk ahead of me! I'll start walking once I can't see you anymore."`
`I moved out of the way and waved my bat violently to urge her forward.`
`"I-I'd like... to go home together... with you..."`
`Making a pitiful expression, she meekly squeaked out the words in a voice that she knew would cut into my heart.`
`...That agitated me to no end.`
`I knew it was a lie.`
`If you wanted to go home together, then you should have called out to me.`
`Now you're just blurting out random lies!!!`
`"I-I'm s-s-s-s-s-sorry, I'm sorry...!!!"`
`It seemed that the seething anger within me was written all over my face.`
`...Even without me saying anything, Rena had understood what I was feeling inside.`
`"If you get it, then go!!"`
`I swung the bat, urging her again to walk.`
`Rena looked back and forth between me and the bat and started walking hesitantly, then stopped again.`
`"...Go on, then. Hurry!!"`
`"I-I'm going!`
` So please stop with the bat...!!`
` I-It's scary...!!!"`
`Rena guarded herself while pointing at me holding the bat.`
`She may have realized that I wasn't planning on using this bat for baseball...`
`I lowered the bat, but still guardedly opened the way for her.`
`"Go...`
` There's no problem now, is there?"`
`"..."`
`There was nothing else she could protest.`
`...She passed by me timidly so as to not set me off.`
`As I watched her pass by, she stopped completely after having barely moved at all.`
`"Hey, don't stop...!"`
`Then, a powerful gust blew past us, barraging my face with dust.`
`The dust got into my eyes and clouded my vision...!`
`While rubbing my eyes with my left hand, I swung blindly with the bat in my right, protecting the small opening I had presented.`
`But Rena didn't even try to attack during that opening.`
`Attack me? No... She hadn't budged an inch.`
`I could tell from the sound of her fluttering skirt in the wind.`
`As her skirt settled, so did the silence.`
`At that moment, the voice inside of me immediately warned me of impending danger.`
`...I was caught by surprise.`
`...The smell of the air... had changed...?`
`Without me realizing it, the air around me suddenly felt like a calamity was about to befall me.`
`It was like the air had suddenly become invisible concrete. Like Rena and I were locked in this space.`
`Rena didn't move an inch...`
` Also unable to move, I stared at her back.`
`Rena was the first to break the silence.`
`Instantly, she altered her stance.`
`...I felt like I had just witnessed her shift from Rena into that other person who looks like Rena.`
`But... The voice was one I knew well, which filled me with a kind of bewildering pity.`
`Carelessly, I felt relief upon hearing that pitiful voice...`
`"...Uh...`
` Um...`
` Well, excuse me, but...!`
` ...Um, can I ask you something?"`
`Too shy to even turn around, Rena squeezed her voice out desperately...`
` as she trembled.`
`"...What?"`
`"Uh...`
` Umm, well...`
` well...`
` Wh-Why do you have a bat, I wonder...`
` I wonder...?"`
`...The question Rena asked was by no means unexpected.`
`"I can carry whatever I want."`
`"But, but... you didn't have one up until today...!`
` ...Wh-Why so suddenly...!?"`
`"It's alright if I decide to do something suddenly, isn't it?`
` ...Is it strange that I have a bat?"`
`"B-Because, Keiichi... You're not the kind of person to play baseball!`
` It's weird...!"`
`I couldn't tell what kind of answer she was looking for and I was getting tired of answering her.`
`"...I just suddenly got the urge to play baseball.`
` Is that so weird?"`
`"It's weird...!"`
`She answered instantly and that annoyed me slightly.`
`"I just suddenly wanted to play baseball.`
` And I wanted to practice my swing, so I'm carrying around a bat.`
` What's strange about that?"`
`"Strange.`
` Weird.`
` Definitely.`
` Why you too..."`
`"Your ramblings are annoying me...`
` Is it that strange for me to have an interest in sports!?"`
`I tried to sound a bit more threatening to end the conversation.`
`Until my suspicions about Rena were cleared, I had no obligation to answer her questions.`
`"...I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry...!`
` Don't get so angry...!!"`
`Rena still didn't turn around and spat out words of apology one after the next.`
`"J-Just one last thing!!`
` Tell me one last thing...!!"`
`"...I don't feel like talking anymore.`
` Hurry up and go!!"`
`I yelled loudly at her, causing her to flinch like she had been struck.`
`...Seeing her in such a pathetic state caused my heart to ache sorely...`
`But even though she was afraid, she stubbornly kept herself from moving.`
`Before I was able to threaten her again, Rena asked her final question.`
`"Wh-Why is even your bat the same!?!?"`
`What did she mean by the bat was the same?`
` I had no idea what she was talking about.`
`"...What are you saying...?"`
`"I mean... Why is even the bat the same!?"`
`"I don't understand what you mean at all!`
` Say it clearly!!!"`
`Even still, Rena didn't turn around.`
` After inhaling deeply, she screamed.`
`"I mean... Why is even the bat the same as Satoshi-kun's!?!?"`
`"Satoshi... being...`
` Huh...?`
`???"`
`Upon hearing that name out of the blue, I became dumbfounded for a brief moment.`
`By "Satoshi"... did she mean the student who transferred out last year?`
` ...No, that couldn't be.`
`Rena had tried to cover it up by saying he transferred, but Ooishi-san told me quite clearly that he was missing.`
`He was the student who sat at my seat up until last year. He was believed to have been demoned away by Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`I didn't know the details about his disappearance.`
`The aunt he lived with was killed the night of the Watanagashi by a drug addict, and not long after that, he suddenly vanished, and was now missing...`
`That Satoshi and I were... what?`
`My gaze fell to the bat in my hands.`
`...Could it be...?`
`"Satoshi Houjou"`
`It was a bit difficult to see, but that was what was written on the white tape at the end of the bat.`
`...I see... so this was Satoshi's bat...`
`"...O... Oh.`
` This... was Satoshi's bat.`
` ...Since nobody was using it, I borrowed it.`
` That's not a problem, is it!?"`
`"Th... That's not it!!!"`
`The way Rena said that... made it seem like this bat was something that should never be touched.`
`Like it was some sort of offering at a shrine... or a memento of the deceased...`
`I could only stand there, perplexed and unable to respond. Rena continued speaking without waiting for a reply.`
`"...Why is it...`
` Why is it...`
` that you're doing the exact same thing Satoshi-kun did when it happened to him!?"`
`Rena was talking about more than just the bat belonging to Satoshi.`
`"...It was the same with Satoshi-kun!!`
`He joined a baseball team... but he didn't really like baseball...!"`
`"What does that have to do with me...?"`
`"Satoshi-kun also... suddenly started walking around with a bat one day!!!!`
` He joined a team... but he wasn't the type to play sports...!!"`
`What about it...!?`
` I closed my mouth before I could say that out loud.`
`...Listen carefully, Keiichi!`
`Rena is trying to tell us something important...`
`"Satoshi-kun also... one day came to school all by himself all of a sudden.`
` Just like Keiichi-kun!!!`
`Then one day, he suddenly started practicing his swing.`
` Just like Keiichi-kun!!!`
`Then one day, he suddenly began carrying the bat around with him.`
` Just like Keiichi-kun!!!`
`Then one day, he suddenly...`
` Gh..."`
`...Then one day he suddenly... what!?`
`Rena had swallowed her words.`
`Rena's sudden silence brought a hush back to the surrounding area.`
`...It was then that I could finally digest the content of the entire conversation.`
`She was saying my chain of actions... was exactly the same as Satoshi's.`
`What was... the meaning of this!?`
`Up until just now, I'd forgotten all about Satoshi.`
`I had never paid much thought to him in the first place.`
`Not only that, I didn't even know anything of what he'd done.`
`My actions today should have been my own creation, after all the planning I had done.`
`But...they... had been the exact same as Satoshi's...?`
`Then Satoshi... no, more importantly...!!`
`If both Satoshi and I acted the same, then there was a really good possibility that what happened after would be the same...`
`"Rena... that day... what happened to Satoshi!?"`
`Rena knew...`
` She knew what became of Satoshi.`
` No, forget about what happened to a guy in the past!`
`Rena... knew what was going to happen... to me!!!`
`"A-Answer me, Rena!!`
` Satoshi... What happened to him!?"`
`With that, I grabbed Rena's shoulder violently and forcibly turned her around to face me.`
`As I faced her, I felt a jolt travel through my entire body...!!`
`"I told you...`
` Keiichi-kun."`
`It was that person that I didn't know.`
`At least, it definitely wasn't the Rena Ryuugu I'd been talking to up until now.`
`The voice just now didn't have a trace of the trembling or emotion that it had had before.`
`...The amount of regret I felt for turning her around so carelessly was unsurpassed...!`
`That gaze that pierced like a cold needle... The smile on her face that invoked an image of having been carved out by a knife...`
`Chills went down my spine... My mind froze under a layer of rime.`
`Both of Rena's eyes pierced through mine, leaving me unable to look away.`
`...As if to remind me of the fear from that time before... Rena brought her face close to mine, so close that I could feel her breath.`
`...Her face had filled my entire field of vision.`
`...Then... her sharply-shaped lips grew even sharper. Like the curve of a crescent moon...`
` she grinned.`
`"I told you.`
` Keiichi-kun."`
`After a short pause, Rena repeated the same words again.`
`"Satoshi-kun, you see...`
` transferred out."`
`Transferred... meaning what...?`
`...What Rena meant must have been some new definition of 'transfer' that I was previously not aware of...`
`My throat and lips dried up, I couldn't even acknowledge what I had just heard.`
`All... I could do was swallow down my own saliva...`
`...It would seem that Rena saw that as a nod.`
`She pulled her gaze back and spryly stepped back two, three paces.`
`As she did, my legs gave out and I fell to my knees pathetically.`
`...Rena, and me on my knees underneath her emotionless smile...`
`That had to be a very odd sight indeed...`
`Seeing me in that pathetic state, she neither scoffed at me nor held out her hand.`
`But I could neither stand nor escape with her gaze shooting through my eyes.`
`There was undoubtedly a metal bat in my hand.`
`But right now, it was useless to me. I was like a fly caught in her web.`
`Heavy sweat beaded all over my body, I could feel it dripping from my skin...`
`"...But you won't, will you,`
` Keiichi-kun...?"`
`...Rena finally released me from that cage of time after what felt like an eternity.`
`But her question was missing something important and was incredibly vague.`
`Once again I swallowed hard, urging her on.`
`"...D... Do what...?"`
`What did she not want me to do...?`
`"Transfer."`
