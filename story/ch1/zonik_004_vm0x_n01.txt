` It's...!!`
`"They say he has a collection of dakimakura love pillows."`
`HaouUuh!?`
`"Is it true that he sleeps with them at night?"`
`Who were they talking about!?`
`"I heard he can't get enough of the fluffy soft sensation!"`
`No way I would do thaaat!!`
`"I heard he even has one with a photo of our Class Rep stuck to it~!"`
`"Did you hear?`
` I heard that the new transfer student Maebara-san is into anime girls!`
` Kyahahahaha!!"`
`"Yeah! It's not even in the same league as jumbo jets!`
` What fell on Rena's house...`
`was a comet!!"`
`"A-An asteroid!?"`
`"Yeah, the aliens deactivated the Roche limit with a device they created and started by hurling one asteroid.`
` Even I didn't think that they'd go this far.`
` And they plan to drop 100 of them next!! `
`The Earth Federation was totally unprepared!!"`
`The lower grades were dumbfounded, their eyes like saucers at the grand turn of events...`
`"A... An Earth Federation...?`
` Are we really at war with aliens?"`
`"If things go on like this, Earth is finished!!`
` But don't despair!! If we have Rena's ultrasonic "Mach-Rena-Punch," it'll be possible to intercept all of the asteroids! `
`That's right, the Earth Federation's top ace... is Rena Ryuugu!!"`
`"A-Amazing...!"`
`"So the older kids really ARE different!"`
`"But... Rena-san might be strong... but, can she really push back the moon..?"`
`"Unnecessary concerns!`
` Just days ago, Rena blew away a comet bomb that was going to smash into Earth.`
` One or two hundred asteroids are nothing before one of her light-speed punches!"`
`"What are you all saying!?`
` I can't destroy asteroids by punching them!"`
`I had agreed to meet with Rena to dig Colonel Randy out of that mountain of treasure from before.`
`If they come to dump again illegally, he'll be buried completely and it'll be impossible to dig him out, `
`and if that happens... Rena will undoubtedly go after the Colonel Randy in front of the fried chicken place in town.`
`"Wh-What was that all about!?`
` She was walking around with a bared hatchet!`
` And she was laughing with a huge smile across her face!!"`
`Well, it certainly would be quite the spectacle for a girl of her age to be roaming around with a hatchet.`
`Somebody gallivanting about while waving a hatchet around certainly would seem dangerous.`
`"You should put a cover on that hatchet when you have it in public.`
` It's not good to carry it around out in the open like that!"`
`She's probably the only person who could carry a hatchet around Hinamizawa and not be considered suspicious...`
`I took the hatchet from Rena and made my way up the unstable slope.`
`"Just wait, Colonel Randy.`
` Keiichi-kun will save you...â˜†"`
`First of all, I'd never used a hatchet before.`
`"I'm fine!`
` I'm almost there.`
` I'll make sure Rena can give Colonel Randy a good-night kiss tonight."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...Thanks.`
` ...Giving Colonel Randy... a good night kiss... hau..."`
`With a bit of a wry smile on my face, I grabbed the handle of the hatchet and headed back to worksite.`
`I had swung the hatchet countless times today, just like this.`
` Contact.`
` Shards of wood splintered.`
`The weight I put behind the hatchet not only split through the beam, but smashed the statue's shoulder as well.`
`You're pretty lucky, Colonel Randy. Your new master is a pretty decent person.`
`"...Waa... Colonel Randy... He really is kyute!"`
`And so Jack and Jill went down the hill, carrying a human-sized bag and an unsheathed hatchet!`
`"I do know...!!`
` I do know!!`
` I do know!!!...`
` ...`
`I- it's..."`
`"...It was quite a disturbing incident... They still haven't found it, have they?"`
`In the dark, the doll just lying there felt a little too real, sort of like a bad omen... I came back to my senses and laughed dryly at how pathetic I was being.`
