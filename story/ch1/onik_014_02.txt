`Satoshi and I... had what?`
`All my well-planned actions throughout the day turned out to have been nothing more than a reenactment of what Satoshi had done.`
`Satoshi... had he really been in the same situation as I was now...?`
`The friends he had gotten along with had changed suddenly... and for no reason (at least none that I had noticed), planned to kill him...?`
`Then, fearing for his life as I am, he got a bat to protect himself, and carried it around every day to practice his swing?`
`And then one day, suddenly...`
`"He transferred."`
`My blood went cold, causing a prickling sensation to course through my veins.`
`Starting near my heart, it radiated outwards, from the top of my head to the soles of my feet... chilling every part of me without recourse.`
`What did she mean by transfer?`
` What did she mean by transfer?`
` Was Satoshi still at wherever he transferred to?`
`Was he the only one who would be able to understand me?`
`Would he be able to tell me why it all ended up like this?`
`More importantly, where did he transfer to!?`
`What did she mean by transfer?`
` What did she mean by transfer...?`
`Before I knew it, I was at my front door.`
`The frigid knob was hard to turn.`
` ...Was nobody home?`
`It wasn't that odd of an occurrence. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the single key attached to my fur seal keychain.`
`I stepped into the entryway. Just as I was about to take off my shoes, a chill ran down my spine.`
`...Someone had entered right behind me.`
`Like a classmate messing around... standing right up against my back...`
`You're kidding, right...?`
` It had to be my imagination...`
`Logically speaking, it was impossible for someone to be able to hide their presence within my personal space all the way through the door.`
`But there was undoubtedly someone behind me.`
`...Hey now, hey now, Keiichi.`
`...How do you know they're 'there' even though they're behind you...!?`
`...Because... I could hear the sound of flowing hair.`
`There's no other reason... I'd hear that sound.`
` That was the presence.`
`...Because... I could hear the sound of them blinking.`
`Keiichi Maebara, there's no way you could hear that!`
`My most base instincts were warning me of the presence. Common sense was telling me that it was just my imagination.`
`It was just my imagination, there was nobody behind me. I began to erase the mental image of an eerie figure standing behind me.`
`But at the same time, I asked myself... if there was 'nobody,' then what was I feeling...? As an uncomfortable sensation crawled up my spine.`
`Actually... wouldn't it be better if there was somebody there...?`
`If... there was nobody there when you turned around... would you be able to accept that...?`
`I'd be able to answer all those questions just by looking behind me.`
`...But... I didn't have enough courage... to even do that simple task...`
`Oh, right... I could try speaking to them...`
` The person behind me... might answer me.`
`It was a random thought... I didn't care how I went about it, just so long as I didn't have to turn around.`
`...If I had calmed down and thought about it... I would have known that that wouldn't have solved anything.`
`"Wh... Who is it...?"`
`I spoke in such a hoarse, broken voice that I couldn't believe it was my own.`
`I could almost feel them contemplating their response.`
`...I felt it. There's no way I should be able to do that!`
`Calm down, Keiichi. It's all in your head...!`
`That time, I was certain I heard it.`
`As if hesitantly trying to answer my inquiry... I was certain I could hear the sound of somebody inhaling.`
`I heard it.`
`I heard it.`
`I heard it clearly.`
`It was a girl.`
`A young girl.`
`I didn't know who, but...`
`A tiny speck of courage in me —however reckless it was— inspired a primal yet fitting solution to this current predicament: a scream.`
`All the force in my body released from my lungs and through my throat, ceasing all thought processes in my head.`
`Suppressing all my thoughts and emotions, I began to collapse like a house of cards, somehow managing to twist my body and look back as I did so.`
`It was definitely there.`
`Right there.`
`Somebody was there.`
`Until the moment I turned around, until I brought the area behind me into my field of vision, they were definitely there.`
`Falling face-up, my eyes traced the remnants of the presence suspended in the empty space...`
`...It couldn't be... They were invisible... They looked like they weren't there... But were they actually still standing there...???`
`As I screamed, all the emotions I was holding back burst free in a violent wave.`
`However, I was decidedly calm as my emotional dam collapsed.`
`...The turbulent wave of pent-up emotions was skillfully diverted... into a torrent of aggression.`
`That emotion was definitely required to extricate myself from the bizarre situation happening right in front of me.`
`In my state of heightened lucidity, I entrusted my body to the fury...`
`The metal bat held firm in my right hand as if drawn there by a magnet.`
`A mid-level sweep would be the hardest attack to dodge... I remembered reading something like that from a book about swordsmanship or something.`
`"RAaaAAaAAaAh!!!!!"`
`I brandished my will to fight.`
`The afterimage of that amalgamation of metal flashed as it swung from left to right, beating against the entryway!!!!`
`The bat slammed into the right wall, the tip rebounding violently.`
`...Very calmly, I transferred the force of the rebound into a sweep to the left.`
`The door of the shoe cupboard was split into pieces.`
`Those two swings whiffed through empty space, but they seemed to have a great psychological impact on the enemy.`
`...I could feel the panic emanating from that space.`
`The attack wasn't the only thing required.`
`...I extracted the bat from the cupboard it was embedded in and screamed as I spun my entire body around in a large arc.`
`"WRAaAAAAaAAaAAAhhh!!!"`
`My screams shook the air, imbuing my ferocious swing with even more destructive power...!!!`
`Crrraaaaak!!!!`
`Without mercy or restraint, my violent strike—with certainly fatal force behind it—shattered the top of the cupboard.`
`None of my attacks struck the enemy, but my ferocity had certainly seemed to impact them.`
`Breathing heavily, my entire body soaked in sweat, the invisible enemy—there, but not there—dispersed.`
`When I was certain that the enemy had retreated, I locked the front door and latched the chain.`
`No way, had it only feigned retreat and was now inside my house!?!?`
`Once again, I channeled my aggression and searched the house for the presence...`
` but it was gone.`
`I had succeeded in fending it off.`
`...At that moment, the tension drained from my body and I let out a deep sigh of relief...`
`All of the emotions I'd been holding back chaotically merged together and began to flood out. A hodgepodge of fear, accomplishment, and disbelief all mixed together and began to flow through my body.`
`Unable to deal with each individual feeling, I beat them all back with the strongest: exhaustion.`
`Even in this moment... I remained composed.`
`After checking that all the doors throughout the house were locked, I went up to my room on the second floor and closed the curtains.`
`I straightened my back and tilted my head back a little... After clearing my mind of all my idle thoughts, I managed to calm down even more...`
`What was that at the front door...?`
`There was definitely something there.`
`Thinking about it, maybe it was just an apparition I dreamt up in my confused state... but I really didn't think that was the case.`
`Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...`
` Compose yourself...`
`But no matter how calmly I thought about it... what just happened wasn't a figment of my imagination.`
`It was obviously a supernatural phenomenon. And without a doubt, something was behind me.`
`It wasn't some sort of illusion I saw amidst my confusion and disorientation!`
`Proof?`
` I had just one piece.`
`...When I asked "Who is it?" they inhaled as if they were about to answer.`
` That 'sound' had clearly reached my ears.`
`The situation I was in right now was still unclear.`
`Either I'd been possessed by the supernatural phenomenon known as Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
`Or this was a ruse by the villagers who believed in it and were imitating it.`
`Either way, their motives were unclear.`
`The roundabout way it had been done was also still a mystery.`
`If it was perpetrated by humans, that would mean admitting that it was Rena and the rest of them doing it, but it would be solvable.`
`Ooishi-san and the rest of the police would surely arrest my enemy.`
`But... If it was a manifestation of Oyashiro-sama's curse... I wondered what would happen...?`
`Ooishi-san very clearly declared that curses didn't exist.`
`At that time, those words were pretty dependable... but as things were now, with the rising possibility that the perpetrators were not human... He suddenly seemed quite unreliable.`
`If I told Ooishi-san this was the work of Oyashiro-sama's curse... what would happen?`
`...I couldn't imagine his reaction, but it would go without question that a void would expand rapidly between myself and Ooishi-san.`
`With me having so few allies to begin with and not being able to confidently declare whether or not this was a curse, there was no merit to doing that.`
`I'd better keep the 'facts' of what just happened at the doorway to myself.`
`...It would be better if I didn't add what happened here to the memo behind the clock.`
`There was still the ever so slight possibility...`
` that I was actually confused when I thought I was composed, and I was just going berserk in the entryway.`
`How wonderful would that be if that was really what happened?`
`I would be able to refute Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`But if I denied Oyashiro-sama's curse, then that would mean admitting that Rena and the rest were the perpetrators.`
`If I said that Rena and the rest weren't the perpetrators, then that would mean believing in Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`By denying both of those... I would be admitting that I myself was losing it.`
`The three options from which I couldn't choose became a trilemma of sorts. They mixed together and formed a whirlpool in my mind, making my head spin...`
`Once again, I straightened myself and leaned my head back slightly to cool myself down.`
`...Calm down, Keiichi.`
`...Accept what has actually happened as reality.`
`...Stop thinking of anything more than that...`
`But... I couldn't help but think of it.`
`...How wonderful it would be... if it turned out I was delirious and everything up until now was a figment of my imagination.`
`Oyashiro-sama's curse wouldn't exist and I would still be bestest buddies with Rena and the rest...`
`I would have to be crazy.`
`That was the first time in my life I'd ever wished for such a thing.`
`The phone rang noisily downstairs.`
`Generally there were no calls for me, so I never really answered the phone much.`
`But since my parents weren't here, I had no choice.`
`I squirmed off the bed and went downstairs.`
`"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."`
`"Keiichi? This is Mom."`
`...I intuitively had a bad feeling about this.`
` It was because I thought she was going to ask me to go out and buy some things.`
`So I took the initiative.`
`"What?`
` I don't mind having instant noodles for dinner.`
` There's still a lot of them."`
`The other day, we went out as a family and bought a whole case of cup noodles.`
`I wanted to get a bunch of different kinds, actually, but they refused since the individual packs were expensive. So instead, I got a whole case of the Mega-size Pork-bone & Ginger flavored ones I liked.`
`But my parents don't like strong flavors and didn't touch any of them. So the cupboards were still full of them.`
`"So you see, there really isn't a need to go shopping, right?"`
`"Keiichi, I'm not asking you to go shopping.`
` Both Mommy and Daddy have to go to Tokyo right now because of work."`
`"Huh...!?`
` Right now!?"`
`This was really... abrupt.`
`"No, we're already here.`
` We left this afternoon."`
`It's quite a distance to Tokyo from Hinamizawa.`
` Gunning it full speed down the highway, would still take six hours.`
`...Dad has a license, but since he doesn't like the highway they likely took the train...`
` It would have taken longer.`
`"I'm thinking you might understand since you heard us speaking last night, but it has to do with Daddy's contract. Right now, things aren't going so smoothly."`
`Now that she mentioned it, I did remember that they talked all that time about how his job prospects weren't looking so good.`
`"Daddy is really sensitive about things like this, so if we leave things as they are, it will affect his work."`
`Part of my father's particular fragile artistic personality: his emotions changed as easily as the fall sky.`
` ...You could also just say he couldn't take criticism.`
`"But... something like that can be done over the phone!"`
`"Keiichi... This is your father's job, so can you support him a bit, please?`
` Anyway, it's just faster to talk about it in person,`
` so there wouldn't be any misunderstandings."`
`As their son, there was nothing more I could say once they started talking about work.`
`"So, we'll be back tomorrow night.`
` Keiichi, will you be fine on your own?"`
`"It's not like I'll die or anything."`
`"...Keiichi, you shouldn't speak so lightly of dying...`
` If there's something troubling you, just talk to us.`
` I believe Mommy will be able to help out."`
`Yesterday I did bring up "If I died" rather abruptly, so I supposed they were a little worried.`
`...But really, I was more depressed by the fact that nothing would be solved by telling them.`
`But I didn't plan on dying...`
`...At least not while I still knew nothing... I would never allow it.`
`"I won't die.`
` I won't...`
` I'll survive even if I have to gnaw my leg off."`
`"Yeah...`
` See you then.`
` Tomorrow morning, make sure to wake up.`
` And eat your breakfast.`
`And don't forget to take a bath and brush your teeth."`
`"Yeah, yeah... see you."`
`The call ended like that.`
`...Sometimes my parents went off to Tokyo for business meetings.`
` But Tokyo was far away.`
`They normally did things by phone...`
`The times they did go were normally planned out in advance, it never happened this suddenly.`
`I couldn't say that those circumstances didn't feel strange, or rather... unnatural.`
`Anyway... I only needed to recognize the reality of the situation...`
`...That tonight... I was the only one in the house.`
` That when my parents came back from work, I'd be gone... missing.`
`Vanished.`
`...Looking back on the series of events of the previous five years involving Oyashiro-sama's curse, it wouldn't seem that strange at all.`
`Come to think of it... it was getting pretty late.`
`I didn't think it was good that the only light on in the whole house was from my room on the second floor.`
`It was the same as broadcasting to the enemy that my parents were gone and this was their chance.`
`First I ran to the living room, flicked on the lights, and turned the TV on to a reassuring volume.`
`Next was the study. I similarly turned on the lights and some music.`
`With this, from the outside it would look like my parents were here.`
`Once again, I went through the house, checking to see if there was anything left unlocked...`
`...When I saw the veranda and the laundry still hanging out there, I went pale.`
`That would have made it too obvious! I needed to take it down...!!`
`I snatched down the laundry haphazardly and erased all traces that my mother wasn't there.`
` It should be fine now...`
` ...Ah!`
` The garage!!`
`They hadn't gone all the way to Tokyo by car, but they had gone up to Okinomiya station.`
`The garage was empty, wide open, and in plain sight... this was not good!!`
`I panicked and rushed out the back to close the normally-open garage door.`
` It should be fine now...`
` Ah, I needed to get the paper!! `
`Mom always got the paper. Since they left in the afternoon... The evening paper was still out there!!`
`My premonition was correct.`
` I pulled out everything from the mailbox and dropped it in the entryway.`
`...With this... for sure this time... it should be fine...`
`Come to think of it... Leaving the cupboard busted like that from my little freak-out was kind of bad.`
`I'll just say I tripped and fell, and the bat I was holding smashed into it...`
`Even so, just leaving it in its current state wasn't good.`
` I should clean it up a little before Mom got back and scolded me.`
`I remembered that there was a broom and dust pan in the closet. As I was going to get them, the phone rang once again.`
`"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."`
`"Oh, is this Keiichi-kun?`
` Is your mother around?"`
`"A-Ah, she isn't here at the moment..."`
`You idiot, Keiichi Maebara!!`
` Don't reveal that your parents are gone...!!`
` You can follow up still... Calm down and take care of it...!`
`"I-I think she'll be back soon...!!"`
`That wasn't a good response either...!`
`Now they might say they'll call again, or to tell her to call them when she comes back!!`
`"Then that's fine.`
` It wasn't anything important...`
` Well then, sorry for the bother."`
`The scenario I feared didn't play out, eliciting a sigh of relief.`
`That call was fortunate in more ways than one.`
`...I'd have to deal with any telephone calls coming in for my parents tonight.`
`I was somehow able to deal with the phone call just now... But I couldn't continue to rely on such poor improvisation.`
`I needed to make up a good story to explain that my parents were home but couldn't answer the phone at the moment.`
`They were making tempura and couldn't step away right now...`
` That wasn't good enough.`
`They were sick and went to bed because they weren't feeling well.`
` ...Was that going to be safe enough?`
`I was thinking about it on the way back to my room when the phone rang once again.`
`It was like they were calling because they knew I was going to lie.`
`I didn't want to pick up...`
` but I knew I had to.`
` They'd suspect my parents weren't here.`
`...I should have just taken the phone off the hook under the pretense that I didn't realize that it was...`
`But since the phone rang, I had to pick it up.`
`I prepared myself and lifted up the receiver...`
`"Hello..."`
`I stopped announcing this was the Maebara residence. I had no reason to be kind to someone I didn't know the identity of...`
`But unlike my uncouth voice, the person on the other side sounded goofy and lighthearted.`
`"Hello, my apologies for calling so late.`
` This is Ooishi from the Okinomiya bookstore."`
`"Ooishi-san!?"`
`"Is that you, Maebara-san?`
` Good evening. Good to hear you are doing well."`
`"W-Wait just a moment, please!"`
`I grabbed the portable handset and rushed up to my room with it.`
`It was the same no matter where I was since there was no one else home... but I wanted to be in a spot that just felt a bit safer when speaking on the phone with Ooishi-san.`
`"S-Sorry for the wait."`
`"How are things? Anything change since then?"`
`Since then... when was that exactly?`
`...There was something about the brazen way he talked that rubbed me the wrong way.`
`The last time I spoke with Ooishi-san was... two days ago.`
` The day I stayed home from school, I met Ooishi-san on the way back from the hospital... and we headed into town for lunch and had a talk...`
`...Then after that, Rena and Mion came to check up on me.`
`Whenever I spoke with Ooishi-san... they always knew about it.`
`It was like that since the first time I met him.`
`Today's phone call may well be found out by them as well...`
`"Hello...?`
` Can you hear me, Maebara-san?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, sorry...`
` Um... what did you say?"`
`"I asked if anything's changed since last time...`
` There wasn't an answer, so I got a bit worried."`
`"Uh, um... not really..."`
`The words stopped in my throat.`
`There was a ton of stuff that happened.`
` All of it baffling.`
`What should I talk about...? I didn't understand any of it... but I should try asking.`
`If I didn't ask now, I may never have another chance.`
`...This night when my parents weren't home... I had no guarantees I would make it through the night safely, after all.`
`"Well, Ooishi-san... it seems that... someone is after me."`
`"Really!?"`
`"...It could all just be a coincidence... but that day I missed school when I was sick, the two of them came to check up on me."`
`"Which two?"`
`"Rena and Mion.`
` They started asking about how I had lunch with you."`
`"...What next?"`
`"They left me some mochi when they came to visit... but there was a needle inside.`
` Fortunately, I somehow didn't swallow it...`
` I wonder, could that have just been a threat...?"`
`"About the needle..."`
`"...Um, it was just one of those common sewing needles you see all the time.`
` There was a hole to thread string through..."`
`"Not that, Maebara-san, the needle itself...`
` That's evidence.`
` It could be used as proof that they threatened you.`
` Where is that needle?"`
`...Th-That's right... That's it!!!!`
`I dropped the receiver and rushed downstairs.`
`When I tossed the mochi, I had overlooked it out of terror... but that needle was a valuable piece of evidence!`
`Let's see... I threw the mochi and needle at the wall together.`
` If it was there... then it would be on the living room wall!`
`But my prudent mother had cleaned that living room wall, and there was not a trace of mochi left on it.`
`Could it be that it dropped in the gap between the wall and the carpet!?`
`I frantically searched by running my palm along the carpet, but nothing turned up.`
`I tried moving around the sofa and desks, pulling up the carpet, then flapping it around.`
`But I couldn't find the needle...!`
`Did my mom clean up everything without noticing it!?`
`It was just two days ago. I didn't know what day they collected the burnable trash, but it may still be in the trash bin in the kitchen!!`
`I rushed into the kitchen, opened up the lid of the pail, and poured out the contents.`
`But... even at a glance, I could tell that it would be incredibly difficult to find the needle in this pile of trash.`
`I was looking for a needle in a trashstack.`
`I know. I'll try running my hand through it.`
`It was a bit gross, but I was looking for a needle.`
` If I felt a small prick, I'll be able to find it!`
`It was a pretty tactless method, but it was the quickest.`
`I held my breath and started striking the pile of trash with my hand.`
`Filth flew about. There was nothing more disgusting than this, but it was not the time to be concerned about such details!`
`...I continued on for a while, but nothing turned up.`
`I wanted to search more thoroughly, but I was still on the phone.`
` I shouldn't keep Ooishi-san waiting for too long...`
`Later, when Mom got back, I'd have to ask her if there was a needle.`
`I hastily began scribbling on the note pad affixed to the refrigerator with a magnet.`
`"Was there a needle!?"`
`I scrawled the words with a red pen.`
`I then dashed back up the stairs, where I had been keeping Ooishi-san waiting for far too long.`
`"Hello?`
` How did it go?"`
`"...I couldn't find it...`
` I was really overwhelmed when it happened and..."`
`"...I see.`
` It would be great if you could find it.`
` Keep it safe."`
`That's right. The needle wasn't the only incident.`
` I had to tell him about this morning with the hit-and-run.`
`"A-Also, Ooishi-san, that isn't all.`
` ...Actually, this morning..."`
`...That van was definitely aiming for me. I could say that without question due to the circumstances at that time.`
`"Did you see the license plate?`
` I can search for it from here."`
`Damn...!!`
`At the time, I just flipped out yelling at him, but I didn't look at the plate...`
`What failures on my part with the needle and the plate number!`
`I was so focused just protecting myself, that I let some of the most important details slip out of my grasp...!`
`I punched my pillow, annoyed at how worthless I was.`
`"I-I'm sorry... I don't know much more than that it was a white van..."`
`"Nothing to fret about, Maebara-san.`
` Anyone would be shaken up after being hit."`
`"...I guess all of this really... isn't a coincidence, is it?"`
`"..."`
`Ooishi-san started to hem and haw over on the other end.`
`I could imagine him folding his arms...`
`"Also... Rena is acting strange."`
`"...How so?"`
`What Rena said on the way home today...`
` Asking why I was so much like Satoshi-kun.`
`Now I could say it with confidence...`
`That Rena knew what happened to Satoshi.`
`...She knew that there was more to it than him just simply disappearing.`
`"...Rena... knows.`
` She knows something regarding what happened to Satoshi, the kid who was demoned away last year..."`
`"What would that be exactly...?"`
`"...Rena said... I was the same as Satoshi.`
` She said something to the effect that the way things are going... I'll end up with the same fate as Satoshi..."`
`"'Fate,' you say...`
` Exactly what kind of 'fate' did she say would befall you?"`
`"...Um... 'transferring out'... she said."`
`"'Transferring out'?"`
`"Rena said Satoshi 'transferred out.'`
` ...So given how things are going with me, I'll 'transfer out,' too..."`
`Ooishi-san let out a stern sigh and then grumbled loudly.`
`"...Maebara-san, that was probably some sort of threat...`
` or maybe some type of warning."`
`"I thought so too..."`
`At that point... I started to think.`
`Would it be prudent to sum up everything that had happened up until now as the machinations of some human perpetrator?`
`Other than the theory of it being Rena and the others, I was left with Oyashiro-sama's curse actually existing as the only explanation...`
`Of course, I couldn't tell that to Ooishi-san.`
`Except... Rena's strange behavior could be proof of either scenarios.`
`Whether it was Oyashiro-sama's curse being real or everything being part of a conspiracy committed by all of the villagers...`
`Rena was involved...`
`Rena had to know something.`
` Rena was suspicious.`
` What exactly was Rena?`
`I couldn't help but think she was somehow involved with the prior string of mysterious deaths...`
`I seemed to recall that Ooishi-san had admitted that he had... "dug into Rena's past a little."`
`He was probably just downplaying it when he said "a little."`
`...Meaning he had actually dug pretty deep, most likely.`
`...I wanted to hear about Rena.`
`I wanted to know what happened at her previous school... among other things that were still unknown to me.`
`If Rena... was somebody I should suspect...`
` No... not that.`
`...I wanted to know the truth.`
`Tonight, I was alone in this huge house.`
`...Even though I said I couldn't count on them, I had lost the security I felt I had just by my parents being around.`
`It wasn't like this house was some sort of fortress or castle.`
`...If a malicious person decided to use brute force, they'd easily gain entry.`
`There were no other residences close to the Maebara residence.`
` No one would be able to hear anything, no matter how loud it was.`
`I had never felt as much resentment towards my father's artistic temperament and the fact that he had this house built in such a remote location as I did right now...`
`...I wondered if I would still be here by tomorrow morning...`
`So I had to ask.`
` Right now.`
` Because I had no idea when the next chance would come.`
`"Um... Ooishi-san, I have something I wanted to ask about...`
` Please don't keep anything from me."`
`"Sure. Ask away."`
`Even though he was so far away on the other end of the line, this was the most reliable he had ever felt.`
`I wanted to ask...`
`About Rena...`
`About what happened at her previous school...!`
`"...Actually... regarding Rena's—"`
`I noticed a sound that had been going on for a while now.`
`Since I was so focused on the call, I hadn't paid attention to it at first... but I finally realized it was the doorbell.`
`The time was... 7 o'clock.`
`It was past the time the postman would be making a delivery, and past any sensible time for a neighbor to be visiting.`
`I considered just acting like nobody was home, but that wouldn't be good.`
`That would ruin all the work I put in making it look like my parents were home.`
`I need to answer the door.`
`"...Hello? Maebara-san?"`
`"Ah, sorry, someone seems to be at the door. I'm going to go see who it is."`
`"A guest? I see, my apologies.`
` Should we end this phone call now?"`
`That would be a problem!`
`"Ah, no, I'll be back in a second!`
` Do you mind if I just leave the phone on!?"`
`"...It's fine. I don't mind."`
`I dropped the handset on my bed and dashed down to the door.`
`I needed to make up a good excuse to get them to leave.`
`I had a hunch it was the lady who called right before Ooishi-san did.`
`...In which case it would be one of the neighbors who's friends with my mom.`
`I'll just say Mom isn't feeling well and went to bed early...`
` That would be the easiest option.`
`It'd be hard for her to ask me to wake my mom up if she's not feeling well.`
`The bell continued to ring at regular intervals.`
`...If someone didn't answer after you rang the bell so much, you'd normally give up and go home, wouldn't you...?`
`Without removing the chain, I opened the door slightly... and peered out at the visitor.`
`...A chill ran down my spine.`
`I knew it.`
`...Somewhere deep inside, I had prepared for this moment.`
`...I had tried to 'escape' by imagining it was the easiest person to deal with: one of my mom's friends.`
`"...Good evening."`
`"R... Rena..."`
`There shouldn't be any reason for Rena to come over at this hour.`
`The timing also made me feel uneasy.`
`...Because it was just as I was about to ask Ooishi-san about Rena.`
`I wish I could have chalked this up to mere coincidence.`
`But... those unsettling words from Mion several days ago echoed back to me...`
`"...There's nothing`
` this old man doesn't know."`
`"A-Are you alone, Rena...?"`
`"...Yeah."`
`It seems that Mion wasn't with her...`
` But that didn't change the situation at all.`
`"Why did you come here...?"`
`"...Hey, Keiichi-kun, I'd like you to open the door so we can talk...`
` Can I come inside, I wonder? ...I wonder?"`
`It was true that speaking through a chained door wasn't the right way to talk to a classmate.`
` But...`
`"At my house, the chain has to be on at night.`
` Don't worry about it."`
`"...`
`Then... it can't be helped, I guess."`
`Rena looked at the ground sadly.`
`But she kept smiling at least, and her effort to keep that smile up was quite pitiful.`
`...Even though she was tugging at my heartstrings, I didn't lower my guard.`
`As long as I stayed like this, even if it made my heart ache, my life wasn't in danger.`
`What I really feared... more than the possibility that hoodlums would assault me if I removed the chain...`
` was trusting Rena enough to remove the chain... and having my friendship betrayed.`
`As long as the chain wasn't unlatched... even if it made my heart ache, I wouldn't have to deal with being betrayed by Rena.`
`Since it didn't seem like I'd remove the chain from her silent urging, she appeared to give up on trying to get into the entranceway.`
`"...Um, have you... eaten yet, Keiichi-kun?"`
`No, I haven't eaten.`
`Since my mom wasn't there, dinner wouldn't be ready no matter how long I waited.`
`I laid down when I got home, was woken up by the phone, and didn't have a chance to eat since I used up all that time talking.`
`...I was going to have cup noodles in any case. I could just eat one whenever I wanted to.`
`"...No... not yet.`
` What about it?"`
`"H-Heheheh, then good☆`
` Look here.`
` I brought a bunch of dishes."`
`Rena held out a stack of boxes wrapped in a cloth.`
`"I-If I could use your kitchen, I can heat up the miso soup and other stuff.☆"`
`"It's fine, you don't need to do that..."`
`"But... but, there's a lot of tofu and vegetables in it!`
` Does Keiichi-kun not like that type of stuff, I wonder? ...I wonder?"`
`There's no way I wouldn't like that.`
`I love miso soup with lots of ingredients.`
`White radish, carrots, burdock root and potatoes... Dense and fibrous root vegetables...`
` Yeah... that miso soup... looks incredible.`
`"I also brought rice, so if you microwave it, it'll be ready to eat in no time.☆"`
`Without a doubt, rice needs miso soup!`
` Stuffing rice down your gullet, sipping miso soup in between ravenous bites...`
` Oh, yes, how wonderful it is to be born Japanese...!!`
`"Also... I made some more pickles☆`
` I made sansai pickles this time!"`
`Before I had moved here to Hinamizawa, I scoffed at the mountain vegetables called sansai.`
`But... I was captivated by their charm the first time I tried them!`
`Such a deep, yet light, flavor.`
`Those so-called supermarket vegetables taste rough and overpowering in comparison!`
`If you had to describe them, then they were the vegetables for the uninitiated.`
`To become an expert such as myself, you first had to partake of sansai.`
`It was common knowledge around here that the Ryuugu family's traditional pickles were wonderfully delicious!`
`...Ahh, no matter what kind of pickles they were...`
`They'd go so well with that fluffy white rice...!!`
`"...And also... And also...!"`
`But wait, there's more!!`
`So delicious... It just seems so delicious!!`
`Farewell to my unhealthy self who said he'd make do with cup noodles!`
`Rena appeared to be in good spirits and she was offering such a delicious-sounding dinner.`
`...The stress evaporated from my gut and hunger reared its voracious head...`
`At the same time, my wariness of Rena suddenly dwindled...`
`Rena did say she was alone... It shouldn't be a problem letting her inside...`
`Though, the possibility that it was laced with poison still hadn't been ruled out...`
`...At that moment, a cold chill ran down my spine once again.`
`I couldn't understand why such a sensation had occurred just then.`
`...But... the voice inside me... was sounding the alarm.`
`...This happy Rena speaking of this charming dinner... was dependent on one premise.`
`And that premise was that tonight, dinner hadn't been made at my house...`
` Meaning it was under the assumption that my mom, who should be making it, wasn't here.`
`At any normal household, 7 o'clock would be around the middle of dinner time.`
`If my mom were here, we'd be eating dinner around this time as well.`
`The fact that she brought over all the makings of a meal at this time was inherently strange.`
`...Unless she knew...`
`Rena...`
` Did she...`
` Did she know that my parents weren't home?`
`But... there was also the chance that this was a bluff.`
`...I had turned on the lights and a bunch of other stuff to make it seem like my parents were here.`
`...There was a chance that Rena was unsure if my parents were home.`
`But... I had to wonder...`
` The laundry, the garage, the evening paper...`
` There were plenty of signs of them being hastily tidied up.`
`...It was hard to say that Rena didn't have a chance to determine if my parents were here or not...`
`But... there was no reason for me to confess that right now...`
`I should try holding on to that fact as long as I could...`
`First of all, the chain was still latched.`
`As long as I didn't take it off, Rena wouldn't be able to do anything to me...`
`"I... I'm quite grateful... but dinner will be ready pretty soon."`
`"Huh...?`
` Is that so?`
` Is that so...?"`
`"...I know you went through all the effort and everything but... well..."`
`Unable to think of a good way to refuse, my words trailed off weakly...`
`"But... some of this could work as side dishes, I think... I think."`
`"I'm sorry... We have more than enough already...`
` My mom always makes quite a few sides.`
` So..."`
`"Huh...? You have side dishes?"`
`With a smile that bordered on a cringe, I dodged her questions apologetically...`
`But... the feeling I tried to ignore... began creeping up my back again.`
`I spoke as if my mom was setting down dinner right now... but it didn't mesh well with what Rena was saying.`
`Rena was talking as if she was aware of some obvious fact.`
`And that... I was aware of it as well.`
`"So Keiichi-kun can cook.`
` What did you make, I wonder?"`
`"...N-No, well... It's not that I..."`
`Rena had assumed out of nowhere that I had made the dishes.`
`No... not so much that I'd made them... but rather that my mom hadn't.`
`"...Did you really make them?`
` The side dishes?`
` Did you, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"I-It wasn't me... who made them...`
` My mom did... no, she's making them...`
` Right now!"`
`"..."`
`"So you see... I'm sorry, but I can't eat what you brought..."`
`Rena fell silent at that moment.`
` At that moment... I felt that the light had suddenly disappeared from her eyes.`
`"...How about I try guessing what Keiichi-kun's dinner will be?"`
`"I-It... doesn't matter what I'm going to eat..."`
`"...Let's see..."`
`The conversation might appear natural at first glance, but Rena was firmly in control.`
`...It felt like I was being interrogated.`
`"...Your dinner... I wonder, is it something that can be made with just hot water?"`
`"H-Hey, now, stop with the insults!`
` I can't believe you'd belittle my mom's extravagant dinner like that...!!`
` Tickets sold out, full capacity already... It's that amazing..."`
`I tried my best to put on a strong front, but I couldn't grit my teeth quite right.`
`...So instead, I looked like someone who was borderline hysterical...`
`But Rena showed no reaction whatsoever, even to that silliness.`
`"...Keiichi-kun...`
` Did your mother... really leave you dinner...?"`
`"No, you see, she didn't leave me dinner... she's making it right now!`
` It's almost time for dinner...!"`
`Rena had taken that assertion of mine... that my mother was home and making dinner right now... and was completely ignoring it.`
`I could tell that the more I panicked... the colder Rena became.`
`"Hey, Keiichi-kun."`
`...At that moment, an uncomfortable chill crept in from the gap in the doorway...`
`"Is your mom... home, I wonder?`
` ...`
`I wonder?"`
`I couldn't... keep up this charade anymore.`
`Rena...`
` She knew full well that my parents weren't home.`
`But... I'd come too far to admit that now.`
`Anyway... my parents were here and we'd be having dinner soon... that was the situation I had concocted...!!`
`So I answered...`
`I told her she was here.`
`"S-She's here... Of course...!"`
`I could feel the humidity drying out from the surrounding air.`
`...Rena's eyes were becoming even more frigid, piercing me with their gelid glare...`
`"...Why?"`
`"Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean...?"`
`I tried acting casual... but that facade... was torn off me the instant I looked into Rena's eyes.`
`That look... It informed me of Rena's response faster than she could open her mouth...`
`"...Why have you been... lying to me, I wonder? ...I wonder..."`
`"I...`
` I'm not lying..."`
`"...That's a lie, isn't it?"`
`"...It's not a lie..."`
`"LIES!!!!"`
`Rena's outburst sent a jolt surging through my body...!!`
`Rena and I were still separated by what few inches that slightly ajar, but still-chained door could afford.`
`But despite that, I was still being cornered.`
`My house, which I'd considered a safe haven until now, had become more like a dark alleyway where no one could save me.`
`"...Shall I guess your dinner, Keiichi-kun? Let's see..."`
`I knew now that Rena had already known that my parents would not be here tonight.`
`...But it was still so strange that it had come to this...!`
`Even if she somehow knew that my parents weren't home...`
` There was no way she should be able to guess what I'd be eating tonight...!!`
`But Rena said she'd guess...`
` How could she guess it!?`
` How could she know it was instant—`
`"Cup noodles...`
` That's right, isn't it?"`
`—that I was going to eat...!?`
`Wait... the cooking repertoire of a man who can't do housework is probably nothing but cup noodles, after all.`
`...Looking at this statistically, it was the most probable answer.`
`...That didn't mean... she was guessing...!!!`
`"...I don't think you'll be full with just noodles.`
` I think having rice and stuff will definitely hit the spot."`
`Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...`
`This was just coincidence.`
`...Rena was just reading certain tells of mine.`
`...So the fact that she was inferring what I was thinking alarmed me.`
`But it wasn't as if she was actually reading my mind.`
`If it was being read, then she was a demon.`
`...No, not a demon.`
` Things like that...`
` they couldn't possibly exist.`
`"...Do you like them?"`
`"Do you mean... noodles?"`
`"No...`
` *******."`
`Rena indicated that the point my answer was addressing was wrong.`
`Her rebuttal was so short that I momentarily didn't understand the words Rena had spoken.`
`"...S-Sorry, Rena...`
` What did you say just now?"`
`"Huh?`
` About what?"`
`"Just now... You asked me if there was something that I liked, didn't you?"`
`It wasn't long before I regretted how carelessly I'd pushed forward with that question.`
`It was such a simple answer... That was why I wasn't able to comprehend it.`
`"...Pork-bone & Ginger flavor."`
`I wondered how I appeared in the moments my mind went completely blank until the moment I was able to recover.`
`As my field of view began to distort--slowly swirling in a counter-clockwise direction--I lost all sense of balance...`
`"Why do you know that!?"`
`I didn't even deny it.`
` That was the type of frenzied state I was in.`
`...How could Rena... know even this!?`
`Not even caring as I mashed my head against the door, I fixated my gaze on Rena.`
`...But she didn't even flinch when she saw me do that.`
`"I certainly did buy them.`
` I bought a bunch at once.`
` I bought a whole case!`
` How could you know that!?"`
`"...Why, I wonder?`
` Quite strange, isn't it?`
` ...Isn't it?"`
`How could you dodge the question at a time like this!?`
`The chain and the door suddenly were no longer protecting me.`
`"How do you know!?`
` Why do you know!?`
` Answer me!!!!"`
`"...You bought them at Seventh Mart...`
` didn't you?"`
`A shiver ran up my spine...`
`I tried covering it up with an angry facade.`
`"Like I said... why do you know that!?!?"`
`"...I was behind you... following you the whole time."`
`"Wh... What are you saying...!?"`
`I couldn't understand why she was saying she'd been following me all this time.`
`"That's because...`
` I was...`
` right behind...`
` Keiichi-kun's back...`
` the whole time...`
` Hehahahaha."`
`Like that night...?`
`That night I was absorbed in my phone conversation with Ooishi-san. I didn't even sense her being there... Standing behind the door... behind me... standing there... Just like that!?!?`
`"When Keiichi-kun was picking out the noodles, I was watching the entire time.`
`You picked out so many different flavors, didn't you?`
` Then your mom got angry...`
` If you were going to pick the expensive ones, then you should just pick one type, she said.`
`Then you picked out that big box of Pork-bone & Ginger flavor that you love so much, didn't you☆?`
` I like it too...`
` Pork-bone noodles.`
` But I can never eat a whole big bowl myself."`
`My brain was paralyzed, dulling my senses.`
`It might have been a defense mechanism... to diminish the fear I was feeling to non-traumatizing levels.`
`With the fear being diminished... The fog enveloping my mind was cleared away.`
`Then... I could understand what Rena was saying and started to put meaning behind her words...`
`Even so, my fear hadn't subsided completely.`
`...It was like... I was standing at the edge of a cliff, eyes closed so I didn't have to look down. It didn't actually solve any of the basic problems.`
`I slowly took a step backwards.`
` And as I withdrew... Rena advanced.`
`"...So Keiichi-kun...`
` Can you open this?`
` We can eat dinner together☆`
` I'm sure it's going to be delicious, so... okay...?"`
`Rena's pale, slender fingers squirmed through the crack in the door one at a time, as if they had a mind of their own, rattling the chain...`
`If she had unlatched the chain from the door, a feeling of terror would have just exploded within me.`
`...But Rena didn't do that.`
`She was simply imploring me to remove the chain.`
`I tried my hardest to light the fuse to the powder keg in my heart...`
` Trying again and again.`
` *clatter clatter*`
` ...But it doesn't light...`
` It doesn't light!`
`"...Open up?`
` Keiichi-kun...?"`
`"P... Please go away...`
` I beg you... please go away...!!"`
`"...How can you say something so mean, I wonder...?`
` ...I wonder?"`
`"Please go away!!`
` Go away!!!!`
` GO AWAAAAAY!!!!"`
`The powder keg inside me finally went off.`
`No smoldering—it just exploded.`
`I tackled the door.`
`The force through the door had knocked Rena momentarily off-balance.`
`I couldn't hesitate here...!!`
`I grabbed onto the doorknob with both hands, planted my feet firmly, and pulled with all my might!!`
`But that slamming sound I so desired didn't happen.`
`I could feel a tiny, disturbing bit of resistance keeping the door from closing.`
`And the source of that was... Rena's fingers.`
`Each of those fingers wriggling... squirming around like the tendrils of a carnivorous plant through the crack in the doorway...!`
`"It hurts...`
` It hurts, Keiichi-kun...`
` It hurts...`
` Uwh..."`
`It wasn't a harsh shriek, but more of a yelp she was trying to keep back.`
`"Go away... go away... go away...!!!"`
`I kept on pulling on the door with all my might...!!`
`I didn't even realize that if I didn't loosen my pull on the door at least momentarily, Rena wouldn't be able to pull her fingers out, and that was why the door wasn't closing.`
`"...It really hurts, Keiichi-kun...`
` I'm sorry if I was messing around too much...`
` Uuwh..."`
`I didn't care one bit for her apology.`
`No matter how much she apologized, it didn't change any of what she had done up until now...`
` It didn't change anything!`
`"It huurts...`
` It huurts...`
` I'm sorry...`
` I'm sorry...`
` I'm sorry..."`
`"Go away, go away!!`
` GO AWAAAAAAAAY!!"`
`Rena couldn't leave even if she wanted to because I'd trapped her fingers...`
`Rena's white fingers had become deep red and were no longer even squirming.`
`"I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry..."`
`"Go away, go away, go away...!!!"`
`"I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry."`
`Rena's apologies were occasionally twisted with pain... but like a broken record... she was intent on repeating it over and over...`
`Go away,`
` go away,`
` go away...`
` STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!`
`I pulled on the door even harder!!!`
`Finally, Rena's fingers were somehow able to slip out from their imprisonment in the doorway.`
`The moment that happened, the door closed soundly, and I could hear the thud of Rena falling on her butt on the other side.`
`I locked the door immediately.`
`It made a loud clunk, voicing my rejection to Rena.`
`"I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` ...Keiichi-kun,`
` I'm sorry...`
` Open up... Keiichi-kun..."`
`Rena leaned against the door, apologizing profusely and nothing else.`
`After confirming that I was sufficiently sealed off from her, I trudged away from the entryway.`
`On the other side, I could still hear Rena echoing her apology: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." Those pitiful words, they would be forever seeking my forgiveness.`
`I didn't feel bad about this at all.`
`But that wasn't out of any sort of malice.`
`I just... I felt a sort of hazy sense of relief that I was able to escape from Rena.`
`Before, Mion had threatened me at this doorway... saying there was nothing she didn't know.`
`And just now, at the same place... Rena told me the same thing.`
`...My feeble attempts to disguise the fact my parents weren't home had served no purpose from the start.`
`...I should have just pretended to be out, and not even opened the door!`
`My meager plans hadn't helped at all.`
`In Hinamizawa... it was impossible... to outwit 'Them'...!`
`Even though I was on the other side of the door, I wanted to get as far away from Rena as possible.`
`One step, two steps... With each one, her sniveling apologies became more distant...`
`I sprinted up the stairs and dove into my room.`
`...As you would expect, I was finally no longer able to hear Rena repeating her endless apology.`
`Diving into my bed, I was startled by the hard lump I felt...`
`There was something... in my bed!?!?`
`...It was the receiver.`
`I finally remembered.`
` I was in the middle of a call with Ooishi-san.`
`Looking at the clock, apparently not much time had passed since I went downstairs.`
`Could it be that my clock had run out of batteries...??`
`I had talked with Rena for so long... How did almost no time pass...!?`
`But the hand on the clock... was ticking forward one second every second as usual...`
`As I put the still-warm receiver to my ear... time—which felt frozen— began moving once again.`
`"...Hello... Ooishi-san?`
` Sorry to keep you waiting."`
`"No, not at all. I didn't wait that long."`
`It became apparent that the amount of time that had passed between myself and Ooishi-san was different.`
`Over the phone, I could hear an energetic voice from a sports program or something. It drove home just how far away Ooishi-san really was...`
`"...Rena came just now."`
`"Did she come to play?"`
`"..."`
`I wasn't confident that I could coherently explain the situation to Ooishi-san.`
`But I didn't need to right now. Right now, I needed to know about Rena.`
`That's right. I was planning to ask Ooishi-san more about Rena, but Rena's little visit had interrupted the conversation...`
`What was true and what was false... I couldn't tell.`
`The one thing I knew was the single grim reality that Rena was suspicious.`
`I might be able to figure something out if I asked Ooishi-san about her.`
`...Up until now, I had regretted it whenever I forced myself to ask about things that I was better off not knowing.`
`But... looking at it that way, you could say I'd hit rock bottom.`
`There was no possible way I could feel any more regret than I did right now.`
`No... rather, I wanted to know if there was anything beyond this I would regret more.`
`Forget about tomorrow, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility for something to happen tonight.`
`I wanted to know everything I could.`
`...I was absolutely not going to die like this.`
`...Not without knowing anything. I definitely won't...!`
`"Regarding Rena Ryuugu-san?`
` I did a bit of digging.`
` Yeah, well... it wasn't much."`
`I understood that Ooishi-san was talking in circles.`
` "A bit" meant, "I dug so deep it'd be hard to discuss with you since you're her friend."`
`"I want to know everything from your research."`
`"...I don't think you'll be very interested in what I have to say, though."`
`"Ooishi-san."`
`I spoke as calmly as possible to Ooishi-san, who was continuing to avoid the issue.`
`And then... I said it.`
`"I think Rena Ryuugu is suspicious.`
`Even if the past incidents were from Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` Rena Ryuugu is involved."`
`"Do you have some sort of proof that makes you believe Rena-san is suspicious?"`
`The manner in which Ooishi-san spoke became very firm.`
`...Do you have some sort of proof?`
`That was him talking as a detective.`
`"I only have circumstantial evidence."`
`"...I see."`
`I could tell even over the phone how disappointed Ooishi-san was.`
`Pulling on the fishing line when he felt a bite, only to reel in the bait.`
` Disappointed, but ready to cast the line once more... that's how it seemed.`
`"Ooishi-san...`
` You can't do anything... without physical proof, can you?"`
`What I meant was: you can't come and save me without proof?`
` I stuck that barb in there.`
`As Ooishi-san loved roundabout ways of saying things, he understood me just fine.`
`"It's fine, Maebara-san.`
` I'll protect you."`
`...That was not the least bit reassuring.`
`Ooishi-san was just using me to continue his investigation.`
`I was just going to get killed, and my corpse would be an important piece of evidence. That was all I was to him.`
`"Whether I'm alive or dead may be of no concern to your investigation, but it's all over for me when I die!"`
`Ooishi-san went silent on the other end of the line.`
`...That may have been too blunt, but I didn't care.`
`...All I needed to relay to Ooishi-san was that I was currently in a very dangerous position.`
`"So please, tell me.`
` Tell me about Rena."`
`"..."`
`"Satoshi transferred out...`
` Not too far in the future, I'll probably also do what Rena called 'transferring out' as well.`
` But you won't be able to find my corpse...`
`You haven't even been able to find Satoshi's body yet!!"`
`"All right, Maebara-san, please calm down..."`
`I was already suppressing my agitation, even without Ooishi-san having to tell me...`
`It wouldn't solve anything if I continued to scream about my mistrust in the police.`
`It would seem that I could only depend on myself and the bat Satoshi left behind to protect myself.`
`Then I at least wanted to know about what happened before Rena transferred schools.`
`"...You're aware that this won't be very interesting, right?"`
`Ooishi-san, realizing my resolve couldn't be swayed, finally caved.`
`"Right now, to me, there is nothing that I'll find uninteresting.`
` Please..."`
`"...There are a few things I need you to agree to."`
`"Okay."`
`"Please keep this confidential.`
`Also, part of this may be speculation.`
` Not all of it may be true...`
` Are you still interested?"`
`"It might not be true...?`
` I don't understand what you mean."`
`"There isn't one main investigation for the mysterious chain of deaths in Hinamizawa.`
` Each one is treated as its own individual case.`
`Thus, Rena Ryuugu has never been linked to any of the investigations.`
` Basically, you see..."`
`"...This isn't an investigation of Rena done by the police...`
` and is a personal inquiry, is what you're telling me?"`
`"...This'll make things a lot quicker since you understand...`
` All of it is from either phone calls or meetings and interviews.`
` So they aren't corroborated. `
`I'm asking you to take this all with a grain of salt... is what I mean.`
` Do we have an agreement?"`
`"...All of it is just from what you heard?"`
`"Yes, my apologies. It's all my personal investigation, you see."`
`"That thing...`
` before, you said you saw Rena's chart, didn't you?`
` I'm sure I heard you say that."`
`Ooishi-san paused for a moment on the other end of the line.`
`"...I told you that, too? Huahaha!`
` Please pretend you didn't hear anything about that."`
`I didn't care about Ooishi-san having certain obligations and responsibilities.`
`I also didn't care if there was no proof.`
`Even if they were just rumors, there's no smoke without fire, after all.`
`"...Please tell me. Ooishi-san."`
`"Understood..."`
`Ooishi-san finally opened those tight lips of his.`
`It seemed that Rena lived in Hinamizawa a long time ago.`
`She had moved to Ibaraki Prefecture just before starting elementary school.`
`Then... following that...`
` right after transferring...`
`The unfortunate incident with the breaking of the school windows happened.`
`Then Rena confided to the doctor.`
`"It was Oyashiro-sama."`
`This was everything I knew.`
`"...There isn't much difference between what I know and what you know, Maebara-san."`
`"Then what part did you investigate further...?"`
`I didn't need to ask.`
`...It was the incident right before she transferred back to Hinamizawa.`
`"The incident Rena was responsible for... and what she divulged to the doctor afterwards...`
` correct?"`
`"...Yes."`
`"After you learned about that, you started suspecting Rena and the others, didn't you?"`
`"...Yes, I did suspect them."`
`"So they're the ones, after all...?"`
`"Ah, no... That's not what I meant by suspect them."`
`?`
`Ooishi-san was the type of person to say things with confidence, but these particular words were less than reassuring.`
`"Then... who did you suspect?"`
`"...That it was...`
` Oyashiro-sama."`
`"Huh?"`
`"...That Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` really exists...`
` Yeah, right, well... hahahaha...!"`
`Ooishi-san's laugh was quite dry, certainly not the kind that would make you want to join in.`
`Ooishi-san resumed the conversation.`
`About the dubious circumstances behind Satoshi's disappearance.`
`...The course of events leading him to delve into Rena's past.`
`Just then, there was thunder in the distance, and a heavy rain started pouring down.`
`It came without warning, a downpour fiercely beating the ground.`
`I had left the window in my room open a crack to let the heat out. The violent wind danced into my room, making the curtains flap wildly.`
`"What is it?"`
`"Ah, nothing, it suddenly started raining heavily...`
` Sorry, please continue..."`
`I got up while still on the phone and grasped the window.`
`"I said at the beginning it was an incident, but because neither the school nor the victims filed charges, the police were never involved.`
`...So, you see... those involved... were very reluctant to talk.`
` Regardless of there being a victim who had one eye beaten so badly that it had permanent damage...`
`It could have been the school or possibly some individual who made arrangements to keep this from going public.`
` Also, the psychologist was very strict about their professional ethics...`
` Hello...?`
` Maebara-san? `
`Can you hear me?"`
`There was the figure of a person standing by the light near the mailbox this whole time.`
`Even in this torrential rain. They didn't have an umbrella.`
` They were unquestionably drenched from head to toe...`
` In this shower which more resembled a waterfall... droplets of water dripped down from her hair...`
`Just standing there... both arms dangling at her side...`
`In one hand... was the stack of boxes, wrapped in cloth.`
`Her eyes... focused on my room...`
` Focused on me as I was about to close the window.`
`Her mouth... was methodically repeating... a chewing motion.`
`It was as if she had something hard to chew in her mouth... with her cheeks puffing out.`
`What could she... be eating... over there...?`
`How could it be that at this time... I was more enthralled by Rena... instead of the shocking developments being brought to light by Ooishi-san...`
`If it hadn't started raining, I wouldn't have gone to the window.`
`Then I wouldn't have noticed Rena, nor would I have noticed... "that"...`
`Rena's mouth was moving in the same pattern.`
`She wasn't eating something... she was repeating something.`
`What was it?`
`Was she repeating...?`
`To me...?`
`What was she saying...?`
`And why was I... right up against the window... fixated on her...?`
`"Hello?`
` Maebara-san?`
` Can you hear me?`
` Hellooo..."`
`"I'm sorry."`
`"Huh? Maebara-san?"`
`"I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry..."`
`"Hello?`
` Maebara-san!?`
` What's the matter...!?"`
`Even in this torrential downpour... Rena was still apologizing...`
`The other self inside me drew the curtain hastily with my right hand, blocking my view of the outside.`
`But even doing that, Rena's relentless apologies still reached my ears.`
`I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry...`
`If I forgive you for this... will you forgive me for that!?`
`Please stop,`
` please stop,`
` please stop,`
` please stop...!`
`I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry...`
`Dammit...!!`
` Why should I... have to forgive her!?`
`I'm the one who wants to be forgiven!`
`What part of me can't you forgive!?`
`I won't be killed!`
`If you won't forgive me, then I won't forgive you, either.`
`...I won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` won't forgive,`
` I won't forgive...!!`
`"Maebara-san?`
` If you can hear me, then please respond.`
` ...Hellooo!!"`
