`If I was going to be ripped apart anyways,`
` having my body ripped apart would've been far better.`
`I trusted her.`
`...No, I still trust her.`
`Even in this very moment, I trust her.`
`But... I'm starting to realize.`
`I only wanted to trust her because I refused to accept the truth.`
`It was as if I was trying to convince myself,`
` in such a silly... sobbing voice...`
`And those tears... those tears making a mess of my face...`
`That mechanical, repetitious sound finally stilled, and everything fell silent.`
`Only the cry of the cicadas remained, annoyingly loud.`
`And yet...`
`...I felt as if I could still hear her voice.`
`...But that's not possible.`
`She is no longer speaking.`
`The only one crying is me.`
`She never cried.`
`Even when she repeated those words over and over, she never expressed any emotion, because there were none to show.`
`If she had no tears to shed for me,`
` then I...`
` shouldn't need to shed any for her.`
`Then why... this pain, my eyes getting moist... why was this happening?`
`I still wanted to believe... I hadn't been split apart.`
`That's enough, right?`
`Inside me, an inner voice whispered gently...`
`My spirit had suffered enough...`
`...and countless times I'd wavered over whether I should just throw the battered thing away.`
`Except... I've stubbornly refused to do that, haven't I?`
`I'd feel better if I just threw it away.`
`Even knowing that, I chose to believe, didn't I?`
`Only I can understand that painful struggle, and appreciate it.`
`Hey, me?`
`...I've tried more than enough.`
`...I'll acknowledge that much.`
`So...`
`...Isn't it all right to just take the easy way out?`
`Besides... I'm not throwing it away.`
`I'm leaving it behind, with her.`
`...Like flowers by a grave.`
`Now then.`
`...Calm your nerves.`
`Even though you can't feel your right arm.`
`...Just lift it up.`
`And with every swing, forget a little more.`
`That kindness made me happy.`
`That adorable smile brought me joy.`
`I liked petting your head.`
`I loved how demure you were.`
`...Because this will be the last time.`
`Because when I swing this down, I'll forget.`
`This is... my...`
`First and last...`
` bouquet for you.`
`Perhaps... I really did...`
`...`
`...love you.`
