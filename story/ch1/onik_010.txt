`"Good morning~!`
` Nice job yesterday, Kei-chan!"`
`"You didn't do so badly yourself, Mion!`
` Yesterday was fun!"`
`"Oh, that's right. Keiichi-kun, thank you very much!`
` For Mr. Bear!"`
`"I'm glad you like it. Don't use it as a pin cushion, though."`
`"I-I wouldn't...!"`
`Still chatting happily, we entered the classroom. But the moment I stepped into the room...`
` a splashing sound and a nasty sensation.`
`It was a bucket filled to the brim with water.`
`And unfortunately, my foot stepped right into it.`
`"My, now. How diligent of you to mop the floor this morning~!"`
`*clomp clomp clomp*`
` *fwip*`
` *bwif*`
`"B-Bwaaaaahh!!`
` Keiichi-san flicked my forehead~!!"`
`"You should set a more brutal trap next time."`
`Seeing that, Rena began to swoon as Mion looked on in disbelief.`
`Everything was the same as always.`
`Everybody was there and nothing felt out of place.`
`The uncertainties I'd had in the back of my mind since yesterday had vanished.`
`"What is it, Keiichi-kun?`
` Didn't get enough sleep, maybe?`
` Maybe?"`
`"I slept like a log. But if you want, I'll do a reenactment during class."`
`"You shouldn't do that...!"`
`Mion alerted us that the teacher was coming, so everyone shuffled off to their seats.`
`"Good morning, everyone.`
` So yesterday was the festival.`
` Thank you to all the people who stayed until the very end to help clean up."`
`We were all slackers, so none of us actually helped clean up.`
`...Actually, I had a feeling that the only thing we did was run around the festival and cause a ruckus...`
`"Okay then. This time of year, you might see some people here from out of town doing interviews about the festival for magazines."`
`I thought it was the usual stuff so I was going to tune it out, but then I noticed the different tone in her voice and started paying attention.`
`"You may be asked questions. Please don't say anything silly or something that could be taken the wrong way.`
` ...Do you understand?"`
`In unison, everyone replied, "Yes, ma'~~am!"`
`What she'd said was really vague, but I understood what she was trying to say.`
`After all, this was the fifth year.`
`There were probably lots of third-rate reporters pouring in, hoping something regarding the curse had happened.`
`It did nothing but perpetuate the village's bad image.`
`She was saying, "Don't spout stupid shit you think is funny."`
`And now, I was one of ones who needed to keep their mouths shut.`
`I found it rather cute how I felt a sense of unity from such a trite thing, if I do say so myself.`
`I was summoned to club activities after school.`
`Since everybody was still pretty tired from yesterday, we just spent the day relaxing peaâ€” Yeah, that wasn't happening!`
`"Today, let's play a classic game of deduction!`
` How about this one!?"`
`"Oh! A game from overseas!`
` Looks interesting!"`
`"The instructions are in English.`
` ...But the rules don't seem that hard!"`
`"...I-I won't lose, you hear."`
`"I'm not too bad at this game."`
`It seemed that Rena didn't handle this kind of game very well.`
`"The rules are... The person who can match the murderer, weapon, and the scene of the crime wins!"`
`There were three kinds of cards comprised of suspects, weapons, and locations.`
`I could see that the names "Mion" and "Rika" were written on the suspect cards.`
` Oh~ A card with my name on it as well!`
`"There are plenty of different weapons, too!`
` Like knives, axes, and poison!`
` The locations are pretty nice too!`
` Like the living room, the study, and the courtyard!"`
`"So basically...`
` You take out one of each of the cards.`
` These are the answer cards."`
`"So we shuffle the remaining cards and hand them out.`
` We ask each other about the cards and figure out the right ones!"`
`Ahhh, I see. So the cards nobody has are the true perpetrators.`
`"Then you raise your hand if you know the answer!`
` The game ends and we check if the answer is correct."`
`"If you're right, then you get a point!`
` If you're wrong, then you lose a point!`
` Since the game ends even if no one gets it right, all the cards are gathered up and redistributed!"`
`"You'll learn as you go!`
` You really have to use your brain!"`
`"You'll get confused if you don't take notes."`
`"The rest you can figure out by playing... So, Mion!`
` What's the penalty this time!?"`
`Everyone directed their attention to Mion!`
`"Let's see...`
` We're all still a little tired from yesterday, so maybe we'll take it easy with a gofer penalty?`
` You'll be asked to rush out and buy stuff for everyone!"`
`"So just being asked to go buy stuff like drinks and candy, I guess."`
`"...I feel like the penalty today is pretty simple."`
`...I wonder... Is it really?`
`"Is Keiichi-san thinking what I'm thinking?"`
`"Yeah...`
` You don't know what you'll have to go buy."`
`I'm betting Mion would send out whoever loses to buy stuff like "hemorrhoid cream" or "Happy family planning manual" or other crazy stuff!!`
`The cards were lightly shuffled and passed out to each player.`
`The real perpetrator, the correct weapon, and the scene of the murder have been taken out, so that means all the cards I have in my hand are 'innocent' cards.`
`"Then~ I'll go first since I'm the club president, I guess...`
` Well, then...`
` 'Mion,'`
` 'Knife,'`
` 'Study'!"`
`You pick one suspect, weapon, and murder scene and ask the other players.`
`If you have any of those cards, then you must say "I have one." However, you don't need to say which one you have.`
`"Yeah, I got it."`
`"Me too."`
`"...I have one."`
`"Oh my, all of them are here."`
`Three people answered when she asked if they had "Mion," "Knife," and "Study."`
`So that means that "Mion" and "Knife" and "Study" are all in the clear. Got to jot that down...`
`"Then I'll go...`
` 'Rena,'`
` 'Axe,'`
` 'Lounge'!"`
`Hrm, only two people said they had one?`
` So it means... out of "Rena," "Axe," and "Lounge," one of them is correct and is part of the crime!?`
`No, wait. Even if they say they have one, they don't have to say how many!`
`It's possible that either Satoko or Rika-chan has two of the cards...!!`
`"Well, Kei-chan is next. Go ahead!"`
`"W-Wa-wait just a little...!`
` I'm still sorting things out!"`
`...The game has me thinking more than I thought...!`
` Oh, man, this feels like it's going to be tough!!`
`"All right! Now I have the criminal!!"`
`"What!?`
` Already!?"`
`Here I am spinning around in circles, and Mion just now raises her hand.`
`"The murderer is 'Rika-chan'...`
` ...in the 'Infirmary,' with the 'Poison'!`
` Well!?"`
`Mion drew the cards from the box and we checked to see if her deduction was right...`
`"I was right!!"`
`"Errh~! All I needed was one more hand~!`
` I couldn't tell whether it was 'Poison' or a 'Pistol'~!!"`
`"I'd never use a pistol.`
` I like killing them slowly with poison."`
`Rika-chan said such a hugely terrifying thing with such a sweet little face.`
`Everyone was making a commotion about how they almost had it.`
` Rena and I were left out in the cold, though.`
`"...How did you do, Keiichi-kun...?`
` I couldn't get it at all..."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I had no idea either."`
`"How can you both be so unsure?`
` You'll both end up in last place together at this rate."`
`That's even worse!!`
`Going off buying something together as a couple.`
` What if we ended up having to buy the "Happy family planning manual"...?!`
`"...I can tell from Keiichi's expression that he's not very good at this game."`
`"Wha!`
` That's not true!`
` I'll show you the true power of Sherlock Maebara during the next round!"`
`"My, my~ That sounds just wonderful!!!`
` I shall give you quite the thrashing!"`
`After that, I managed to somewhat grasp the trick behind the game, but I was still always a step or two behind.`
`...I saw that Mion was somehow gleaning information from how the others were asking their questions.`
` ...That level of experience was just too much!`
`The only way I could stage a comeback was if I became ruthless!!!`
`I tossed out the simple concept of deduction and switched over to the thought process needed to win...`
`The important thing isn't to find out the criminal... It's to win at the game...!!`
`...Hm!`
` Eureka!!!`
`"Ah, sorry, need to go to the bathroom."`
`"Take your time and squeeze out a nice one~!"`
`"Mii-chan, that's gross...!"`
`I had them hold off the game and headed down the hall.`
`The air was crisp.`
`It showed just how stagnant the air in the classroom was from our body heat.`
`On the school grounds, some of our classmates were still playing around.`
`After spending some time cooling my head, Rena had made her way over towards me.`
`"...Keiichi-kun, did you call for me?"`
`"Yeah, I did."`
`As I got up from my seat I winked over at Rena.`
`I'm glad it worked out.`
`"I don't want to waste much time, so I'll get right to the point.`
` Rena, what's your record at this game we're playing today?"`
`She was taken aback... after a moment, she hesitantly opened her mouth.`
`"Uh... um... Well... All losses.`
` ...Why do you ask, I wonder... I wonder?"`
`I could tell from how apprehensively she was playing.`
`"The way things are going... I will, as well.`
` I can't figure out a way to pull off a last minute comeback on this one!"`
`"S-Soo... I guess both of us will be taking that penalty...?"`
`"Hey, hey! Don't accept defeat already!`
` How about we win this!?`
` Both of us!"`
`"B-But... How can we!?"`
`I brought my lips up to Rena's ear.`
` *whisper whisper whisper whisper*`
`"Huh? I-Is that allowed!?"`
`"Did you forget, Rena? The second rule of our society!`
` Do everything in your power to obtain victory!"`
`"Y-Yeah! I-I'll try my best."`
`Our plan of attack was a quite rudimentary one.`
`At the beginning of the game, everyone would be focused on their own hand for a while, taking notes and whatnot.`
`Since our seats were right next to each other, we'd reveal our hands to each other!`
`If we did it under the desk, then nobody would know!`
`We'd begin the game with twice as much information as everyone else!`
`Having this much information would mean we'd need to investigate less!!`
`"...With this sort of plan of attack, we start off with a big lead over the other guys!"`
`"Y-Yeah! With this, we can probably win...!"`
`We both smirked at each other.`
`If I was the shady businessman, then Rena was the corrupt senator. Heh heh, pleasure doing business with you!!`
`"Then let's hurry back! We'll work as a duo to surprise everyone!"`
`"Hey, now!`
` There's no point if we go back together!`
` It would be like flat out telling them we made a little arrangement!"`
`"Oh, sorry. Then what should we do...?"`
`"Go back ahead of me, Rena.`
` I'll take my time coming back after washing my face or something."`
`"Okay. Got it!"`
`Rena turned around and headed back to the classroom.`
`Hm, I guess I should wait a bit longer before going back...`
`If I went too soon, it wouldn't seem like I went to the bathroom. If Mion or one of them suspected something, then there could be problems...`
`Well, they'd figure it out sooner or later. Because both Rena and I would start winning over and over again!`
`Both Rena and I will have earned enough points to avoid being the losers by the time Mion realized what was happening!!`
`Excellent!`
` Not bad at all!!`
`"Maebara-kun~`
` May I have a moment?"`
`Huh? It's the teacher.`
` ...Man, things were just getting good!!`
`"What is it? I'm a bit..."`
`"You have a guest.`
` Please make your way to the entrance."`
`"A guest?`
` It's not like I own a hotel..."`
`"They have been waiting. Please hurry."`
`Right before my big match was pretty bad timing to have a visitor, but the very fact that someone was here to see me was strange enough to pique my interest.`
`I didn't want to waste any time, so I decided to take care of it quickly.`
`The entryway was a heavy contrast from the hot sunlight and deep shadows.`
`Waiting there, looking uncomfortably warm, was a middle-aged man, his tie sloppily loosened, and his jacket tucked underneath his arm..`
`"Are you Maebara-san?`
` Keiichi Maebara-san?"`
`There was no question that he wasn't a resident of Hinamizawa, and that this was without a doubt the first time he had met me.`
`...Ever since I met Tomitake-san, it seemed I was fated to meet middle-aged men...`
`"That's right.`
` ...Who might you be?"`
`"I have the AC on in my car; let's talk there.`
` It's a bit hot here, don't you think?"`
`The man, completely ignoring my question, pointed over to his car parked near the gate, and began walking.`
`Y-You've got to be kidding me. I had no intention of going along with some geezer I didn't even know, and he was asking me to get in his car with him!?`
`"I'm not going to bite.`
` Come on, now."`
`He opened the back door of his car and called me over.`
`...I didn't like this old man but I wanted to know what this was about.`
`...Even while knowing that conversations that start out like this have never led to anything good.`
`The inside of his car was pretty cool.`
`Cars with air conditioners were supposed to be a luxury.`
`My dad didn't have one in his car, at least.`
`"Please let me know if it's too cold for you, okay?`
` I have a habit of cranking it all the way up."`
`"So what business do you have with me?"`
`Out of spite, I decided to ignore his remark in the same way he did to me and start my own line of questioning.`
`He pulled out a notepad from his pocket and took out a picture that was stuck between the pages.`
`On it was the face of a pretty goofy looking guy.`
`"If you know anything related to this individual, then please tell me."`
`Who the heck is this?`
`...I doubt even his close friends would be able to recognize who he was from this expressionless picture that looked like it was taken at the DMV.`
`"There were scribbles on his shirt done in permanent marker.`
` Starting with yours, Maebara-san, and quite a few of your classmates signed, as well."`
`"...Huh?`
` ...This is... Tomitake-san!?!?"`
`There was no hint of his usual unreliable and easygoing personality in this photo.`
`It was an expressionless, half-asleep face...`
`"Then do you know this woman?"`
`Even before seeing it, I had a good idea of who it was.`
`"...Uhh, I don't remember her name, but she's some lady who was with Tomitake-san last night."`
`I didn't know what her name was, but I did know she was a resident of Hinamizawa.`
`"When was the last time you saw these two?"`
`"The night of the Watanagashi. We spoke.`
` ...They seemed pretty close, I guess..."`
`"Did anything bother you about them?`
` Anything is fine.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`Being asked for every little detail is very troubling, honestly.`
`...I had a pretty good idea of who this guy was by now.`
`"Did something happen to them?"`
`There was no response to my inquiry.`
`Thus, I replied to that silence in kind.`
`I was pretty sure... no, certain... that this guy was a cop.`
`Then why??`
`Why was he asking about Tomitake-san?`
` Did something happen to him?`
`More importantly, why me?`
`Shouldn't there have been plenty of other people who knew more about him than I did?`
`The roar of the air conditioner felt unbearably loud.`
`...After a long pause, he finally spoke again.`
`"You've moved here just recently. Isn't that right, Maebara-san?`
` Are you aware, I wonder?`
` About the stories`
`...`
` of Oyashiro-sama."`
`My heart began to race.`
`I'm pretty terrible at hiding things.`
` It probably showed on my face...`
`"Not at all?`
` If you don't, then that's fine..."`
`"...Well... I have heard of it.`
` Tomitake-san told me, actually..."`
`"How much do you know about it?"`
`The dismemberment killing.`
` The accidental death.`
` The death by illness, followed by suicide.`
` And the lady who was beaten to death.`
`The incidents that always happen the day of the Watanagashi, ending in suspicious deaths...`
`I didn't think Tomitake-san would have kept anything from me.`
` I think that was everything...`
`...No. Rather, I didn't want to think there was anything more than that.`
`"Maebara-san... do you believe in the curse?`
` Feel free to speak openly about it."`
`"I don't believe in it."`
`My answer was instant.`
`...It wasn't so much that I didn't believe in it as I was on the verge of believing. I wanted to clear away my own doubts. That was the more prominent feeling.`
`"Really?`
` Then that's great.`
` Guess you really are one of those city-raised boys."`
`"So what if I don't believe?`
` I have friends waiting, so could you get to the point?"`
`"The man in this picture is dead."`
`My mind went blank.`
`...Huh? What happened... to Tomitake-san?`
`"It would seem that he died last night.`
` That was the night of the Watanagashi.`
` Do you understand the implications behind that, Maebara-san?"`
`"Implications... not any at..."`
`Not any for the cause of his death or the reasons behind it.`
`...The real problem was that he died on the day of the Watanagashi...`
`Meaning... This year... The curse of Oyashiro-sama had once again...!`
`"The death of Jirou Tomitake is still confidential.`
` You can understand why that is, right?"`
`I didn't want to understand why.`
`"...Please tell me.`
` ...Tell me what happened."`
`"...It was rather peculiar.`
` It might be a little too graphic for someone born and raised in Hinamizawa."`
`It was a roundabout way of saying it, but it caused me to doubt whether or not I wanted to hear the rest.`
`I would only regret forcing myself to learn of something I shouldn't.`
`...Or at least, that's how I figured I would feel if I listened to the rest...`
`"One of our patrol cars discovered the body on the way back from security detail at the festival.`
` It was late. About five till midnight. `
`The location... was, umm... you know where the road into town becomes paved, right?`
` Down past the slope. On the shoulder, around there."`
`There were few street lights on that road.`
`Its pitch-black darkness was only broken by the lights of passing cars and the moon.`
`It was a stroke of luck that Tomitake-san was spotted collapsed on the shoulder of the road.`
`Tomitake-san was face-down, covered in blood.`
` ...Blood and muck covered the asphalt...`
`"We thought it was a hit and run at first.`
`But when the officer checked to see if he was still alive, he quickly noticed something abnormal.`
` ...His throat had been ripped open."`
`"F-From a knife or something...!?"`
`"No.`
` Nails."`
`Nails!?`
` As in fingernails!?`
` You mean... his neck was clawed through...?!`
`"From the coroner's report, it was revealed that it was with his own nails."`
`"Huh? Wha? ...What... does that mean...?"`
`Basically, it means it wasn't a murder... It was suicide.`
`Tomitake-san - whatever was going through his mind - tore open his own throat!`
` As hard as he could with his own nails.`
`...Tore through the skin until he started to bleed...`
` And even then, Tomitake-san didn't stop.`
` He continued clawing!!`
`With enough intensity that it could have peeled off his nails... still clawing!`
` Still clawing!!`
`Then... as his nails reached those vital arteries that you should never damage... he continued clawing!`
` Splurt`
` ...Blood splattered on the ground around him.`
`As he bled...`
` While gasping for breath...`
` He collapsed... his body spasmed... and he died in agony.`
`"We thought drugs were to blame, but nothing of that nature was detected."`
`But this... It was a suicide!?`
`I've never heard of such a thing!!`
`...This unnatural way of dying...!!!`
`If this wasn't a mysterious death, then what was...?`
`The way he died... In these five years, his death most resembled that of a curse...!`
`As if to show both myself and Tomitake-san, who proclaimed there was no such thing as a curse, that we were wrong...!!`
`"There were a few more suspicious details.`
` From his body chemistry, perspiration, epilation, and so on, we concluded that he was in a state of hysteria right before his death."`
`That was a given...`
` It's hard to believe someone could be in a sound state of mind while clawing out their throat...`
`"Wounds on his hands matched a discarded piece of lumber found nearby.`
` ...There are traces of where he struck trees and the guardrails with it.`
` Tomitake-san's blood was found all over the place...`
` ...meaning..."`
`Meaning that while tearing at his own throat, he was swinging around a piece of lumber.`
`"There were external injuries, which were not self-inflicted, discovered on Tomitake-san.`
` ...There is a high probability Tomitake-san was assaulted.`
` The external injuries suggest there may be multiple suspects."`
`To summarize:`
`Tomitake-san was surrounded and attacked.`
`While wandering the night roads in a state of panic, after being cornered, he picked up a piece of lumber and tried fighting back...`
`Somewhere in there, he began madly tearing at his own throat.`
` ...Clawing at it!!`
`Then... he died.`
`"The presumed time of death was between 9pm and 11pm.`
` Meaning... it occurred right after you finished talking to Tomitake-san at the festival."`
`Everyone signed Tomitake-san's shirt... then parted ways...`
` ...Right after that...`
`Oh, yeah... He should have been with a woman.`
` ...What about her!?`
`"She's missing.`
` She hasn't shown up to work and she hasn't returned home, either.`
` ...There is a very high probability that she was involved in this incident."`
`For a while, I could only gaze off into space.`
`I never would have thought that something unfortunate happening to somebody close to me could affect me this deeply...`
`The time I had spent with Tomitake-san was short.`
`...But we went to the same festival, spent time together, and took part in the same competition.`
` ...He was one of us.`
`"We have been continuing the investigation on various fronts, but when it comes to Oyashiro-sama's curse, the villagers here aren't very cooperative..."`
`...That I knew well.`
`...I would have been none the wiser if not for Tomitake-san, the outsider, telling me...`
`"...So that's why you came to me?`
` Because I'm not originally from Hinamizawa?"`
`I should have been angry that that was the reason he wanted to hear what happened from me...`
`"If things go the way they have been... then the conclusion would be that Jirou Tomitake died from Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`He turned away from me and gazed far off into the distance.`
`"...The night of the Watanagashi. During that sacred ritual, he callously snapped off photos, angering Oyashiro-sama... That's how it's going to turn out."`
`"Th-There's no way Oyashiro-sama would inflict divine punishment on Tomitake-san...!"`
`Tomitake-san had to have been killed by humansâ€”and a cowardly group, no less.`
`...There's no way I'm going to let this end up being the fault of some curse!`
`"I think so as well.`
` There's no such thing as divine punishment or curses!!"`
`The tense mood was cut with the man's hearty laugh.`
`"That's how this must be, Maebara-san.`
` ...Cooperation from individuals in Hinamizawa who don't believe in the curse is indispensable.`
` Understand?"`
`Neither Tomitake-san nor I believed in curses.`
`...But with the way things were going, it would just end up with Tomitake-san's death marking the fifth year.`
`Which would mean that Hinamizawa had rejected Tomitake-san.`
` That was something... I couldn't allow.`
`Tomitake-san was one of us.`
`He didn't live in Hinamizawa, but he came every single year... In a sense, he was more of a resident than I was.`
`There was no way that Tomitake-san could have been cursed by Oyashiro-sama...!`
`"But... there is nothing I can do to help.`
` I have no idea what happened that night, either..."`
`"No, no. If you see or hear something that draws your attention, then that is enough."`
`If I see or hear? He was talking in the future tense.`
`"Things or people or rumors.`
` Anything is fine.`
` I don't care if they're unfounded.`
` ...Here, this is my number. If I'm not there, then just leave a message with whoever picks up."`
`He handed me a piece of paper with his number on it, but I hesitated for a second.`
`If I took it... then whether I wanted to or not, I'd be mired knee-deep in this matter.`
`"Please help me solve these questions surrounding Tomitake-san's unfortunate death."`
`That's right.`
` Why was I hesitating?`
`...I needed to find the murderer who killed my friend!`
`I snatched up the piece of paper as a satisfied grin spread across his face.`
`"Everything we spoke of today is a secret.`
` Please keep this confidential."`
`"Understood."`
`"From your friends, as well.`
` Especially from Sonozaki-san and Furude-san; please do not inform them."`
`"Sonozaki? You mean Mion!?`
` Why!? ...Are you saying they have something to do with the incident!?"`
`With my friends' names brought up so abruptly, and being told to keep it a secret from them, I became rather angry.`
`"...Hmm, this is what they call investigative privilege, I suppose."`
`"Don't play games with me!`
` Mion is a close friend of mine!!"`
`I snapped at him, but he didn't seem to especially be offended.`
`"I wouldn't mind telling you`
`...`
` but it may just upset you."`
`"Say it!!"`
`He hesitated a little.`
`Turning his gaze to the outside of the car, he began to speak after thinking for a bit.`
`"There is a possibility that the string of incidents happening here in Hinamizawa are a result of a village conspiracy."`
`"...Th-There's no way that could be right!!"`
`Give me a break!!`
`First of all... is there any proof of that!?`
`"No evidence.`
` Also... each of the cases were resolved, and none of the perpetrators had any direct connection to the village."`
`"Then how did you come to that conclusion!?"`
`"Every year... The enemies of the village die on the day of the Watanagashi.`
` Don't you think that's enough reason to suspect something?"`
`Only the residents of Hinamizawa felt that the day of the Watanagashi was sacred.`
` ...So basically... because incidents happened on that day, it was somehow related to Hinamizawa???`
`"First it was the dam construction foreman!`
` Then it was a villager that supported it!`
` Those the village hold a grudge against die one after the other from mysterious causes. `
`The means are different, but in the end the result is the same."`
`Unfounded, unreasonable suspicion.`
`...But it couldn't just be shrugged off.`
`"So... the victims after that... What about the Shinto priest and his wife's death!?`
` They weren't enemies of the village...!!"`
`"The villagers had expected leadership from the Shinto priest at the time of the dam dispute. But he wasn't proactive, so there was a faction of villagers who harbored ill will towards him as a result."`
`"Ill will? ...It's not like he did anything bad to the village!!`
`What about that housewife after that!?`
` Did she die just because she was the wife of the brother of a supporter!? That's such a trivial reason to kill someone!`
`And what about Tomitake-san!!`
` He's not affiliated with the dam project at all!!! Was he killed just because he was an outsider!?"`
`In the beginning it fell on those related to the dam project, but as the years went on, the "enemy threshold" of the victims had become much lower.`
`"...Well, that's the scary part.`
` The bar keeps getting lower."`
`"What's scary about that...!?"`
`"It means... it's not just enemies of the village anymore. Just being an outsider could be reason enough."`
`"Then... You're saying that next year's victim... will be picked out of the 'village outsider' pool!?"`
`"It might be a person that just moved here."`
`"What do you mean by...?"`
`I swallowed my words.`
`Here in Hinamizawa... the ones who would be considered the most "outside"... would be...`
` ...my family.`
`I was proof enough of that, wasn't I?`
`...I still couldn't really remember the names of the people I passed by...`
`Then... the next victims... my family...`
` ...Was he saying it was going to be me...!?`
`"But... what does that have to do with Mion!?"`
`"I can't go into details, but the Sonozaki family led the dam protests.`
` Quite fervently so.`
`This is also true of Mion Sonozaki-san herself.`
` She has quite a few misdemeanor and obstruction of public worker offenses on her record because of the protests."`
`I knew Mion had 'fought.'`
`...This was the first I'd heard of her family leading the protests though.`
`...Then, well... what did it all mean...?`
`"...Are you saying that... Mion's family is involved with this string of incidents?"`
`"I wouldn't go that far.`
` I'm just saying... that if it was a conspiracy... then they'd have the highest probability of being behind it."`
`Not a very clear explanation.`
`It felt like he'd magnificently avoided the details I really wanted to know.`
`"We don't know who or how involved anyone is right now.`
` ...That is exactly why I don't want you to say anything to the villagers."`
`Instead of answering, I gave a very bitter expression.`
` ...It seemed that he understood it well enough.`
`"Then think of it like this...`
` ...I don't want to worry the villagers who blindly believe it's the curse.`
` ...How about that?"`
`What do you mean "How about that?" How should I know?`
`But the reasoning behind wanting me to not carelessly open my mouth about it wasn't too hard to comprehend.`
`The perpetrator was here.`
`It had nothing to do with a curse.`
`He was definitely going to be caught by the police and made to pay for his crimes.`
`And none of the villagers should have anything to do with that process.`
`It may cause those sensitive about the curse... to just worry needlessly.`
`"...Just like everyone kept it from me so I wouldn't worry about it.`
` ...Is it now my turn to keep it from them so they didn't have to worry?"`
`I was just talking to myself.`
`Unlike me, everyone else had been worrying over these mysterious incidents yearly. And the incident this time probably means a lot more to them...`
`I didn't... I didn't want to burden them anymore...`
`In the end, everything went as the man had wanted, as insipid as it was. But it couldn't be helped...`
`"I understand. I'll keep it to myself.`
` Is that fine? ...Umm... Mr..."`
`"Ooishi, from the Okinomiya Police Station.`
` You can call me Kura-chan if you want."`
`"Ah, no, Ooishi-san is fine..."`
`The way he said it was unpleasant, yet retained hints of politeness. He was the spitting image of a vulgar police officer.`
`...Though, I've never seen one this bulky before in the cop shows I watch...`
`"...I've taken up too much time.`
` Your friends are waiting, aren't they?`
` I should probably let you get back to them."`
`The door opened with a click and in streamed the oppressive heat.`
`It was blistering outside of the car. Was it really this hot of a day...?`
`It was an almost cruel heat, as opposed to the mechanical coolness inside the car.`
`It was as if... the land of Hinamizawa itself suddenly hated me... I felt a little sad as that thought crossed my mind.`
`"I didn't mean to suspect your friends.`
` Please don't misunderstand that."`
`I refrained from telling him that it was too late to say something that self-serving.`
`"It's fine if you don't see or hear anything, Maebara-san.`
` ...It would help to prove that the village is not involved, after all."`
`"I'll contact you if I hear or see anything...`
` but I'm no detective.`
` Please don't expect too much from me."`
`"I won't!`
` You don't have to become a detective.`
` Just go on living as you have up until now.`
` Just let me know if you notice anything."`
`I hastily made my way back to the school building after giving him a quick bow.`
`"See you later. Farewell, Maebara-kun!"`
`I returned to the school building without looking back.`
`I don't know how much time had passed.`
`I did feel bad for keeping them waiting, but right now there was a lot on my mind.`
`...Tomitake-san's death was hard enough as it was... But to think that there was the possibility of a village conspiracy?`
`Worse still... there was also a chance that Mion was involved??`
`Nonsense...`
`Impossible. Not Mion, Rena, Satoko, or Rika-chan.`
`It was a group that attacked Tomitake-san?`
`Who could the perpetrators be?`
`...Could it be... They were hiding here, somewhere in Hinamizawa...?`
`...I didn't know.`
`...All I could say for certain was that I knew that Mion couldn't be the perpetrator.`
`"It's Mii-chan!!`
` The perpetrator!!"`
`Huh?`
` ...I was startled to hear Rena's voice.`
`"With the 'Rope,' in the...`
` hmm...`
` 'Lounge'!!!"`
`"Bwahahaha!!`
` Nooope~~!!"`
`"NooOoOoOOo!!!"`
`Rena clutched her head while flailing about.`
`...Looks like you're just self-destructing over here, wow.`
`"Aaah!!`
` Keiichi-san, you're quite late!!`
` As you may well know, I'm seething with anger!"`
`"A-Ah, sorry about that...`
` I was called into the staff room, you see..."`
`"You were reprimanded for bad behavior?`
` ...That's a shame."`
`"Well, it's been pretty heated over here!`
` Since it's getting pretty late, let's make the next game the last one."`
`"If I remember right... I had zero points...`
` ...Isn't it pretty much decided that I'm going to be finishing in last place?"`
`"D-Don't worry, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...I'm at -1 points.`
` ...Hau~..."`
`The heck!?`
` Her score is lower than mine and I wasn't even playing.`
`"This is the final match to decide if the penalty is going to be carried out by Rena alone or by both Kei-chan and Rena!!"`
`"Yeah, right.`
` Just let Rena do the penalty by herself!"`
`"...We made a promise, Keiichi-kun... That we would both win`
` ...`
` ...I waited all this time, you know? ...You know?"`
`"...Urk... I'm sorry about that..."`
`I followed my initial plan of showing Rena my cards, but I didn't say who was the criminal and just waited for her to call.`
`"I got it!!!`
` The murderer is 'me'!!`
` With the 'Poison,' at the 'Entrance'!!`
` Is it!? Is it!?"`
`"My, my, Rena... Quite a quick answer~?`
` Another stab in the dark?`
` ...Oh."`
`"...Rena's correct."`
`"O~h ho ho ho!!`
` Then it's decided that Keiichi-san shall take part in the penalty as well!!"`
`"Hurraaay!!`
` Keiichi-kun, let's both do our best!â˜†"`
`"Y-Yeah... Let's do our best... hahaha..."`
`It's my fault, so I have no choice...`
`"Then that's game!`
` It's me, Mion Sonozaki, ranked first!`
` In dead last are Keiichi Maebara and Rena Ryuugu!!"`
`Everyone applauded and the game ended.`
`...The problem now... was the penalty...`
`"Now, then. I ranked first, so I'll decide what you'll be buying for the gofer penalty!"`
`"...Wh-What will she make us buy, I wonder... I wonder?"`
`"Let's blacklist the drugstore. That was your aim, wasn't it!?"`
`"Huh?`
` I don't have any business at the drugstore.`
` This old man's already got a list prepared for you on this piece of paper~!"`
`"Whoa... There's a lot written here..."`
`A-A lot!?`
`Damn it, what is she making us buy!?`
`"...Two blocks of tofu.`
` Shampoo and conditioner.`
` Apple vinegar and fried tofu.`
` The heck is this?"`
`"It looks more like... a shopping list than a penalty..."`
`"...Mii was certain she was going to win today."`
`"Rule seven of our society!!!!`
` You cannot refuse any penalty!!!`
` Here's some money. The shampoo I usually get is Fruit Fable.`
` Thanks!"`
`"Th-This is just... your grocery liiisssttt!!!"`
`I promised myself that if I won next time, I'd make her go buy hemorrhoid cream...`
