`Sleepy.`
`"Whoa... That was a really big yawn, Keiichi-kun."`
`I'm usually awake once it's time to eat... But doesn't look like I can do it today...`
`"I was watching TV until late last night... I'm so tired right now..."`
`"H-H-How extremely vile~!!"`
`"...It's perfectly normal for boys. Nothing to be ashamed about."`
`Rika not patting my head only made me feel worse.`
`"Could you just let me... pass out this lunch break?`
` ...No, seriously."`
`"My, you think I would just sit here and allow that?"`
`"I'll get really angry if you disturb me.`
` Really angry!`
` ...Yaawwnn ahh..."`
`This was just dreadful.`
`Just so... sleepy...`
`I slumped my head onto the desk and drifted off into an afternoon nap.`
`It seemed that Satoko had responded, but I pretended not to hear.`
`"...Cut it out, Satoko-chan.`
` Keiichi-kun fell asleep.`
` ...His sleeping face... so kyute.☆"`
`"You can take him home later.`
` Let him be for now."`
`"...Let's move over there.`
` It'd be rude to Keiichi if we bothered him now."`
`...Rika-chan really is a good girl...`
`"Let's not wake him up even if the teacher comes back."`
`I take that back.`
`The excuse that I didn't sleep much last night because I was watching TV was a lie.`
`I was in bed at the usual time, but... because of the conversation with Ooishi-san that afternoon, I didn't get much sleep.`
`Just spending the day like this... It's almost as if the incident with Tomitake-san didn't happen at all.`
`...It made me think... Was Ooishi-san just trying to deceive me?`
`But... it was probably the truth.`
`...One thing was certain, I couldn't speak to anyone about it.`
`He wanted my assistance, but... I really didn't know anything about it.`
`If I knew I wasn't going to be of any help, I probably wouldn't have listened in the first place.`
`It ended up with me, again... regretting learning something I didn't need to know...`
`If I had never learned about it, I would, without a doubt, be goofing off with the rest of them right now.`
`...I couldn't help but resent Ooishi-san for this.`
`"...Huh? ...When was that?"`
`"I heard he wasn't there the next day.`
` ...It appears he vanished the night of the Watanagashi."`
`Mion whispered to keep others from listening, but I could hear it clearly.`
`On the other hand, Rena's voice was even harder to pick up.`
`But I could still tell that she was quite upset.`
`...It couldn't be... Are they talking about Tomitake-san...!?`
`"...nly... itake?"`
`"Not sure.`
` That's all I know."`
`I would have to feign ignorance about this topic because I needed to keep it a secret.`
`Rather than waking up and being forced to lie to join the conversation, it was much easier just to sit here and pretend I was asleep to listen in on their discussion.`
`Wait... why did I have to pretend to be asleep while eavesdropping on my friends' conversation...?`
`The guilt... stung.`
`"...So... and me... there are others, right?`
` ...too."`
`"...but they don't know if it's from the curse or if this was an Onikakushi..."`
`Onikakushi...?`
` Oni-kakushi...?`
` To be hidden away by a demon?`
`What a mysterious phrase.`
`...I did, however, get the feeling it meant nothing good.`
`"...eah... ell... there was another, right?`
` ...right?"`
`"If it's Oyashiro-sama's... yeah."`
`"But, but...!`
` ...This year th... at all...?"`
`"Grandma and the Mayor had talked about it.`
` ...Seems they talked to the police about it beforehand.`
` ...They said they'd take care of whatever happens this year without causing a commotion."`
`"Then... without us knowing it... someone had...`
` ...ed them... you mean...?"`
`"...aybe."`
`"...Next could... me...`
` ...I wonder..."`
`"...Don't worry.`
` You got home safely."`
`"...but... is... not allowed, right...?"`
`"That was a long time ago.`
` Let's stop talking about this."`
`Amidst the uncomfortable mood, both of them went silent.`
`The entirety of the conversation was still a bit unclear, but... a few parts caught my attention.`
`First of all, the term "Onikakushi."`
`...To be 'demoned away.' By the context it was used in, I would guess it's similar to being spirited away.`
`...I suspected that was what it meant because Tomitake-san and that woman (it really bugged me that I don't know her name...) vanished after the Watanagashi.`
`The next thing that stuck out was when Rena said, "There's another one, right?"`
`Mion also said, "If it's Oyashiro-sama's, yeah," responding to something.`
`If it's Oyashiro-sama's curse... then there had to be two victims... is that what she meant...?`
`Come to think of it... I remember Mion saying at the beginning that they didn't know if it was from the curse, or if it was a case of Onikakushi.`
`It seems that the curse and being demoned away are different things, and they were "phenomena" that were paired together...`
`I recalled Tomitake-san's terrible end...`
`That wasn't something as elegant as disappearing.`
` ...That horrendous end would best be described as "cursed."`
`Then... the woman with him... it means she vanished because she was demoned away...?`
`What I do know is... that there's normally an even number of victims of the curse proper.`
`And... the last point that bothered me was Rena.`
`Rena was frightened.`
`...For what reason, I didn't know.`
`However, she knew that something had made her a potential target for Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
`If I recall correctly... Oyashiro-sama should be the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.`
`...Isn't a guardian deity supposed to defend the citizens and drive out invaders...?`
`If I recall correctly, yesterday Ooishi-san said that originally the targets were enemies of the village. But recently, there was no longer any distinction between them or regular outsiders.`
`But if that was the case... then I would think that I'd be the more likely target, having moved here more recently than Rena.`
`From her composure, I could infer that she was grimly certain that... she would be next.`
`...I should probably relay what I heard just now to Ooishi-san.`
`Informing the police of what I heard by eavesdropping on my friends while pretending to be asleep...`
`...It made me feel terrible.`
`It raised a few questions and left me with a bad taste in my mouth...`
`Would it be better not to seek the answers to those questions...?`
`As I continued to learn more and more, I felt like I had fallen past the point of no return...`
`I would definitely regret this one day.`
`...I would definitely regret ever having learned of these events...`
`"The teacher approaches~!!`
` Keiichi-saan!`
` You must awaken!!"`
`In the distance, I could hear the ring of the handbell signaling the start of afternoon classes.`
` ...Geh! I couldn't sleep at all!`
`I hastily opened my eyes and raised my head up.`
`It was in that moment, when I leaned against the back of my seat...`
` "Owwugh!?!?"`
`There was a thumbtack stuck on the back of my chair with tape.`
`...Circumstantial evidence was enough...!`
`"SATOKoOoOOo!!!"`
`Guilty without trial!!`
`Capital punishment!!!!`
`I furiously jumped up from my seat!!`
` ...and I tripped as if my feet were tangled up.`
`My shoelaces had been tied together!`
`"N-Not bad, Satokoooo!!`
` While I was sleeping, you were able to conceal your presence to pull off this fine piece of work!"`
`The teacher came in right as I was about to pull off my shoes and tackle Satoko.`
`"Oh ho ho!!`
` Did you not notice that our teacher has arrived, Keiichi-san?`
` Take your seat~!"`
`*clomp clomp*`
` *whish*`
` *bwif*`
`Not caring one bit, I made her eat a flick to the forehead.`
`"B-Bwaaaaaah!!`
` Keiichi-san is being mean...!!"`
`"Hey!`
` Don't pick on the younger kids, Maebara-kun!`
` Apologize to her!"`
`I saw Satoko stick her tongue out at me... That little braaat!!!`
`"Come on! Maebara-kun!?"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'll apologize.`
` Sorry, Satoko-san."`
`In any case, I apologized, even if it was in a completely insincere tone of voice.`
`...Damn her, I'll remember this!!`
`"Kei-chan, Kei-chan. Get your revenge at the club meeting!`
` Take your seat, take your seat."`
`I sat down after Mion told me to. She'd switched to class representative mode.`
`With the boring classes finished, school was finally over for the day.`
`Now then, what should we do for our club today!?`
`Personally... I would like to play that deduction game one more time.`
`...I was hardly able to play it last time because of Ooishi-san.`
`Rena and I weren't even able to test out our strategy!`
`"That's right. Today, Keiichi-kun and I will be victorious!"`
`"What should we do...?`
` We've never played the same game two days in a row before."`
`"...Why not try asking Mii?"`
`Mion looked over her shoulder as we made eye contact. She slowly tapped her palm with her fist as her face suddenly lit up.`
`"Ooops!`
` I completely forgot, I need to go help my uncle today...!`
` Sorry, guys! Not today!"`
`"Helping your uncle~?`
` Aren't you a little goody-two-shoes!"`
`"Sorry, really...!`
` I really did forget... Well, then... sorry, guys!`
` This old man is heading back home now!"`
`Mion left us with that and rushed off to the exit after snatching up her bag.`
`"You see, Mii-chan... She sometimes goes to help out at her uncle's shop in town."`
`Ahh... I thought she wasn't the type to get caught up in such bothersome stuff.`
`"She said that she gets paid for it.`
` It's quite a bit of spending money, from what I hear."`
`I see.`
` She was able to pay for that mountain of games with what she saved up from there.`
`"But that... wouldn't you call that a part-time job?`
` Isn't that against school policy!?"`
`Is that what she's calling it...?`
`...So what now?`
` Pass on the club today?`
`"...So... we're done today, I guess? ...I guess?"`
`"Won't it be fine even without the club president?`
` ...Let's do this!"`
`I opened the club locker and began searching for the deduction game from that ever-growing pile of games.`
`"Ah, here it is!`
` The deduction game from yesterday!`
` Man, I had to stop just as I was getting the hang of it."`
`At the very least, I wanted to repay Satoko for what she did during the afternoon break!!`
`"I do not mind.`
` But is that fine for Rena-san and Rika?"`
`"Umm`
` ...If Keiichi-kun wants to so badly, I wouldn't mind playing for a bit."`
`"...I think... it's better if we do it when we have everyone together."`
`Mmm... When she says it like that... hmmmm.`
`"I wanted to go shopping if there wasn't a club meeting today.`
` ...Going to buy soy sauce and other things."`
`"Oh! ...That's right!`
` I completely forgot."`
`"Well... I guess since it's been a while, I should go treasure hunting...!"`
`What's this, now? ...Everyone was no longer in the mood for club activities.`
`If I kept on trying to push the matter, it may make them realize I had a trick up my sleeve...`
`...Ah, well. I'll give up this time.`
`"Man, I really was looking forward to playing it..."`
`I shuffled through the cards as if I was still caught up on it.`
`"At the next opportunity, I shall give you a sound thrashing!`
` Oh ho ho!!"`
`"The murderer is 'Satoko'!`
` The murder weapon is the 'Pistol'!`
` It was you after all!!"`
`"Wh-What did you say!?`
` Then I'll just...!!"`
`Satoko looked through the cards on the desk and stuck out three of them at me.`
`"The murderer is 'Keiichi'!`
` In the 'Lounge' with the 'Rope'!!"`
`"I don't need no rope!`
` I'll just strangle you like this!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` Keiichi-san is such a beast!!!!"`
`Phew.`
` ...Well, I guess it's good that I got that out of my system.`
`"Bwaaaaah!!`
` I'll remember this, Keiichi-san!!"`
`"Ahahaha☆ ...Kyute, kyute...☆"`
`Everyone got ready to go back home.`
`I also helped gather up the scattered cards.`
`I suddenly paused.`
` ...They were just the suspect cards... but I noticed something strange.`
`"Rena"`
` "Satoko"`
` "Rika"`
` "Keiichi"`
` "Mion"`
` ...`
` "Satoshi"`
`Satoshi?`
`...Not all the cards were made by us.`
`Or at least, every card besides this one has the name of a club member.`
`...Does this mean that this Satoshi fellow... is a member?`
`Was there someone in the class named Satoshi...?`
`I couldn't find anyone named Satoshi on the class roster stuck up on the wall.`
`"Keiichi-kun! Let's hurry and finish cleaning up!"`
`Being rushed by Rena, I finished up quickly.`
`Satoko and Rika-chan had already headed merrily for their lockers, so we were the only ones left in the classroom.`
`Right now, Rena had already gotten her bag and was ready to leave.`
`"Rena.`
` There must be quite a few people who transfer from this school... right?"`
`I tried asking Rena in a bit of a roundabout way.`
`Rena made a troubled face and then answered.`
`"...Yeah.`
` Hinamizawa is a rural town, right?`
` Some people transfer out every now and then."`
`"Then is Satoshi another one of those transferees?"`
`"Sorry!`
` ...`
`I don't really know."`
`There was a bit of a pause, but the answer was pretty much immediate.`
`"Ah, um... I'm not saying it to be mean!`
` ...Just last year...`
` I transferred in... so maybe I just missed him.`
` So I didn't hear much about him.`
` ...Sorry!"`
`I am not sure, sorry.`
`Her answer was a lot like when she refused to tell me about the murder at the dam.`
`I was saddened by her denial... and felt a little bit of anger.`
`I'm... their friend, aren't I?`
`Friends... don't keep secrets from their friends, do they?`
`Though I do appreciate that they kept that unsettling curse thing from me.`
`...But... if everyone is worried about it, I'd rather be worried with them.`
`...That's... That's what it means to be friends, right...?`
`For a moment, I wondered just what kind of face I was making just then... with these mixed feelings of sadness and annoyance...`
`"K... Keiichi-kun... you're making a scary face.`
` ...Why is it? ...Why?"`
`It was probably exactly the kind of face Rena said it was.`
`...It appeared my grim expression had frightened her.`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` ...I was really looking forward to the club today, I'm just feeling down about it."`
`I rustled Rena's hair.`
`"Let's go home."`
`Dragging that awkward mood with us, we headed home.`
`I wonder why.`
`...Why have I been getting this dumb feeling lately...?`
`I didn't know anything... I had nothing to worry about... I was just enjoying my everyday life.`
`My long, outstretched shadow gave no answer to my naive inquiry.`
`"...Keiichi-kun, are you tired, maybe...?`
` ...Maybe?"`
`Rena timidly questioned the reason behind my mood.`
`...I'm sure my expression made this situation even more unsettling.`
`"...You think so?"`
`"Y-Yeah.`
` ...You seemed to have been a little out of it ever since this morning.`
` Maybe... a cold?"`
`Physically, I was pretty sure I was in perfect health.`
` It may not seem like it, but I've had perfect attendance since elementary school.`
`Rena continued on since I didn't give her an answer.`
`"It could be that the fatigue from moving has finally caught up to you.`
` ...It's completely different from where you used to live, after all. `
`Of course you've gotten tired... since there's so much you need to get used to and remember."`
`"Maybe that's it."`
`"Yeah.`
` It has to be.`
` Rena was also like that at first, too.`
` I can tell, you know?`
` ...You know?"`
`...I wondered if Rena also experienced the slight bit of alienation last year that I was feeling right now.`
`...Thinking so, I felt that she was the only one who could understand how I felt.`
`"I'd like to hear about when you first came to Hinamizawa.`
` ...How was it?"`
`Feeling I had been drawn into the conversation, her face suddenly brightened.`
`"Ahahaha.`
` It was the same as Keiichi-kun.`
` I didn't know the villagers' names at all.`
` Mii-chan and the rest were all very kind so I wasn't lonely, but I did still feel a little out of place."`
`Rena told me all the details of when she had moved here.`
`All of her first acquaintances and surprises. Worries and good times.`
`"So... Satoko got you, too!?"`
`"Yeah.`
` There was a thumb tack put on my chair.`
` Poke.`
` ...Then with that, I...`
` ...`
`Yeah.`
` That really takes me back!"`
`"When were you invited into the club?`
` The first day?"`
`"Nah.`
` ...There wasn't a club at the beginning.`
` It was formed partway through.`
` ...One day, she said we should stay after and hold a big game tournament."`
`"Come to think of it... Mion did say she was the first club president.`
` Now I get it."`
`"This is a secret, but Mii-chan used to be really bad at the beginning.`
` She'd never win."`
`"Huh!?`
` Mion, really!?`
` ...I can't even imagine that!"`
`"She had to do most of the penalties that she came up with.`
` Ahaha!`
` Seriously, don't tell!"`
`I can't believe Mion was like that...!`
`...So she gradually transformed into a monster who used any means necessary to win during that time.`
`Mion is at her best when she's fighting dirty!`
`"I began making more friends besides Mii-chan after that... but, yeah.`
` It might have only been since you moved here.`
` That I had finally felt like I had gotten used to it here."`
`I guess Rena... had also been left in the dark about Oyashiro-sama when she had just moved here.`
`...I guess when they finally told me about Oyashiro-sama, I'd be considered one of them.`
`"I wonder when I'll finally be considered one of them."`
`"Huh?`
` Did you say something?"`
`"...No, sorry.`
` Just talking to myself."`
`"Ahahaha. Keiichi-kun, you're silly."`
`Rena was poking fun and laughing at me, and I couldn't help but laugh as well...`
`But I suddenly stopped.`
`Then... after making up my mind, I spoke.`
`"Hey, Rena.`
` ...Is there something... that everybody is keeping from me...?"`
`"Huh.`
` ...No.`
` Not at all."`
`"You're lying, aren't you...?"`
`Rena suddenly stopped.`
`Her expression was cold and intense.`
`"What do you mean by that,`
` Keiichi-kun?"`
`Her tone was still the same cheery and lighthearted one as before.`
`"You are, aren't you...?`
` ...Keeping something from me?"`
`After understanding what I meant, her expression grew even more intense.`
`...Seeing that face, I regretted saying something so rash.`
`...But she came back at me in a way I didn't expect.`
`"Well then, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Aren't you keeping something from us?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`Her tone didn't change... but it was the first time I'd seen this expression from Rena.`
`With how her gaze pierced through me, I couldn't believe this was the same Rena.`
`"Aren't you?`
` Lies or secrets...`
` ...Aren't you?"`
`You are.`
` Secrets...`
`...She didn't actually say that part... but she looked as if she did.`
`The incident with Tomitake-san... and how I felt alienated from the group.`
`...Even without having to think about it... there were things I knew that I felt guilty about...`
`But... I didn't tell everyone about what happened with Tomitake-san... to be considerate.`
`...I was keeping it a secret just the same way they didn't tell me about Oyashiro-sama...`
`Then... aren't we even...!?`
`"...No, I'm not.`
` ...No lies.`
` Nor secrets."`
`"Liar."`
`Her answer was instant and it shook me.`
`Rena stared as if burrowing through me.`
`Watching me... like a hawk.`
`"...Why would you say I'm lying...?"`
`"Didn't you say that you were called into the teacher's room yesterday during the club meeting, Keiichi-kun!?`
` I know...`
` You didn't go to the teacher's room."`
`I swallowed hard...`
`It clearly wasn't a bluff... she knew what happened.`
`"The teacher said you had a guest, didn't she?`
` But you didn't talk at the entrance.`
` You talked inside of the car near the school gate.`
` With some man we don't know!"`
`Rena... knew everything...`
`She knew that I was called out by Ooishi-san and that I heard about the incident with Tomitake-san as well... Did she know all of it!?`
`"Exactly who was that man?"`
`"I-I don't know him...!"`
`"Why did someone you don't know have business with you?"`
`"I... I want to know that, myself!"`
`"Then what did you talk about!?"`
`"It has nothing to do with you guys...!"`
`It was a lie.`
`Rena's scream echoed through the trees...`
`Sending frightened birds into the air.`
`I couldn't exhale the deep breath I had just taken.`
` No. It was like I wasn't allowed to exhale.`
`It was here... I first realized...`
`...The person in front of me... She wasn't Rena Ryuugu.`
`...Then... Who was it that was standing before me now?`
`...Who had assumed Rena Ryuugu's appearance!?`
`I had held my breath for so long, I could feel myself suffocating...`
`"Right?"`
`And then she made a facial expression that Rena normally might have made.`
`...It didn't matter that it was Rena's usual smile... It chilled me to the bone.`
`She drew closer to me.`
`I felt her breath against my face.`
`...It wasn't the least bit exciting.`
`Whoever this was with Rena's face was going to chew my nose right off...!!`
`...I cowered as I imagined that.`
`Then... she smirked as if she was able to see right through me.`
`"We also have secrets... just like how Keiichi-kun has secrets!"`
`It was Rena's usual smile...`
`...But her eyes were still like that of a hawk's.`
`...Bringing her face close enough to mine to almost bump into my nose... She 'kindly' persuaded me.`
`I couldn't nod or shake my head.`
`This person standing in front of me... this person who looked like Rena, frightened me to my core.`
`I was terrified knowing that she could hear the sound of me swallowing nervously.`
`After what felt like an eternity, after a long empty silence, she finally spoke...`
`"Let's go.`
` ...It's getting chilly."`
`It was Rena again.`
`Smiling at me once more, she started walking as if nothing at all had happened.`
`...When I was released from her gaze... My legs gave out from under me and I slumped onto the ground...`
`...I wasn't able to lift a finger until Rena was out of sight.`
`"...Who was... that...?"`
`...I felt cold. My body was drenched in sweat.`
`I was finally able to form a coherent thought and asked myself once again.`
`Who was... that person...`
` ...who looked like Rena Ryuugu!?`
`I was out of it and couldn't bring myself to do anything until dinner except stare blankly into space.`
`Was I terrified from Rena going off on me?`
`...No, that's not right.`
`That was someone else who only looked like Rena.`
`Then... who could it have been?`
`It was a dreadful feeling...`
`...Knowing that that was someone else, not Rena. So tomorrow I shouldn't have a problem talking to Rena like I usually do.`
`That thought was strangely comforting.`
`I concluded that I should just calm down and clear my head.`
`...Though those thoughts continued swirling around my mind.`
`Finally, I returned to my senses as I heard my mother calling out to me from the bottom of the stairs.`
`"Keiichi~!`
` It's a call from the bookstore~."`
`Bookstore?`
` Can't think of why they'd be calling me.`
`...I went downstairs and picked up the receiver anyway.`
`"My apologies for calling so late at night.`
` It's me, Ooishi of the Okinomiya bookshop."`
`"Ooishi-san?`
` ...Oh, it's Ooishi-san!"`
`"Sorry.`
` Since your parents picked up I said I was from the bookstore.`
`It puts people off when I say I'm a police officer."`
`Ooishi-san was, in his own way, rather courteous.`
`Even so, I didn't want my parents hearing me talk to the police.`
`...I brought the cordless phone with me as I dashed back up to my room on the second floor.`
`"Sorry for calling so late.`
` That phone number on the piece of paper I gave you yesterday was the old number.`
` My apologies.`
` Can you copy down the number I'm about to give you?"`
`"Ah, yeah.`
` ...Uum... okay."`
`He gave me the number for his direct line as I wrote it down.`
`I thought that was the end of it, but he began making pointless small talk, and it was pretty hard to hang up.`
`"So how has it been, Maebara-san?`
` Did anything strange happen recently?"`
`...I see.`
` This was the real reason.`
`He really beat around the bush there. His adult conversational skills left me slack-jawed.`
`"Are you... from around here, Ooishi-san?"`
`"Yeah, I am.`
` Born and raised in Okinomiya."`
`If he's from around here... he might know.`
`"Um, Ooishi-san.`
` ...Do you know what this 'Onikakushi' thing is about?'"`
`"Hm... I believe... that's when somebody suddenly vanishes because they've been abducted by a demon.`
` It's a special saying from around here.`
` It has the same meaning as 'spirited away' like everyone else says."`
`Whereas my friends would say they didn't know when I asked... this older man gave me a direct answer.`
`...It made me a bit happy that he answered me directly without trying to hide anything.`
`"Hinamizawa was... um, not sure if I should tell you this, Maebara-san."`
`"Don't try to play this off.`
` If you're not going to talk, then I'm not going to tell you anything!"`
`"Ah, no no!`
` That's not what I meant.  It's just... it may make you feel bad.`
` ...You see... long ago, Hinamizawa was feared as the village where demons reside."`
`"Demons?`
` By demons you mean... those pitchfork-carrying things in Hell?"`
`"Hmm~ more like human-eating monsters.`
` They'd go down to villages snatching people up and gobbling them down. That kind of tale."`
`Demons snatching up people is what this "Onikakushi" really means.`
`"...They said that the curse and being demoned away happen together.`
` ...What does that mean?"`
`I already knew about the mysterious deaths happening five years in a row.`
`...But I didn't know there were people disappearing for those same five years.`
`"The curse and being demoned away happen together?`
` First time I've heard of that.`
` Is that how it is, Maebara-san?"`
`"That's what I want to know.`
` ...I heard Rena and Mion talking. They said that if it was really Oyashiro-sama's curse, then both the curse and demoning away would happen."`
`Ooishi-san began hemming and hawing on the other end of the receiver.`
`...Maybe something about that came to mind?`
`"Maebara-san.`
` Do you know the first incident?`
` The murder by dismemberment."`
`"Yeah.`
` One of the six perpetrators is still on the run, right?"`
`"Hypothetically...`
` What if he isn't on the run, but was demoned away?"`
`Huh!?`
` ...It was an outrageous hypothesis from Ooishi-san.`
`The incident four years ago was the particularly ghastly one.`
`The police already knew the perpetrators.`
`So they posted tons of wanted posters with his face on them.`
`They staked out various locations and investigated every possible escape route he had.`
`But... after four years, there wasn't even a hint of where he might be.`
` ...Unless the police were completely incompetent.`
`Even if it was an outrageous hypothesis, I couldn't simply laugh it off...`
`"Then what about the incident the next year?`
` When the man who supported the project and his wife both died in an accident?"`
`"Well, actually.`
` ...It was only the husband who died in an accident.`
` His wife's body never surfaced.`
` ...Unless we find the body, then it's considered a missing person by law."`
`At the time of the incident, with the river below the cliff being muddy rapids...`
`The police divers had searched every branch off the main stream of the river for dozens of miles. But in the end, they weren't able to find her body.`
`"But... That's just them not being able to find the body. She's still dead, right?`
` Isn't it different from her being demoned away...?"`
`"We cannot say someone is dead without their body.`
` Until a certain number of years pass, by law she's treated as still alive."`
`I'm not sure if it was right to call that being demoned away...`
`The wife is missing.`
`At least that part was reality.`
`"How about the 3rd year?`
` The Shinto priest died of illness.`
` And his wife committed suicide...?"`
`"Maebara-san.`
` That's actually the exact same scenario."`
`The wife had supposedly thrown herself into the bottomless swamp deep in the forest around Hinamizawa.`
`...Meaning it's all circumstantial evidence.`
`They simply found her suicide note in front of the swamp...`
`...A diver was able to recover a few of her articles, but they weren't able to find a body.`
`The investigative headquarters believed that she had faked her death and was still alive somewhere.`
`"I'm not sure if we could refer these cases as being demoned away.`
` It's just as you've said. Every year, one person does go missing."`
`"The incident this year... The woman with Tomitake-san has gone missing...`
` Then what about the incident with the housewife beaten to death?`
` Who went missing?`
` ...I believe the perpetrator was caught, right?"`
`"Yeah, we arrested him.`
` He admitted to the crime while being questioned about a different incident.`
` But... well, you see... `
`After he was arrested... a child from the victim's home went missing.`
` It's still under investigation...`
` As to whether the disappearance had anything to do with the crime."`
`"But you said you caught him, right?`
` Did he have an accomplice!?"`
`"No idea... It was most likely only the one perpetrator.`
` Moreover, we can't even check now.`
` ...Because while under investigation, that man... he died in his holding cell."`
`He swallowed a spork and choked to death.`
`It's not known whether it was an accident or suicide.`
`"Meaning... for the last five years there's always one person who dies and one who goes missing...?"`
`"That's about right.`
` No, actually, I'm surprised as well.`
` I never realized they had that in common."`
`I couldn't believe that this could help lead to the closing of those incidents.`
`...It was just something they had in common.`
`"...Could it be... that those demoned away... have something in common?"`
`Ooishi-san mumbled as he seemed to be thinking about it.`
`So I summarized the events.`
`"The first year was the dam employee.`
` Second year was the wife of a dam project supporter.`
` Third year was the wife of the Shinto priest. `
`Fourth year was the victim's family's child, and the fifth year was the victim's girlfriend... I guess.`
` ...It doesn't seem like there's anything that connects them."`
`"With the exception of the first year... wives and girlfriends... those do stand out."`
`...It does seem like there are a lot.`
`Then that means... The fourth year's victim's child was different.`
`It would have really stood out if it were all married couples... except it's not just married couples, but parents and children as well.`
`...Come to think of it... I believe Tomitake-san also told me "The younger brother is alive and has moved," if I recall correctly.`
`"The child that went missing in the fourth year... who were they?"`
`"Apparently, he was quite mature.`
` One year older than you.`
` His name was Satoshi Houjou-san."`
`"...Huh? Satoshi...!?!?"`
`I remembered that name.`
`...Didn't they tell me Satoshi transferred out last year...!?`
`"He was at your school up until last year.`
` Didn't they tell you anything about him?"`
`Come to think of it... when I transferred in, I believe they said my seat "belonged to a recent transfer student..."?`
`Then... where I sat...`
` ...`
`Once belonged to the one who was demoned away.`
` ...`
`It was his seat!?`
`I recalled the cold sensation that came from that desk... it made my hair stand on end...`
`This string of mysterious deaths...`
` No, Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` I now knew how it connected to me.`
`That chilling sensation... it was the feeling of Oyashiro-sama caressing the back of my neck.`
`"...Oyashiro-sama's curse... huh?"`
`...Could Oyashiro-sama's curse... really exist?`
`In all honesty...`
`...I was beginning to believe it.`
`...And I was scared.`
`...That was why I wanted to say it was a plot crafted by man and not the work of a curse.`
`But... the more I dug into it, the less likely that seemed.`
`No... the more I dug, the more mysterious it became.`
`...If I kept digging... eventually...`
` ...I'd reach the point where I'd learn something I really shouldn't know...`
`To either be none the wiser or to seek an answer I may regret...`
` ...Which one would I be happier with?`
`Maybe... it'll be me next time.`
`...My execution could only be delayed for one year.`
`...That was when I remembered...`
` Rena...`
`Rena said she may be the next victim of the curse.`
`"...You mean Rena Ryuugu-san?`
` She transferred in last year and she's your classmate, isn't she?`
` ...These incidents really might be a bit too disturbing for a girl.`
` She's not just scared, is she?"`
`It wasn't that.`
`She said it might be her next.`
`She said it in a way that made me think she had a concrete reason behind it.`
`"...It felt like she was convinced.`
` ...Almost as if... um, you could say..."`
`She was frightened.`
`Her sudden change in demeanor.`
`That someone who looked like Rena, but wasn't Rena...`
`...That might be unrelated.`
`All the strange things that I felt from Rena today came back to me.`
`"I see...`
` Then I'll be doing a bit of investigating on this end.`
` Please continue your observations of Ryuugu-san, Maebara-san."`
`"...Are you... asking me to keep Rena under surveillance?"`
`"That's not what I mean, Maebara-san.`
` I just want you to watch out for your friend so she doesn't end up the next victim."`
`At that moment, just as my mouth was agape because I was so impressed with his mature, clever way with words...`
`Knock knock!`
`A sudden knock at the door sent my heart racing.`
`In an instant, I had pointlessly covered up the end of the receiver.`
`"Keiichi~ Get the door, please~."`
`On the other side of the door, I heard my father's oddly upbeat voice.`
` ...What could it be?`
`It's so late...`
`"Sorry, my dad just came in.`
` ...Can we leave it at this for tonight?"`
`"Yeah.`
` My apologies again for calling so late.`
` ...If you find out anything else, please let me know.`
` I'll tell you if I make any progress on this end.`
` Well then, have a pleasant evening."`
`"Keiichi~ hurry and open up~`
` Daddy's got his hands full."`
`What is Dad doing...?`
`I had stayed in the same position while on the phone the whole time, so my joints were aching.`
`When I opened the door, I saw my father was standing there with a tray.`
`On that tray, cookies and two cups of black tea. A fairly fancy spread for our household.`
`There was even sugar and lemon slices on the side. Everything you could ask for.`
`...This was quite the show of hospitality.`
`"Wh-What's going on, Dad?`
` ...What's all this for??"`
`"Come, now. Don't play around, Keiichi~`
` I'm coming in~."`
`Dad was in high spirits and had a smirk on his face.`
`But... for my entire life, I've never seen him act this hospitable.`
`...What had gotten into him?`
`"So... what were you talking about?"`
`I jumped.`
`...It's not something I had to keep from my father...`
` But how could I explain to him I was talking to a detective (I'm assuming he was) this late at night?`
`"N-N-Nothing much...`
` Just a friend...!"`
`"I don't mean the phone.`
` She was here, wasn't she?`
` Rena-chan."`
`?`
`"...She wasn't here."`
`"Come now! Don't try to keep it from me~!`
` She just came over to play.`
` You two were chatting away, so I thought I'd bring some tea, but looks like I just missed her."`
`I had no idea what Dad was talking about.`
`...But a cold sweat dripped down my back.`
`"H... How long were we talking...?"`
`"Rena-chan went upstairs about half after... so it was close to an hour, I guess?"`
`"You saw her... come up to the second floor?"`
`"Yeah, I did.`
` I also told her that your room was the door down the hall up the stairs."`
`Rena came to my house about an hour ago.`
` ...Dad met her at the door... and called out to me on the second floor.`
`(I probably didn't hear him because I was so focused on my conversation with Ooishi-san...)`
`I didn't reply, but he knew I was in my room, so he had her come inside.`
`...Then told her my room was on the second floor.`
`...She thanked my dad and went upstairs...`
`Then about an hour passed.`
`...She passed by my dad just as he was bringing up tea and left.`
`She came upstairs and about an hour passed.`
`Then passed by my dad and returned home.`
`Th... Then... after she came upstairs... and until she left... where was... Rena...?`
`There's only a short hallway... between my room and the stairs.`
`Meaning...`
` Rena had...`
` For about an hour...`
` ..In the hall...`
` ...No... she couldn't have been standing in front of my door all that time...`
`The door to my room wasn't particularly thick.`
`You could easily hear everything being said inside.`
`...All of the unsettling and unguarded things I spoke to Ooishi-san about began rushing through my head...`
`"Honey, don't tease him.`
` ...More importantly, you need to clean up your studio.`
` It's a mess again."`
`Mom yelled up at Dad from downstairs.`
`Dad left the tray with me and went downstairs with a disappointed chortle.`
`I followed my dad out of the room with my eyes... I looked down at the floor around the doorway where Rena might have stood all that time.`
`Just now... as I was talking to Ooishi-san... With my back turned, Rena was standing a mere six feet away... the whole time...?`
`All that time... in this dimly lit doorway...?`
`What did she see?`
`What did she hear?`
`For what reason?`
`As the steam from the two teacups ominously wafted and twisted... the aroma of black tea filled my room...`
