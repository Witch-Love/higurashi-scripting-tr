` Are you a regular user of dating chatlines or something?"`
`"I would never even try something seedy like that...!"`
`"The way you overreact is rather... interesting.`
` Na ha ha ha!`
` Wanna go to a place where you can have a little bit of lewd fun?`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
` Too bad, we'll leave that for next time, then.`
`"...I know asking this now might be stupid... but we're betting money on this, aren't we...?"`
`"Well~ you see, just a little.`
` It's just a little for funsies.`
` But it doesn't matter who loses, because after this, we're using that money to go play at a very ni~ce place~~!`
` Mfu fu fu fu fu~~!!!"`
`"...Ooishi-san took all my money the other day, and I also have work to do, so I can't stay for long..."`
` If you win, then you can use that money to pay for this table, and you can talk to Kuraudo about work or whatever."`
`"...I understand.`
` Then, I'll play with you guys for just a bit.`
` If I win, you guys don't get any of the money or get to go to any of those dirty places, and we talk about work right away."`
` Of course, we're going to hop between all the places where they keep the girls coming! `
`"Like a nice quiet place where you can play footsies with a bunny girl?`
`"The owner ended up charging what he called a 'tailoring fee.'"`
`"I played quite a bit around Waseda and Takadanobaba.`
` I raised the stakes a little too much at the place I frequented and they banned me. `
`"It depends on who I was playing with, but there were pretty high stakes when I played in Kabukicho.`
` The largest I played with were about 20 times the standard rate."`
` Kuraudo!!`
` You buffoon!!`
` Where did you pull this guy from? He's strong enough to play for the Yakuza!!`
