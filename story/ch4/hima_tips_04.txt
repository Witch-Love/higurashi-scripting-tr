`The car had stopped.`
`But he didn't know any more than that.`
`For not only was he blindfolded, but locked in the trunk of the car.`
`How could people become this powerless just by being robbed of their sight?`
` He absolutely wouldn't have known this without experiencing it firsthand.`
`He soon realized it was pointless to try and undo his bonds, with the confines of the trunk quickly making him lightheaded.`
` He had no choice but to let this mild torture dull his senses.`
`That's why, when the car stopped and the unpleasant vibration ceased as the engine was killed,`
` he couldn't help but delude himself that he was being set free, even though nothing had been resolved in reality.`
`Of course, he was soon removed from that delusion.`
`He strained his ears when he heard one of the men who had abducted him and an older man he was hearing for the first time strike up a conversation...`
`"...Nice to see you.`
` The chick is in the trunk.`
` He struggled so much that he's probably exhausted right now, but there's not a mark on him, just as ordered."`
`"...Ohh, musta been a handful."`
`The trunk opened, letting in a blast of fresh, cool air.`
`Even though up until just now he had been thinking about getting out of that stuffy trunk, when it was actually opened, he suddenly became uneasy.`
`...Enough so that he wished that the lid of the trunk would once again close, separating himself from them.`
`Suddenly, somebody stroked his head.`
`Of course, since he was blindfolded, he couldn't tell if the hand was petting him or simply evaluating how easy it would be to remove his scalp. `
`Unable to tell the difference, he could only freeze as he imagined the worst-case scenario...`
`"...Poor li'l bugger...`
` 'E's shakin'...`
` Jus' stay calm for a bit..."`
`The older man said that kindly as he gently stroked the boy's head.`
`"This mus' be real tough for ya...`
` But ya see, yer gramps is a nice man.`
` 'E'll 'elp ya soon enough..."`
`Having heard nothing but the average standard dialect his whole life, the older man's distinct intonation left a deep impression on the boy.`
`But he had no idea what he was saying.`
`For 'yer gramps' to register as meaning 'your grandfather' took a while to process...`
`Eventually, the hand that was stroking his head loosened the blindfold.`
`"...Can't keep his eyes covered...`
` if he splits his face open it'd be bad."`
`"Hm... An' with tha'...`
` We migh' as well take out tha gag.`
` 'E kent breathe like tha'..."`
`"...It'll be trouble if he yells...`
` Leave him to us..."`
`"...Geez, ya guys dunno how ta treat somebody!!`
` ...Tha main family said no rough stuff.`
` Ya better remember tha' well..."`
`"Yeah.`
` We won't do anything stupid.`
` ...As long as the kid cooperates, that is."`
`The man's hand prodded roughly and repeatedly at the boy's head.`
`A rugged hand, unlike the affectionate one that had been stroking his head before.`
`Just stay cooperative.`
`If you struggle, there's no guarantee what will happen.`
` That cliched threat was literally beaten into his head.`
