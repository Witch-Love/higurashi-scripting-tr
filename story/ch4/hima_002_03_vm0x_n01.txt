` You could quit the force and easily make a living in sales for some large corporation."`
`"I've never so much as considered quitting the force...!"`
`"The way you overreact is rather... interesting.`
` Na ha ha ha!`
` That's no good, it doesn't pay to be a cop and it's not too late to reconsider.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
` Too bad, we'll leave the retirement conversation for next time, then.`
`"...I know asking this now might be stupid... but we're all police, aren't we...?"`
`"Well~, let's not talk about that.`
` Loosen up a bit, we won't actually gamble anything.`
` We're just deciding who's going to pay for everyone to go play at a very ni~ce place afterward~~!`
` Mfu fu fu fu fu~~!!!"`
`"...Ooishi-san took all my money the other day, and I also have work to do, so I can't stay for long..."`
` If you win, then you won't have to pay for this table, and you can talk to Kuraudo about work or whatever."`
`"...I understand.`
` Then, I'll play with you guys for just a bit.`
` If I win, you guys don't get to go out playing, and we talk about work right away."`
` Of course, we're going to hop between all the favorite places! `
`"Like a nice quiet place with a bunny girl?`
`"The owner started a bottle of Dom Perignon on my tab and called it a 'tailoring fee.'"`
`"I played quite a bit around Waseda and Takadanobaba.`
` The place I frequented banned me for winning too much. `
`"It depends on who I was playing with, but I had an almost perfect record playing in Kabukicho.`
` Especially since when I played against a certain crowd, my life was on the line."`
` Kuraudo!!`
` You buffoon!!`
` Where did you pull this guy from? He's practically a professional!!`
