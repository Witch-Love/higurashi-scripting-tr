`"Dammit!!`
` Wait, just wait!!`
` I don't want to die!!!"`
`"Aah, and I don' wanna kill ya!!`
` 'Slong as ya unnerstand!!"`
`"Don't shoot, okay!?`
` Don't shoot!!`
` I have a wife waiting for me at home!!`
` I don't want to die!!!"`
`"I won' shoot 'slong as ya don' yell or nuthin' !`
` Jes quietly put yer 'ands on yer 'ead and lie down!!"`
`"Will you really!?`
` Will you really!?!?`
` You'll keep your promise, right!?`
` This is a promise between men!!"`
`"I will!!`
` 'S a promise between men!!"`
`"Keep your promise! Keep it!!!`
` I'm going to get down on the ground, okay?`
` I'm getting down!`
` I'll keep my promise, so stop pointing that gun at me!!`
` You're still thinking of shooting me, aren't you!? `
`You want to shoot me, don't you!?`
` When I get down on the ground, you're just going to shoot me in the back of the head, aren't you!?!?"`
`"I won', I won'!!`
` Fine!!`
` I'll put it away!`
` I'll put tha gun away!!`
` 'S a promise between men!!`
` ...There!!`
` No problem now, righ'!?!?"`
`"Yeah, absolutely no complaints!!!"`
`"Gah!`
` Ugghhhaaa!!!"`
`It was over in a flash.`
`The moment he lowered his gun, Ooishi didn't let his chance slip by!`
`Ooishi had been assessing the situation for quite some time from behind the two men.`
`But since they had their guns trained on me, he didn't really have a chance to jump in.`
`Seeing the look on Ooishi's face indicating that he wanted me to create an opening, I took on that role completely.`
`Ooishi forcefully lifted the arm that was holding the gun.`
`He then took the gun from the man's hand in only an instant!`
`The other man, who was a bit slow in grasping what was happening, pointed his gun at them, but with his ally grappling with Ooishi, he couldn't pull the trigger.`
`If that man was the one that was wrestling with Ooishi at the moment, he might have shot without hesitation.`
`But this man wouldn't shoot.`
` He couldn't shoot!!`
`Ooishi kicked the other man away, and while aiming the stolen gun with his left hand, pulled out his own.`
`With guns akimbo, he was aiming at both men at the same time!`
`"I do believe that's checkmate!!"`
`It was perfectly played.`
`But, heedless of the guns pointed at them, the men shouted "Scram!!" as they scattered away at full speed.`
`It was over in an instant.`
`Those two running away without putting up a fight was honestly unexpected.`
`Ooishi, quietly clicking his tongue in admonishment, slipped both guns into his pants pockets.`
`"Tsk.`
` Those guys know their stuff..."`
`"...?`
` What do you mean?"`
`"An officer won't fire at somebody who's fleeing.`
` I want to keep my pension here."`
`Ooishi and I grinned at each other.`
`"Are you Toshiki Inukai-kun?`
` The grandson of the Minister of Construction, Inukai?"`
`"Y... Yes...!"`
`"...This is going to be a major incident.`
` We probably only cut the tail off the lizard though.`
` Nfu fu fu."`
`Ooishi smiled amusedly.`
`The fact that the Onigafuchi Guardians (or rather, the Sonozaki family behind them) was pulling the strings was apparent, but proving it wouldn't be easy.`
`And, with apologies to Ooishi, this incident was unlikely to go public.`
`If this caused an uproar, it would obviously lead to the Minister losing his office.`
`With HQ having decided that doing so was in the national interest, this would probably be cleaned up quietly.`
`It might be a rough way of saying it, but this was born in the shadows, and was going to die in the shadows.`
`...Ooishi probably already understood the implications behind this incident.`
`"For the time being, let's cordon off the area,`
` since it seems that one of them still has a gun.`
` After that, let's get Inukai-kun to safety and get you to the hospital."`
`As the tension in the situation faded, the pain from the gunshot wound in my shoulder blossomed once again.`
`My forehead was also stinging painfully, and had grown hot enough to start a fire.`
`Thinking that the tension had caused me to sweat, I wiped my forehead, but what came off was a large amount of blood.`
`I realized that my shirt had been stained bright crimson from the blood flowing from my head.`
`I turned around.`
`...The boy was safe and sound.`
` Without a doubt.`
`There would probably be an investigation on the men who ran, but that was for another day.`
`At this point in time, I could safely say we had cleared the major hurdle of securing the boy's safety.`
`As soon as I recognized that, it felt like the lights in my head had been hit by a power failure.`
`My knees buckled from underneath me, the ground there feeling as soft as a cloud.`
`It didn't feel unpleasant even as I was covered in the rain-soaked mud.`
`Ooishi came closer, asking if I was okay, but somehow I couldn't tell.`
`...I turned off the switch to the last light in my head.`
`The exhaustion enveloped me.`
` Sleep.`
` ...Something softer than any blanket wrapped around me...`
