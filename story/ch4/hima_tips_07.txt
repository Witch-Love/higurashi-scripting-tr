`"Your blood pressure has improved.`
` For you to recover this quickly at your age, I'm rather impressed.`
`At this rate, you'll still be kicking after a couple hundred more years, Oryou-san."`
`The young doctor in his medical coat said that as he undid the blood pressure cuff from the arm of the old woman tucked away in her futon.`
`"You're a very good physician, Dr. Irie...`
` If a persistent ol' fart like me doesn't hurry up and die, I'll just be in the way of you young folk...`
` ...Ho ho ho ho..."`
`The old lady, Oryou, laughed faintly with a broad smile on her face.`
`Then, turning towards the sliding door, she called out in a strong voice.`
`"Is Shimiko-san or Taeko-san there?`
` Bring some tea for Dr. Irie!"`
`The sound of rushed footsteps from the hallway drew closer, until finally the door slid smoothly open.`
`What it revealed was a young girl.`
` ...It looked like the old lady's granddaughter.`
`"Shimiko-san already left for the day.`
` ...Do you need something?"`
`"Mion, make some barley tea for Dr. Irie."`
`"Okay, got it.`
` Did you want some too, Granny?`
` Or would black tea be better?`
` Want lots of milk and sugar?"`
`"I'll measure it out myself, so you don't have to put any in.`
` Just bring the sugar jar and some milk when you bring the tea."`
`"Kay kay."`
`The girl named Mion, after giving a rather uninterested response to her taskmaster of a grandmother, returned to the hallway.`
`"Pour the doctor's tea in the cups for the guests!!`
` And make sure you bring a coaster too!`
` Also make sure to dry the outside of the glass, okay!?"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` You're such a fussypants."`
`A tired voice wafted a reply from down the hallway.`
`The apathetic tone of voice was far from unusual.`
` The old lady let a wry smile slip across her face as she chided the girl.`
`"Geez, that girl just won't learn.`
` Nothing I ever scold her about sticks."`
`"Now now, Oryou-san... you don't have to say that.`
` Mion-chan is doing her best in her own way, even though she's so young."`
`"Her mother was the same way... couldn't teach her anything.`
` The apple doesn't fall far from the tree!"`
`"Aha ha ha ha.`
` So her mother's mother must be exactly the same, no?"`
`The old lady burst out laughing.`
` Her expression showed she hadn't taken the comment the wrong way.`
`"Dr. Irie.`
` I'm sorry, but could you open the doors for me?`
` It seems there's a nice cool breeze outside."`
`The cool chirping of the higurashi had at some point started leaking through the gap in the doorway.`
`Irie stood up, and opened the door a bit.`
`...A refreshing breeze pushed out the stale air that had built up in the room.`
`"It's gotten fairly hot during the day, but the evenings are still rather cool, aren't they.`
` It was almost downright chilly last night."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Those types of mornings and evenings are another one of Hinamizawa's fine points."`
`Irie replied with a smile as he returned to sit on the cushion beside the old lady.`
`And then the two of them, for a little while, soaked in the voices of the higurashi...`
`"I'm going to try and live to a hundred.`
` ...Until the business with the dam is proper finished, I ain't kicking the bucket just yet."`
`"...To get the government to withdraw a decision they've already made is a fairly difficult thing to do..."`
`"The way this country does things is like turning a millstone.`
` A heavy one at that."`
`"...A millstone?"`
`"Don'tcha know??`
` A millstone."`
`Irie quickly affirmed that of course he knew what the old lady was talking about.`
`For he knew full well that Oryou didn't like having her stories interrupted.`
`"This millstone, see, can grind anything to a pulp.`
` It's rather impressive.`
` But y'see, it doesn't turn that easy, because it's a rather heavy millstone. `
`Lots of people have to work in unison to get it to even budge. It's that type of millstone."`
`Irie pursed his lips, listening quietly to what she was saying.`
`Eventually Mion returned with some tea laid out on a tray.`
`Seeing that Oryou was talking and in a good mood, she quietly knelt down and laid out the sets for the barley and black tea, careful not to interrupt.`
`"That's why, when it gets going, it's not that easy to stop.`
` ...It takes the most effort to move it right before it starts turning.`
` Everybody hates that, so everybody keeps pushing it along without rest."`
`"You're talking about friction, right?`
` I get what you're saying."`
`"So in other words.`
` If there's some sort of mistake, and the millstone suddenly stops turning... to get it turning again takes a great deal of power, more'r less."`
`"...Certainly, to get a project that's been suspended going again takes quite a lot of work."`
`"It's a millstone that isn't easily stopped.`
` ...But once it's stopped, it'll never turn again.`
` It's that kind of millstone."`
`"It'd be nice if there was some way to get that millstone to stop, wouldn't it?"`
`When Irie responded with that, Mion and the old lady suddenly sunk into silence...`
`Irie, instinctively thinking he had said something rude, searched in a small panic for the words to correct himself.`
`But that silence wasn't the result of rude words.`
`...For what crept across Mion and the old lady's faces were contemptuous smiles.`
`"...`
` ..."`
`The atmosphere surrounding Irie suddenly froze, leaving him flabbergasted.`
`...Thinking that the scornful smiles creeping across both of their faces was the result of some mistake of his, he could only grow afraid.`
`"...`
` ......"`
`"...Haha, hahahahahahaha..."`
`It hadn't been that long at all since he was enveloped by silence.`
`However, unable to stand it, Irie could only let out a weak laugh.`
`Irie's laugh eventually spread to Mion and the old lady.`
` Not knowing exactly what they were laughing at,`
` their laughter left a lingering chill.`
`...The only ones not laughing were the higurashi, who continued their simple and unchanging chorus...`
