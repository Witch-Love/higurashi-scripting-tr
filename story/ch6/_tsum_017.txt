`The next day, Rena came to school, acting normal like she said she would.`
`She talked with Mion as cheerfully as she always did, and it made me wonder if the story she told me last night was a complete fabrication.`
`That's because the story really was... too ridiculously crazy to believe.`
`This village has a very weird and rare endemic disease... and there are religious fanatics who want to use the disease to revive their weird cult. `
`...And they've been researching the pathogen of the endemic disease so they can spread it throughout the village...`
`I was deeply influenced by Rena last night, and I believed everything she said...`
` ...but thinking about it with a cool mind under the bright sunlight, it sounds too crazy to be true.`
`The story Rena told me is based on Takano-san's crazy hand-me-down ideas. It's based entirely on her theories, which, though very feasible, have no evidence whatsoever.`
`...The fact that Takano-san was murdered lends credit to the story. I'll give you that, but...`
`I looked at Mion.`
`She was fooling around with Rena.`
`...It's hard to believe that she's involved with some crazy conspiracy.`
`"Hey, are you listening, Kei-chan?"`
`"What?`
` Oh... ahh... I'm sorry.`
` I wasn't paying attention."`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
`Wake up, sleepyhead!`
` You need to get enough sleep, or your brain stops working!"`
`Mion made fun of me for reacting too slowly.`
`...It's almost impossible not to trust this bubbly, cheerful girl.`
`I trust Mion.`
` I trust my friends.`
`I know she'd never have a hand in a crazy conspiracy like that.`
`If she knew about it, she wouldn't be able to act this cheerfully.`
`...Rena told me not to tell Mion because she might be one of them...`
`But it might be worth telling her without letting Rena know.`
`...Of course, there's at least a 1% chance that the conspiracy is true and that Mion is one of them. If so, I'd be doomed.`
`But if I had to choose between believing the crazy conspiracy theory and trusting my friends, my answer would be obvious.`
`I know that my friend, Mion, isn't a part of any conspiracy. She'd never be involved with something like that.`
`Even if the conspiracy exists, I'm sure Mion will be on our side.`
`So, whether or not it's true, it must be worth telling Mion about it...`
`"What's going on, Kei-chan?`
` Why did you call me out here?`
`You told me not to tell anybody.`
` You're not going to extort money from me, are you?"`
`"Is that the first thing you think of when you're called out to the gymnasium storeroom...?"`
`"Oh, I know. You want to give me a love letter, don't you?`
` People usually use the shoe locker for that, you know?"`
`"We don't really do that in the city.`
` A lot of guys hand over their love letters in person."`
`"Really...?`
` So, wait... you're... ummm..."`
`"...Are you kidding me? That's not why I called you here.`
` I have to talk to you about something very important.`
` I want you to listen without making fun of me."`
`"...What... is it...?"`
`"Do you know... that there are people who want to revive the cult of Oyashiro-sama?"`
`".........Huh?`
` What? What are you talking about?"`
`This, of course, was just my way of getting a feel for the situation.`
`I wanted to see how she was going to react by getting straight to the point.`
`But Mion really did look puzzled.`
`...People wouldn't normally react like this if someone pointed out their secrets out of the blue.`
` They always panic, if only just a little.`
`Either Mion was a brilliant actress... or she really didn't have anything to do with the idea of reviving Oyashiro-sama.`
`...I decided to tell her everything.`
`"Mion,`
` your family, the Sonozaki family, has a lot of influence in this region, including Hinamizawa, right? `
`......Do you think there's a possibility that they're working to revive the cult of Oyashiro-sama behind the scenes...?"`
`"......Revive?`
` Why?"`
`"Well, you know,`
` people today don't worship Oyashiro-sama like the people in the old days did. `
`So... people like... fundamentalists might be trying to make people worship Oyashiro-sama in the same way as the people of Onigafuchi."`
`"What?`
` Wait a second.`
` I have no idea what you're talking about."`
`"...Are you sure...? You really have no idea what I'm talking about...?"`
`"Of course I don't!`
` It sounds like one of those popular novels that sold 5 million copies over in America."`
`Mion's reaction was very natural.`
`It seemed impossible that she was pretending she didn't know anything about it.`
` ...But regardless, I continued.`
`"Well...`
` There are people like that in this village for real.`
` Do you know anything about them?"`
`"You're saying that those people want to make us worship Oyashiro-sama like the people of Onigafuchi did...`
` What good will that do?"`
`"...You know... I think it means a lot to people who really believe..."`
`"But, think about it, Kei-chan.`
` Who'd be happy to live under those strict ancient rules?`
` In this day and age, it's almost impossible to live without leaving the village."`
`"But for example... think about Rika-chan!`
` All the old people say she's a reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, right?`
` Those people might be religious fanatics, and..."`
`"Are you talking about old man Kimiyoshi?`
`Well... I know he's a deeply religious man for sure, but he isn't a fanatic."`
`"Believe me!`
` There really are people who are trying to revive the cult of Oyashiro-sama!"`
`"Ah ha ha ha!`
`...Okay.`
` I'll believe you for now, because I want to hear the rest.`
` Go on."`
`"They found out that the curse of Oyashiro-sama was just an endemic disease unique to this village, so now they're researching the pathogen."`
`"Where?`
`First of all, what's an endemic disease?`
` What's a pathogen?`
` They sound gross."`
`I was getting confused. I didn't know what I was talking about myself anymore...`
`I was deeply influenced by Rena last night, and believed everything she said.`
` But... having said it all out loud, I started realizing how impossible the story sounded...`
`"What's going on with you?`
` Did Miyo-san tell you all this?"`
`"......!`
` ...How did you know?"`
`"She's infamous for this kind of thing.`
` She's an occult maniac. She always makes up crazy stories.`
` A few people have gotten badly taken in by her before. `
`She told me some of her stories once, and I remember they were actually very interesting.`
` Ah ha ha."`
`"...Is that...`
` true?"`
`"I think you've heard about this once or twice before, but this village had a unique culture back in the old days. `
`They did a lot of oppressive things, like having very strict rules, very strict punishments, and a bunch of other cruel traditions. They're well known among occult maniacs.`
` Miyo-san is one of them."`
`"So... the story I heard about the weird parasite that controls the village was..."`
`"What?!`
` Parasite?!`
`...Is that a new story she came up with?"`
`"What do you mean, 'new story'?"`
`"I told you. Miyo-san is an occult maniac.`
` She studies the weird legends surrounding Onigafuchi, and enjoys making up hypotheses, theories, and wild stories about them.`
`She's created a lot of different ones aside from that theory that parasites are controlling the village.`
` One I heard an awful while back was about UFOs. `
`That one was interesting, since it connected a lot of different dots!`
`The story was about a UFO that crashed into Onigafuchi Swamp long ago. The alien that was in the UFO and the villagers had a battle... or something like that. It was like one of those sci-fi horror B movies. `
`The one Satoko heard was a theory about creatures from the bottom of the ocean.`
` A movement in the Earth's crust opened up a connection between that underwater world and Onigafuchi, and......`
`the princess of the underworld fell in love with a young man in the village. It was like a sci-fi version of Romeo and Juliet.`
`The story about the parasites that you heard must be a new one. `
`I hope she makes all of them into a book one day. Heh heh heh!"`
`Mion began laughing so hard that she had to hold her stomach.`
`...As I looked at her laughing like that... I realized I fell for something that ridiculous.`
`At that point, it was obvious.`
`...I had been completely taken in.`
`"I'm sorry, Mion!`
` But please answer my questions!`
` First... Do the fanatics who are trying to revive the cult of Oyashiro-sama exist?!"`
`"No, they don't.`
` I mean, it's totally the opposite.`
` The Three Families have agreed to open Hinamizawa to outsiders in order to make this village thrive. `
`I'm not supposed to tell anybody about this, but there's a project to build a new highway by the end of the 20th century.`
` The Sonozaki family is promoting its construction without informing the villagers. `
`If all goes well, this whole area will flourish.`
` My grandma is betting she'll make a fortune when it causes land prices in the region to skyrocket. `
`Well, most of the work will happen in the 21st century, so I'll likely end up taking over the project."`
`"So... you don't think there are people who hate outsiders?"`
`"I told you! There are no such people!`
`What makes you think we want to make this village more inconvenient than it already is?`
`In fact, we've already started selling the land of the village to rich people who want to build country residences here.`
` Your house is on the first lot we sold, Kei-chan.`
`Didn't the villagers welcome you? `
`The Three Families are trying to do everything they can to stop young people from leaving the village."`
`There was nothing vague about what Mion had said.`
`Her story makes a lot more sense than Takano-san's delusional theories.`
`...And so, Mion's words woke me up from that delusion.`
`"So... what about this? I heard that the residents of Hinamizawa have extraordinarily high levels of something in their blood, and it proves that they're infected by parasites..."`
`"Really?`
` How did Miyo-san figure that out?"`
`"Takano-san is a nurse. I'm sure she can do that..."`
`"And you think anyone would give her blood samples for no reason?`
`Because I sure don't.`
` Even if she could get blood samples somehow, how and where would she examine them? `
`How many blood samples do you think she examined all by herself?"`
`...Mion was right.`
`I couldn't believe I thought Takano-san could do all that just because she was a nurse.`
`It struck me hard to believe that she got that many blood samples and did a high level examination like that without any help.`
`...When I thought about it rationally... I shouldn't have believed such a ridiculous story so easily.`
`"Umm... I heard that people here don't get hay fever, which is proof of their being infected by the parasite...!"`
`"Only people in cities get hay fever.`
` I heard it has something to do with fuel emissions.`
` Kei-chan, you're talking about Hinamizawa.`
` I mean, even people in Okinomiya don't get hay fever, I think."`
`"Well... what about this?!`
` I heard that the Sonozaki family has a death squad and that they kidnapped the grandson of a government Minister once!"`
`"Ah ha ha ha ha!`
` That sounds cool! I wish I had a squad like that!`
` Ah ha ha ha ha!"`
`...Even I was sounding ridiculous.`
`...But I believed all of it last night.`
`...I believed it because Rena looked very serious.`
`"It's true that the grandson of a Minister was found in Takatsudo.`
` We didn't do it.`
` We just acted as if we did."`
`"...What do you mean? Please explain."`
`"Okay.`
` The Onigafuchi Guardians protested violently during the dam conflict.`
` They did something close to terrorism as well.`
` But there were people who used the resistance movement for their own benefits. `
`They used the name of the Onigafuchi Guardians to rob people of money and valuables."`
`The Onigafuchi Guardians were a very aggressive force at that time.`
`There's a high possibility that some people thought they could use the name to extort money.`
`"The kidnapping case was one of those incidents.`
` The kidnappers thought they could stifle the police investigation by acting like they were the Onigafuchi Guardians. They kidnapped the boy to demand a ransom.`
`To tell you the truth, the members of the Onigafuchi Guardians were all very surprised.`
` They were actually impressed that those guys actually pulled it off.`
` I remember they even said they'd give them an award."`
`"W-Wait a second!`
` So, the Onigafuchi Guardians had nothing to do with...`
` the kidnapping?!"`
`"No.`
` Not at all."`
`Mion said it firmly.`
`It was a simple and clear answer, which left no room for suspicion.`
`And thinking about it, it's nothing surprising.`
`Kidnapping the grandson of a Minister and negotiating with him in person is a huge deal.`
`The Onigafuchi Guardians were a very aggressive group, but this operation wasn't so easy that it could be carried out by any of the normal residents of Hinamizawa. `
`It was obviously the work of professional criminals, without a doubt!`
`"...Like I said earlier,`
` the Sonozaki family acted as if we were the masterminds of the kidnapping case."`
`"What do you mean by that...?"`
`"...This is... a secret precept of the Sonozaki family.`
` You can't tell anybody about this, okay?!`
`When an incident like this happens, we traditionally act as if we're responsible for it. It's a tradition of bluffing."`
`"......Bluffing...!`
` Really?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it works out in our favor. It can be a criminal incident,`
` the weather, or even lottery numbers. `
`We act as if it happened because the Sonozaki family wanted it to happen.`
`It starts to sound like we're a very powerful organization,`
` doesn't it?`
` That's the point. `
`This is the secret strategy that only the Sonozaki family heads know about.`
` This strategy is meant to make us look bigger and stronger than we really are."`
`"....Wow.........`
` So... what about the plan they had during the dam conflict? The one to attack the Ministry of Construction.`
` Was that true?`
` I heard that they obtained weapons and even trained for it...!"`
`"Heh heh heh heh!`
` That was the spin we put on it.`
` There's no way we could actually carry out a crazy plan like that!`
`Our real goal was to make people believe that we were capable of doing things like that so we could exact pressure on the government.`
` That's all."`
`They obtained weapons and went through training just so they could exact pressure. They had no intention of actually carrying out the plan.`
` ...The Sonozaki family was just bluffing...`
`That made sense.`
` Of course it did...!`
`It's impossible to attack the Ministry of Construction. Even if they did, it wouldn't solve the problem! All I had to do was use common sense!`
`Even if they did, they would have been crushed within seconds by a huge number of policemen! Why didn't I think of that?`
`"What about the weapons and the training...?"`
`"As for the weapons... no comment. Aha ha ha!`
` But we did go through training.`
` We needed to do that in order to make the bluff look real!`
`We gathered some younger men from my father's office and appointed Kasai-san as leader of the group. We went to a desert in Texas, played war games with some instructors, and went sightseeing in San Francisco afterwards. `
`Ah ha ha ha ha."`
`"So... So......"`
`I couldn't think of anything else.`
` ...It was obvious now.`
`I... no, Rena and I both...`
` ...were completely fooled by the scrapbooks of Takano-san's delusion...`
`Rena was so serious about it, so I believed her... but if you examined it closely, there were so many inconsistencies.`
`I couldn't believe Rena took a delusion like that so seriously.`
`...I knew the reason why, though.`
`...She was still in a state of shock after being caught with the corpses that day. She was mentally unstable.`
`Then she came across this tall tale... and she believed it.`
`Rena is a smart girl.`
` She wouldn't have taken it seriously if she was stable!`
`Plus, another thing happened to wake me up from the delusion.`
`The white van I saw yesterday came to school during the lunch break. The four men in work uniforms I saw were there, too.`
`I said thank you to Mion, and followed them.`
`The man who talked to me yesterday knocked on the door of the teacher's office.`
`"Hello. I'm from the Okonogi Gardeners."`
`"Oh, thank you for coming.`
` It's very hot today, isn't it?"`
`"It sure is. By the way, you look very beautiful today, as always. Eh heh heh!"`
`"Thank you. Well, you can start whenever you're ready."`
`"Yes, we'll start right away.`
` My account manager told me to give this to you."`
`"The quote and the invoice, I see.`
` The date is left blank on both of them.`
` Well, there shouldn't be any problem.`
` Thank you so much."`
`"All right. We'll start right away!"`
`The man was talking to Chie-sensei with a big smile.`
`"...Mm?`
` What are you doing here, Maebara-kun?"`
`"Oh, Principal...`
` Who is that guy...?"`
`The principal pointed his finger at the window.`
` When I looked out, I heard the noise of an engine starting.`
`The noise was coming from the engine of a motorized lawn mower.`
`I saw young men in work uniforms taking another lawn mower, some brooms, and a ladder out of the van.`
`"They're gardeners.`
` We haven't taken care of the grass around the fence and the trees for a long time.`
` I wanted to clean them up before summer."`
`"Mr. Principal, thank you for giving us a call!"`
`The man noticed the principal, took off his hat, and bowed.`
`"No need!`
` I trust your work. Please take care of things."`
`"I think we can finish it today.`
` We might make a lot of noise, though."`
`Each worker took one of the tools and walked towards the fence where the grass was growing.`
`The engine of the lawn mower was very loud, and the kids who were playing in the school yard looked at it curiously.`
`"Hey!!`
` It's dangerous out here. Go back to your classroom!"`
`It was Chie-sensei.`
`She handed an envelope with the documents in it to the principal.`
`It said "Okonogi Gardeners" in green on the envelope.`
`"Principal,`
` please sign the invoice and drop it off at their office next time you go to the town hall."`
`"Of course.`
` Will do."`
`"Ah... Chie-sensei.`
` Did they come here yesterday?"`
`"Yes.`
` They came here to look at the grass late in the afternoon.`
` They told me they got lost on the way back because they tried to take a shortcut."`
`"This village has a lot of small roads branching off everywhere,`
` and they can be very confusing."`
`"I remember when I first came here..." Chie-sensei started talking about when she got lost, and they laughed together.`
`There was... never anything suspicious to begin with.`
`...I thought they were suspicious yesterday... because of what Rena had told me.`
`At first, I thought it wasn't unusual to see a white van.`
`But then, right after I heard her creepy story, I saw a white van parked on the road, and I got scared.`
`The gardeners weren't familiar with the roads of Hinamizawa, and they got lost trying to take a shortcut on their way back.`
`That's all.`
`............I`
` had it totally twisted around?!`
`I believed that fake-sounding story. I believed that the Sonozaki family was working behind the scenes, and I fabricated the existence of a group of fanatical believers in my mind.`
` Worse, I doubted Mion!`
`Damn it!!`
` I'm such a fool!`
` She's my friend!`
`We took each other's hands that day, saying that we were a family made of friends, and that friends were friends no matter what!`
`I said that... but then, I doubted my friend... I'm so stupid...!!`
`...Anyway, Rena was the problem!`
`She also needed to wake up from this crazy delusion!!`
`I had to hurry and wake her up.`
`Rena seemed like she had no mind to listen to anyone else.`
`She truly believes that the Sonozaki family are the masterminds of a large-scale conspiracy...!`
`I remembered the plate number of the white van, and I also remembered their faces.`
`...Without a doubt, this was one of the vans that have been following me!`
`So far, I've confirmed that three or four cars have been following me.`
`I could especially recall this white van because it followed me around the longest of all.`
`The people who were in the other cars must be the lookouts, and the ones in this van must be tasked with direct contact, like kidnapping or assassination.`
`The lookouts secure the surroundings, and the ones in this van attack the target...!`
`That's a common maneuver involved in both kidnapping and assassination. The scrapbooks said that, too.`
`...If so, I'd better watch out because it was them, not the lookouts, who came to the school premises.`
`I don't think they'll attack me while I'm in school.`
`They're in the early stage of their covert operation now, hiding their fangs and claws until the last stage of their horrifying scheme.`
`...That's why they won't take action in the school, where people are watching...!`
`But it looked like they were talking with Chie-sensei in a very friendly way.`
`I could only hear bits and pieces of their conversation, but it sounded very suspicious.`
`I tried to remember the chatter and the movements of their mouths, and I played my memory of it like a video tape in my mind.`
`"Hello. XXXXXXXXXXXXX."`
`"Oh, thank you for coming.`
` It's very hot today, isn't it?"`
`"It sure is. XXXXX you XXXXXXXXXXXXX today XXXXXXXXX. Eh heh heh!"`
`"Thank you. Well, you can start whenever you're ready."`
`"Yes, we'll start right away.`
` My account manager told me to give this to you."`
`"The XXXXXX and XXXXXXXX, I see.`
` XXXXXXX is left blank on XXXXXXX.`
` Well, there shouldn't be any problem.`
` Thank you so much."`
`"All right. We'll XXXXX!"`
`I used the information I had to guess what was going on. I played the video again and again in my mind, and also paused it and played it in slow motion again to check many times.`
`...Then, something unbelievably horrifying started to emerge.`
`There's no doubt that they're acquainted with Chie-sensei.`
`...But I've never seen them visit this school before. So, it's hard to believe that Chie-sensei is their contact.`
`There's no doubt that they're the death squad under the direct control of the Sonozaki family.`
`They have the local accent, which proves they were chosen from the Sonozaki corps.`
`The death squad was talking with Chie-sensei.`
` They know each other.`
` What's their relationship?`
`Who's Chie-sensei, anyway?`
`During the dam conflict, Hinamizawa's school was closed and it was merged with the one in Okinomiya.`
`...But the Onigafuchi Guardians didn't accept that, and they made a part of the forestry service building into a school.`
`But needless to say, the school they made didn't have a teacher.`
`So, it was only going to be a token form of resistance.`
` ...But a teacher who had a strong passion for education felt sorry for the children, and she came to work there.`
`That was Rumiko Chie-sensei.`
`...It was obviously strange. Teachers are government employees, and they normally belong to their prefectures.`
`As long as they lie low and don't cause trouble, they don't get fired, and they don't get demoted.`
`They can work up until the official retirement age, and they're guaranteed to get a fixed retirement fund.`
`She was one of those government employees, but she defied the Board of Education and came to work for Hinamizawa.`
`The villagers admire her as 'a teacher of passion'.`
`...I heard that Oryou Sonozaki herself successfully negotiated with the Board of Education that suspended Chie-sensei for defying their orders.`
`...It was easy to get an answer from this by connecting the dots.`
`Chie-sensei was recruited by Oryou Sonozaki as a teacher to work at the "school" the Onigafuchi Guardians had created.`
`In other words, she was already working for Oryou before she came here!`
`As for the principal, he was the principal of the school in Hinamizawa from the beginning.`
`He's a respected person of this region, and he's been closely associated with the Three Families for a long time.`
` So, that means...`
`This school has been under the control of the Sonozaki family all along!`
`That's why Chie-sensei is acquainted with the death squad. It makes sense now.`
`...Chie-sensei confirmed that I came to school today, made a phone call`
` ...and called them here...?!`
`...I don't want to know why she called them here.`
`If she called them just to monitor me, they'd wait near the gate until class was over.`
`But they came onto the school premises... Why...?`
`Stop pretending to be a fool, Rena Ryuugu!`
`Do you think nothing will happen if you pretend not to notice it?!`
`Think. Think hard. And calm down, Rena Ryuugu!!`
`What will they try to do to me today in school?`
`In school?!`
`How are they going to do anything with my classmates and friends around me?!`
`It's easy.`
`Chie-sensei will tell me to come to the teachers' office during the last class of the day.`
`What about my clubmates?`
`That's easy, too. Chie-sensei can easily make them go home early using her authority as a teacher.`
`She can make up any reason she wants. Maybe the classroom is going to have carpentry work done today, so they can't stay in school.`
`"It sure is. XXXXX you XXXXXXXXXXXXX today XXXXXXXXX. Eh heh heh!"`
`"Thank you. Well, you can start whenever you're ready."`
`...See? There's no doubt...`
`They clearly said "they're ready to do it today"!!`
`And... what else...?`
`"Yes, we'll start right away.`
` My account manager told me to give this to you."`
`"The XXXXXX and XXXXXXXX, I see.`
` XXXXXXX is left blank on XXXXXXX.`
` Well, there shouldn't be any problem.`
` Thank you so much."`
`I see.`
` They gave Chie-sensei an envelope with some documents in it.`
`...That "blank" is an eerie phrase.`
`...Was my name supposed to be in the blank...?`
`Why is it left "blank"? What does that mean?`
`I told you, Rena Ryuugu!`
`Do you still think that nothing will happen if you pretend not to notice it? Stop that!!`
`So, what it must mean...`
`Is that it's an order from higher up.`
` It says to make "Rena Ryuugu"`
` become "blank"!!`
`I took a peek from the shadows, and I saw the principal taking documents out from the envelope. He started reading them.`
`He looked stern... He looked very serious.`
`...I wished I could take a peek at the documents, but I was too far away.`
`I kept looking at him just to see if he'd react at all. ...And then, the envelope caught my eye.`
`The envelope said "Okonogi Gardeners" and it had some numbers that looked like a phone number.`
`Fortunately, I have good eyesight.`
`...I memorized the number.`
`If they're a death squad, the gardening company must be a camouflage occupation.`
` It probably doesn't even exist.`
`I wanted to find out. I looked for a phone.`
`...There's only one phone, and it's in the teachers' office.`
`Fortunately, the teachers were chatting in the hallway, looking at the gardeners.`
` It was now or never.`
`I made sure nobody was watching me go into the teachers' office. I rushed in and grabbed the phone on the principal's desk.`
`I went over the phone number in my head, and dialed it up.`
`...I'm glad they have a touch-tone phone.`
` It would've been difficult if it was a rotary dial.`
`If somebody answered, I'd only have to ask "is this the Okonogi Gardeners?"`
`I'd wait for the answer before hanging up. It should be easy.`
`It connected!`
`"...The number you dialed is..."`
`I felt a cold chill run through my body from the bottom of my feet.`
`Wait. Don't make a quick judgment...`
`I might've remembered the number wrong.`
`...No. I know I remembered it right.`
`It was an easy number to remember.`
` It's impossible to remember it wrong.`
` Then, did I dial it wrong?`
`I put the phone down and started over. This time, I dialed the number more slowly.`
`The teachers might be coming back at any time. In that situation, it was risky to do anything slowly.`
` But... I needed to make absolutely sure.`
`"...The number you dialed is..."`
`It's... the same.`
`...There's no doubt.`
`The company "Okonogi Gardeners" doesn't exist.`
`It's just a camouflage occupation for the Sonozaki family's death squad!!`
`"...Please make sure the number you dialed is correct.`
` ...The number you dialed is..."`
`I was too stunned to put down the receiver. The announcement kept running over and over again. The voice was cold and creepy.`
`I hung up the phone and rushed out of the teachers' office.`
`I ran to the bathroom and held my head in an attempt to cool down.`
`Calm down, Rena.`
` Calm down, Rena Ryuugu.`
` Stay cool.`
` Rena Ryuugu...!`
`I wasn't safe here anymore.`
`If I stayed here, I might be erased, even in the open.`
`They'd erase me?`
` Why?!`
` They aren't certain that I have the scrapbooks...!`
`.........I...`
` told Keiichi-kun...`
` where I hid the scrapbooks.`
` ......Yesterday, I told him I hid them in my hideout`
` in the garbage dump......`
` Is Keiichi-kun...`
` in cahoots...`
` with`
` the Sonozaki family...?`
`I felt as if my head was a pot that was cooking some dubious stew. There was only soup in my brain.`
`I cut up clues, information, and facts just like I'd cut vegetables, and threw them into the pot.`
`Some of them were floating on the surface, and others were on the bottom of the pot. They were being cooked in a boiling soup...`
`...No, it can't be. Keiichi-kun is on my side.`
` He's the only one who's on my side.`
` ...He held out his hand to me at the trash piles. There was no lie in that hand... `
`When he grabbed my wrist, I felt nothing but his strong and pure heart. He promised me he'd be on my side...! `
`I shouldn't doubt Keiichi-kun. He's the only one I should trust. He's the only one who is on my side right now...!!`
`"...I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Keiichi-kun...`
` I was about to doubt you...`
` I'm really sorry,`
` I'm so sorry..."`
`I said it out loud on purpose, full of regret that I doubted Keiichi-kun, the only one who is on my side.`
`...Now that I think about it, whether I have the scrapbooks or not might not matter to them.`
`Erase anyone who is suspicious!`
`That's the safest way.`
`...Does that mean... they're in a hurry?`
`"The Day of Oyashiro-sama's Revival" might be just around the corner...`
` And that's why they're trying to get rid of any small fish bones that are stuck in the throat, by any means, before it's too late.`
`We don't need her anymore.`
` ...Just erase her if you're worried so much...`
`I could easily picture Oryou Sonozaki saying that.`
`...Picture?`
`No, she DID say that!`
`That's why they're here today!!`
`What should I do? What should I do?`
`Should I wait until school is over?!`
`I was like a fish in a pond.`
`No matter how many times I escaped from the net, I was in the pond, and they <i>own</i> the pond. I didn't stand a chance!`
`Then, what should I do now?!`
`I couldn't keep escaping from the net. I should get out of the pond!`
`...I didn't know how to fight them. I didn't know who's on my side. I was about to give in to despair. `
`...For now, I'd have to think about how to survive this, so I'd at least have time to think about how to fight against them.`
`I have to get out of this pond...!`
`When I was about to leave the bathroom, one of my classmates came in.`
`I pretended to be sick and talked to the girl while leaning on the wall.`
`"I...`
` don't feel good...`
` I think I better go home. Can you tell Chie-sensei I left school early...?"`
`I shouldn't let Chie-sensei know that I'm leaving school early if I'm trying to run away from them.`
`But if I didn't, they might think I ran away without cause.`
`That might lead them to chase after me without mercy.`
` If that happens, I don't stand a chance!`
`They were planning to capture me after school is over, but I 'happened' to feel sick and left school early.`
`...If they took it that way, they wouldn't think that I noticed the noose tightening around me.`
`I was about to go back to the classroom to get my bag, but I changed my mind and turned around.`
`I didn't need my bag anymore.`
`I realized nobody was watching me, so I stopped pretending to be sick, and started running.`
`"...Mmmmm?`
` Chie-sensei, take a look at this."`
`"Take a look?`
` Is something wrong with the documents?"`
`"Yes.`
` The date on the quote and the invoice are left blank.`
` They're supposed to put today's date here."`
`"Oh, they wanted to leave them blank.`
` They said they couldn't put the same date on the quote and the invoice.`
` They're told to leave them blank by General Affairs."`
`"Okay, then.`
` And this. The phone number on the invoice is different from the one on the envelope.`
` Do you know which is the correct one?"`
`"Oh, I didn't notice that.`
` ...Hello, excuse me!"`
`"Yes?`
` What's the matter?"`
`"The phone number on the invoice is different from the one on the envelope. Which one is correct?"`
`"Oh!!`
` Ah ha ha ha ha!`
` It's the one on the invoice!`
` I used the old envelope we used to use at our former office.`
` I'm sorry about that. `
`I told our part-timer to add a stamp with the new phone number, but I guess she forgot.`
` I apologize for the confusion.`
` Can you just erase the number?`
` Wha ha ha ha ha...!"`
