`"Welcome!`
` Would you like a hot dog?"`
`"Our shaved ice is the best you've ever tasted!`
` You can have it with strawberry syrup, melon syrup, or Hawaiian blue syrup!"`
`"Try our takoyaki roulette!`
` The winner's packed with a ton of mustard!"`
`There are a great many booths at this year's Watanagashi festival.`
`Anything can become a festival if there are vendors selling food and music for Bon dances, I thought.`
`It's still June, but it had been extremely hot the past few days, almost as if it's already summer.`
`When you have a June festival with Bon dance music under this kind of weather, the only thing that's missing to make it a perfect summer festival is fireworks.`
`"Bzzt, bzzzt!`
` This is Kumagai.`
` Ooishi-san, can you hear me? Over."`
`I heard a voice coming from my portable radio.`
`...With this earphone, it looks a little like I'm secretly listening to the horse races while on duty.`
`"This is Ooishi.`
` I can hear you loud and clear."`
`"The town councilors gave us a lot of food.`
` ...We have oden, yakisoba, pork belly stew,`
` and... umm,`
` some barley tea."`
`"Na ha ha!`
` Do you mean the barley tea we can drink on duty`
` or the one we can't drink on duty?"`
`"Eh, well...`
` ...Ah ha ha ha."`
`"If it's a canned drink, I'll take it.`
` If it's in a cup, don't worry about it."`
`"Roger that.`
` ...Ah, and all the members of the town council are here to say hi.`
` We have the mayor and the head of the Sonozaki family, too..."`
`"...What, that old bag Oryou is there?`
` Can you tell her that I'm patrolling right now and don't know when I'll be back?"`
`"...Well, I don't think I can do that for you, sir... She knows you have a portable radio, so she told me to call you and to bring you back here. She looks really mad..."`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` I'm sure it'll be a stroke that kills her.`
` Roger that. Tell her with extreme courtesy that I'll be back soon.`
` Please."`
`...Oh well. I guess I'll have to go back`
` and mingle with the locals.`
`All of a sudden, a group of kids came running towards me from behind.`
`After a quick look at them... I noticed that they were the granddaughter of the old bag and her friends.`
`They occupied a corner of the shooting gallery stall, making a lot of noise.`
`Mion Sonozaki.`
`...When acting her age, she's a cute, normal girl.`
`But do I ever hate it when she acts like a member of the Sonozaki family.`
`She'll be the boss of the Okinomiya yakuza territory in 10 or 20 years, just you wait and see.`
`...And while I was thinking things like that...`
`I noticed that Mion wasn't the one taking leadership of her group this time. It was the boy.`
`That boy... I know him. He just moved here recently.`
`The boy from the Maebara mansion.`
` Keiichi Maebara-kun, was it?`
`I heard that the Maebara family is from the city, and they're supposedly very rich, too.`
`...But he doesn't flaunt his family's wealth, and he has a good reputation because of that.`
`Even though he just moved here, he's already adjusted to his new school, and he's popular with his classmates, too.`
`Everyone in the village seems to like him as well.`
`He's very interesting to watch, as a person of many moods.`
`Boys of his age sure have a lot of energy.`
` Ah, to be young again.`
`"Hey, you're up next, Rena!!`
` You're lucky it's your turn!"`
`"Rena, are you okay?`
` Are you feeling sick?"`
`"...Ahaha, I'm sorry.`
` I guess I have to pass on taking a shot."`
`"......Okay, you should take a break for a bit."`
`"So!`
` That would make it my turn, no?!`
` Victory shall be mine!!"`
`...It looked like only four of them were having a good time. The girl called Rena seemed outside of that circle of smiles.`
`Her name is Rena Ryuugu.`
`What was her real name...?`
`I couldn't remember, but I can check when I get back to the station.`
` Rena is only a nickname.`
`I believe she moved here a year before Maebara-kun did.`
`Her mother divorced her father, or something like that.`
`She's a strong girl who does all the housework by herself.`
`She's a very modest girl, I'm told, which is rare in this era.`
`Unlike Maebara-kun, it seemed like she hadn't really opened up to her friends just yet.`
`They had looked like a group of five, but there's distance between her and the others. It's a little sad, you know.`
`Maebara-kun has become a part of the village... but Rena is still by herself.`
` ...Well, that's just how it looks to me.`
`"Bzz!`
` Ooishi-san, the chief and the section manager are here.`
` Please come back as soon as possible!"`
`"Roger that!`
` ...I can't believe the chief came all the way here just to say hi to the locals.`
` I guess he's very dedicated to community service, eh?"`
`"Ah......`
` This is Takasugi.`
` Ooishi-san,`
` can you hear me?`
` Do you copy? Over!"`
`"Yes, yes, I hear you.`
` I'm on my way back right now.`
` I'll be there in a minute."`
`If I don't hurry up, even the chief might end up calling me.`
`I ran back to the headquarters tent.`
`"Ooishi-san, Dr. Irie is here."`
`"Oh, thank you so much for coming!`
` So, what do you think, Dr. Irie?"`
`Ooishi entered the cordoned-off area.`
`In there, people from forensics were taking pictures of the corpse from various angles.`
`Irie was squatting down next to the dead body of Jirou Tomitake.`
` ...When he stood up, he looked pale.`
`".........I can't believe it."`
`"...I know. I can't believe it either.`
` As far as I see... he clawed out his throat`
` with his bare hands.`
`This isn't a normal way to go.`
` Most likely, it was the cause of some drug or something."`
`"......Are you saying he was a drug addict?"`
`"Who knows?`
`I guess it's going to be my job to find that out."`
`"...Ooishi-san,`
` what's with this two-by-four?"`
`"Maybe... he was swinging it around?`
` Then he threw it away, and had more fun clawing at his throat, I guess."`
`"...Why was he swinging a piece of lumber around?"`
`"He probably did it in self-defense.`
`...Did you notice there are several external injuries on his body?"`
`"...Yes. I can see some bruises."`
`"The easiest explanation I can think of... is that he was attacked by someone on his way home to Okinomiya from the festival. `
`He was seized by the culprit, given a shot of some kind of dangerous drug, went crazy, and died."`
`"...I've never heard of any drug that can make people claw out their throats."`
`"I'm not a specialist... but many drug addicts injure themselves when they're in a terminal condition.`
` Well, I'm sure the old man in forensics will take care of the investigation."`
`"Excuse me, Ooishi-san!`
` We found a bicycle believed to belong to Jirou Tomitake about a hundred meters away from here."`
`"Oh, that's great. Thanks for the find.`
` Any other clues?"`
`"Not yet.`
` They're investigating it right now."`
`"So, that means...`
` the place where the bicycle was found is most likely the place he was attacked.`
`...And then he ran away from the suspect and ended up here...`
` ...hnnnn."`
`Ooishi frowned, crossing his arms in front of his chest.`
`Irie was looking at the miserable corpse of Tomitake, and he kept saying the same thing over and over.`
`"............It's impossible.`
` .........It's just impossible."`
`"...Doctor, it happened, so it was possible, okay?`
` Try to think flexibly.`
` ...Although, I get that you don't really see something like this every day, despite being a doctor.`
`...Anyway, thanks for your cooperation. `
`You can go home now.`
` We called you here for emergency medical care, but it looks like it was a waste of a trip. Sorry."`
`Ooishi stuck his head out of the blue tent and asks, "can anybody give him a ride home?"`
`Irie gasped all of a sudden as he turned to Ooishi.`
`"What about... Takano-san?`
` What happened to Takano-san?!"`
`"What?`
` Oh, your nurse?"`
`"I think she was with him.`
` Is she okay?!"`
`"...Do you know her phone number?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Kuma-chan.`
` Get her phone number from Dr. Irie and make someone at the station call her house."`
`"Understood!`
` Doctor, can I have the number?"`
`"Yes, um, here it is."`
`Kumagai got the phone number from Irie, repeated it back, and then dashed away from the blue tarps.`
`"Doctor.`
` ...Takano-san and Tomitake-san were close friends, right?"`
`"Yes."`
`"...Have you heard about any troubles between them?"`
`"No.`
` ......Not even once.`
` They were very close."`
`"Well, I hope she's okay.`
` ...In the worst case, she could be dead, or she could be the culprit.`
` ...Nn, I see. Nurses have access to dangerous drugs..."`
`"...We don't have anything like that in my clinic. Even if we did, we'd be extra careful with them.`
` There's no way Takano-san could smuggle out a drug from my clinic..."`
`"But it's easier for nurses to do it than for regular people, right?"`
`"Like I said, I've never heard of a drug like that, and I don't have anything like that in my clinic...!"`
`"Ooishi-san, she isn't at home.`
` The standby unit says they're going to go to her house to check.`
` Doctor, can you give me her address?"`
`"Kuma-chan,`
` can you also check if the police headquarters has found any unidentified female bodies tonight?`
` ...Maybe we should check the other prefectures, too.`
`Tell the section manager if he can call the headquarters in the nearby prefectures and ask if they have any unidentified female bodies."`
`"Yes sir!"`
`".........Are you saying that Takano-san`
` might also be dead...?"`
`"Well, nfu fu, I don't know.`
` I don't know if she's dead, or if she's the culprit.`
`Of course, it's possible she's not involved at all.`
` She might just be getting drunk in a bar somewhere."`
`"...It's unbelievable...`
` Who does things like this...?"`
`"Well, it's unbelievable to me, too.`
` This fits with the rest of the mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
` ...It's been five years now.`
` That would make this the fifth curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`...Damn it. I've got to get whoever's behind it this year for sure...!`
` I really want to put an end to these cases before I retire."`
`Ooishi hates 'the curse of Oyashiro-sama'. It had been leading him around by the nose for five consecutive years.`
`...The victim of the first year, the manager of the dam construction site, was his friend.`
`Despite his desire to avenge his friend, the mystery had only deepened, and one case followed another year after year.`
`Ooishi would be retiring next March.`
`...As a retiree, he'd be able to ask about the progress of the investigation, but he wouldn't be able to take the initiative anymore.`
`In other words... this year was his last chance for revenge.`
`.........Would he have to put his head in the lion's mouth to capture the culprit?`
`Ooishi quietly clenched his fist.`
`I believe.`
`I believe that this maze has an exit.`
`"Maze" is a very convenient word.`
`A maze always has an exit.`
`You don't call it a maze if it doesn't have one.`
`I know I'm on the right path towards the exit of this maze. I used to miss these minor divergences, but now I don't miss anything. I don't make any mistakes.`
`This time I could feel a response that was different than all the other times.`
`I'm sure I can finally get to the exit of this maze.`
`But`
`............`
` no matter which path I choose to come to this point,`
` Jirou Tomitake always`
` dies.`
