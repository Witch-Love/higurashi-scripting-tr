`"I'm pregnant."`
`She has to divorce because she got pregnant. She has to get married because she got pregnant.`
` That's a lie!`
` That's a big lie...!!`
`"I'm a Christian, so I can't get an abortion.`
` He'll just have to accept it.`
` Plus, we had sex with marriage in mind.`
`He made me pregnant. If he changes his mind and takes no responsibility, it's going to be a big mess, you know?"`
