`First of all, I wasn't very close to Miyo-san.`
`I knew who she was, so I greeted her whenever we happened to pass by.`
` ...But that was about it.`
`I never really talked to her except for the one time.`
`...And that time was only recently.`
`It was between the day of the Watanagashi festival and...`
` the day I was caught in the act of burying the two corpses by Keiichi-kun and my other friends.`
`I had a phone call from the library that evening, and I was told that my father needed to return the book he borrowed.`
`He was shopping at the home improvement store at the time, so I went to the library to return the book for him.`
`While I was there, I thought about borrowing some books for myself, and I started walking around the library.`
` ...I saw her there.`
`"Oh, Rena-chan.`
` Hello."`
`"Miyo-san.`
` Hello to you too.`
` I didn't expect to see you here."`
`"Really?`
` I was going to say the same thing. I always spend time here, and I've never seen you.`
` Hee hee."`
`She smiled in the very attractive and charming way that only mature women can do.`
` ...Her smile gave no indication that she knew her death was just a few days away.`
`She said that she often met with Tomitake-san at the library.`
`It seemed like she had some time to kill, so she told me she wanted to buy me a drink.`
`I had nothing to do after that.`
`I let her buy me a canned iced milk tea from the vending machine in the library, and we talked for a while.`
`...Once I came to think about it, it was a little ironic.`
`She mostly talked about the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
`She had no idea that she was going to be the victim of its fifth year.`
`"...The series of... mysterious deaths...?"`
`"You've heard about it at least once, haven't you?`
` Four years ago, the manager of the dam construction site was murdered.`
` Three years ago, the Houjou couple died.`
` Two years ago, the Furude couple died. `
`And last year, it was Satoko-chan's aunt. The series of mysterious deaths have been going on for four years now.`
` And in a few days, it'll be the fifth..."`
`"I... I've heard about it...`
` But you don't know for sure that somebody will die this year..."`
`"I do.`
` ...Someone will die in a few days for sure.`
` There's that old saying, 'everything that happens twice will happen a third time'... So isn't it also true that what happens four times will happen a fifth?"`
`Miyo-san was convinced that the fifth mysterious death was going to happen, but she didn't know she was going to be the fifth victim...`
` That's ironic, and also really creepy.`
`But there was always something creepy about her.`
` So maybe she knew that she was going to be killed in a few days, but still managed to make that mysterious smile.`
`The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
`...Of course, I know about it. I've lived here for more than a year.`
`Every year on the day of the Watanagashi festival, one traitor to the village dies mysteriously. It's been that way since the dam conflict.`
`Each case was solved individually... but mysterious incidents still happen every year.`
`It makes me wonder if there's some kind of 'will' to all this...`
`...The creepiness and incomprehensibility of it all gave rise to the name "the curse of Oyashiro-sama," which fit perfectly.`
`...Despite this, I always thought 'the curse of Oyashiro-sama' was just a series of coincidences.`
`My reason for that is because I strongly believe that Satoshi-kun was the one who murdered his aunt on the fourth year.`
`I don't have any evidence... but I just know it.`
`I know that Satoshi-kun was in a serious predicament last year, and that he had nowhere to turn.`
`He had no one to help him, but he had to save Satoko-chan as soon as he could.`
`...Satoshi-kun thought it through and made the "best choice" he could to handle the situation, just like I did when I had my problem with Rina.`
`I hesitated to inform Miyo-san that Satoshi-kun was the murderer on the fourth year, so I just listened to her for a while.`
`According to her theory, the series of the mysterious deaths isn't just a set of coincidences, but is instead a series of interrelated murder cases.`
`At that point, my theory was completely the opposite of hers, but I decided not to cut in.`
`"You know about the cult of Oyashiro-sama here in Hinamizawa, don't you?"`
`Takano-san started telling me that Hinamizawa was once called "Onigafuchi".`
`She also explained the story of how the villagers were in the old days, showing me the scrapbook she was so proud of. The villagers back then were called man-eating demons, but they were also admired as "transcendents," enlightened people not bound by earthly desires.`
`"...So according to your theory,`
` a group of cultists who worship Oyashiro-sama are living in Hinamizawa, and they're trying to show the power of their god by enacting the series of mysterious deaths... right?"`
`"I'm not sure if we should call them cultists or fundamentalists. The line between them is very vague. `
`In the Meiji era, when the name of the village was changed to Hinamizawa, the customs and the traditions of Onigafuchi were brought to an end. `
`I think there are some people who want to revive those traditions and regain the name and awe of Onigafuchi."`
`Miyo-san's theory was more than a little crazy, but it was also fascinating.`
`At first, her theory had sounded like she was just jumping to conclusions... but after she eagerly showed me the documents she'd been studying, I started to think that it wasn't actually too far from the truth.`
`<size=-2>If her theory was true, it would mean that the accidental deaths of the Houjou couple in the second year, the suicide and the death by disease of the Furude couple in the third year, and the drug addict murderer in the fourth year were all cooked up.`
`It'd mean someone who has a lot of power and influence over the police was involved.`
`If her theory was true, it would mean that the accidental deaths of the Houjou couple in the second year, the suicide and the death by disease of the Furude couple in the third year, and the drug addict murderer in the fourth year were all cooked up. It'd mean someone who has a lot of power and influence over the police was involved.`
`When I pointed that out, Miyo-san nodded in agreement, and she started talking about how strongly "they" were rooted in the village and how deeply "they" were involved with many public organizations.`
`After she finished explaining all that, I finally noticed that Miyo-san was suggesting that the Three Families, including the Sonozaki family, were the masterminds behind the murder incidents.`
`In fact... the Sonozaki family really is very powerful.`
`They hold influence not only over Hinamizawa and Okinomiya, but also over the entire Shishibone area.`
`It might not be wrong to say that they even hold influence over the entire prefecture.`
`If the Sonozaki family is behind all of this... her theory would be more realistic.`
`But... that means I should be suspicious of Mii-chan.`
` ...No, I shouldn't.`
` ...But in fact, Mii-chan was very cold and unkind to Satoshi-kun when he was going through a tough time. `
`...I know there was conflict between the Sonozaki family and the Houjou family during the dam wars... but still, she was very cold to Satoshi-kun.`
`But Mii-chan admitted that what she did was wrong.`
`And I forgave her, too.`
`I didn't want to think about that again...`
`I decided to change the subject because I knew it'd make me feel uncomfortable if we kept talking about the Sonozaki family.`
`"First of all, what is the people's belief in Oyashiro-sama all about...?`
` It's a little funny that demons and humans wanted to coexist.`
` In folk tales, humans usually try to wipe out the demons."`
`"That's quite true.`
` That's why Oyashiro-sama is so interesting.`
` However, there are actually many stories that say people in old days worshipped a god that had drifted to our world from the land of the gods.`
`It's the worship of 'drifted gods,' in other words.`
` There are a number of myths all over the world about people worshipping a god who came from beyond the sea or from up a river."`
`"...The gods in those myths are actually people who came from different countries, right?"`
`"That's the general theory, yes.`
` Ancient Japanese culture was far behind that of other nations. `
`When Japanese people in those days saw a foreigner from a developed country, they were so impressed by the knowledge the person had that they started worshipping them as a god. That's one theory."`
`"I've heard that red oni and blue oni were actually foreigners who drifted ashore in Japan because their boats got shipwrecked. `
`The Japanese may have created tengu out of foreigners, too. They probably saw a foreigner who had a reddish skin with a very long nose."`
`"Wow, you're pretty sharp, Rena-chan.`
` I agree with you.`
` I think most drifted god worship are based on encounters with foreigners.`
`But if that's so, Onigafuchi's drifted god worship would have a contradiction. `
`...Do you know what it is?"`
`"...No, I don't."`
`"It's easy.`
` Onigafuchi isn't adjacent to the sea."`
`"Oh... of course."`
`"In order to have any connection to foreigners, the place in question must also have a connection to the outside world.`
` In Western countries, that connection would be rivers running between adjacent countries. `
`In Japan, that connection would be the ocean.`
` So, most of the drifted god stories in Japan originated near the shores."`
`"Isn't there a possibility that the foreigner washed ashore somewhere else first and then traveled to Onigafuchi?"`
`"Well, the thing about the worship of Oyashiro-sama is...`
` it specifically pinpoints Onigafuchi Swamp as the place where demons first appeared.`
` The swamp isn't connected to any rivers. `
`So, how could a foreigner wash up there?`
` ...That's why the mystery of Oyashiro-sama is so interesting."`
`".................."`
`"How much do you know about the legend of Oyashiro-sama?"`
`"I just read a picture book about it in school."`
`I feel like I know a lot about it, but I actually don't.`
`...I just have an extreme fear of the rule not to leave Hinamizawa.`
`...After all, my life went wrong after I left...`
`...I felt dizzy when I tried to think about it further, so I stopped.`
`When everything went wrong in Ibaraki... I met Oyashiro-sama, and he told me to go back to Hinamizawa......`
` No, no, no...`
` I'll get dizzy...`
` Don't try to remember.`
` Don't try to remember!`
` I can't remember.`
` I can't remember...`
`I got desperate because I felt responsible for the divorce.`
` I just used Oyashiro-sama as an excuse for my mental instability, and I told my father I wanted to go back to Hinamizawa... right?`
` But, wait... `
`Oyashiro-sama did come to me...`
` Oh, no. The colors are too dazzling.`
` ...I can only remember the vivid color of the pills and the dizziness...!`
`"That's all you need to know.`
` ...The demons came out of Onigafuchi Swamp, and they attacked the villagers.`
`Oyashiro-sama saw it and came down to save the villagers from the demons by exiling them to Hell.`
` The demons cried, and the villagers felt bad for them.`
` They decided to let the demons live in the village with them.`
`Oyashiro-sama was impressed by the kind hearts of the villagers, so he gave human forms to the demons, and let them coexist. `
`The blood of the demons blended with that of the villagers as they lived alongside each other."`
`"...That's exactly what I read in the book."`
`I felt dizzy, like I was going to faint, because I touched the one memory I didn't want to.`
`"People say that most myths are based on an event of some sort that happened long ago.`
` ...What event do you think is the truth behind this myth?"`
`Because I was still feeling dizzy, all I could do was tilt my head quizzically.`
`It seemed like Miyo-san was expecting that response, because she smiled, looking satisfied that she successfully made me confused.`
`She took a scrapbook out of her paper bag.`
`"I'll let you borrow this for a while."`
`"...Th-Thank you.`
` ...But I..."`
`"Don't worry. Just read it whenever you have some time to kill.`
` I want to know what you think about the things written in this scrapbook. `
`I'd like to know, even if you disagree with me, because you really are very sharp.`
` ...Jirou-san isn't interested in things like this at all, so I appreciate your input."`
`I had little choice but to take the scrapbook.`
`...Apparently Miyo-san came to the library often, so I figured I could return it to her whenever I came to return my books.`
`However, the day I'd return the scrapbook to Miyo-san never came...`
`"What's wrong?`
` You don't look good.`
` Are you feeling okay?"`
`"Ah... I caught a summer cold.`
` ...I'm still recovering from it."`
`It wasn't the summer cold that was making me feel dizzy.`
`...I always get dizzy when I try to remember the time I met Oyashiro-sama in Ibaraki.`
`I... mustered all my courage, and asked her.`
`...My memory of those days in Ibaraki is blurry.`
`...I know I met Oyashiro-sama.`
`Nobody believed me, and they told me that it was a hallucination.`
`But I thought Miyo-san would listen to me.`
`"Miyo-san.`
` ...Umm... Can I talk to you about something?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` You listened to me, so it's my turn to listen to you."`
`"Well... it's about Oyashiro-sama.`
` ...Umm... You... might laugh at me..."`
`"I won't.`
` You didn't laugh at me, either."`
`Miyo-san said it in a very gentle and mature way, and that encouraged me.`
`Even so, I still hesitated to talk... But there was probably nobody but Miyo-san with whom I could talk about something like this.`
`I gathered my courage again and spoke.`
`"I`
`............`
` have met...`
` Oyashiro-sama."`
`"......You have?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I used to live in Hinamizawa until right before I went to elementary school.`
` But my mother got a job in Ibaraki, so we moved.`
` ...Well, you know what that means, right?"`
`"Yes, I do.`
` ...You broke the rule of Oyashiro-sama, which is to never leave Hinamizawa."`
`"That's right.`
` And then... many things happened. My mother divorced my father... and my family was broken.`
` I got desperate and did some bad things."`
`"......It must have been terrible.`
` ......Then what happened?"`
`"I started hating everything in this world, and I started to feel like everybody who was happy was looking down on me.`
` ...That's when a mysterious existence started to appear."`
`"You mean... Oyashiro-sama?"`
`"The first time it came to me was...... Ummm, please don't tell anybody about this.`
` ...It was when I started injuring myself... by cutting my body with a knife. `
`...I cut my neck... and something very dirty and gross came out with the blood from the wound.`
` It was............ umm........."`
`"...I'm not going to laugh.`
` Go on."`
`The chill I felt at that time came back to me.`
`I sealed that memory away, so that I wouldn't have to remember ever again.`
`...But once I unsealed it, I started remembering things one after another.`
`Yes, back then, there was something in the blood... something crawling.`
`"It was countless... dark red maggots...!`
` They squirmed up and out from my neck with each drop of blood.`
` But they wanted to stay in my body, so they crawled back in through the cut!! `
`...I didn't want those creepy things to get back inside my body... so I clawed at the cut on my neck to get them out.`
` But it hurt so much, and it only made my hands and neck bloody...`
`I got scared all of a sudden.`
` I was scared because I thought there were that many nasty maggots in my blood vessels! `
`So... I cut a blood vessel on my thigh just to see how it looked. I thought I could see it better if it was my thigh.`
` Then...... they oozed out from there too!! So many of them!!!"`
`I understand, Ryuugu-san. So, please calm down...`
`"No, you don't understand!`
` The maggots come out with my blood, but then they try to get back inside my veins!!`
` It really, really itches!!`
` Aaaahhhh!!"`
`Please bring a doctor!`
` No, no, no. Don't claw at it like that!!`
` Bring me a sedative!`
` Hurry!!`
` Hold her down!`
`"Please kill the maggots in my veins!!!`
` Please take all the blood out of my body and flush my veins out!!`
` There are so many of them in there!!`
` Why don't you believe me?!`
` I'll show you! `
`You'll believe me if you see them, right?!`
` I don't want to get any more shots! No, no, no, no, no!!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` ...Okay?"`
`Miyo-san sat next to me and held my hands tightly.`
` ...Her touch brought me back to reality.`
`".........So ...what happened?"`
`"Nobody believed me... but then, he showed up.`
` ...Oyashiro-sama came to me."`
`...The memory was very vague, and I saw flickering lights. It made it difficult for me to remember...`
`"I met Oyashiro-sama." .........That sentence is all I remembered.`
`The memory of actually meeting Oyashiro-sama... was unbelievably vague.`
`After I got out of the hospital, I continued being treated at home. I still felt something moving in my veins, so I wanted to cut my body to make the blood ooze out so that I could make sure that there were no maggots in there.`
`Usually, I was sleeping like the dead because of the strong pills I was taking.`
` ......But one day I forgot to take the pill... and my consciousness was very clear.`
`I felt the maggots moving in my veins, and I felt the urge to look inside.`
`I cut a vein on my wrist...`
`I knew it... A lot of blood and many dusky-red maggots came out from the wound...!!`
`I wanted to wash them off before they crawled back inside me. So, I put my wrist under running water in the bathroom sink, and I tried to open the vein.`
`Water, blood, and maggots ran down into the drain.`
`...Just like squeezing out the pus from a pimple... I squeezed the vein to get rid of the dirty blood and the maggots.`
`I kept doing it...!!`
`My arm started to feel numb, and I felt cold. But I kept doing it!!`
`...I thought I might die from losing too much blood... But I kept doing it!!`
`My body was filled with maggots. I had to squeeze all my blood out of me!!`
`And then... a very bright light shone upon me.`
`It was a very bizarre sensation. I had never experienced anything like it in my life.`
`All of a sudden, the dark bathroom was filled with a bright light.`
`...It was very bright but gentle. It wasn't like the light from the merciless fluorescent bulb.`
` ...It was very warm and gentle.`
`That was... Oyashiro-sama.`
`Oyashiro-sama was looking at me with gentleness and sadness in his eyes.`
`As he touched my wound... the maggots started melting and disappeared in front of my eyes.`
`That wasn't all. All the maggots that were moving throughout all my veins disappeared, too...!`
`Oyashiro-sama taught me.`
`...These maggots were the curse.`
`People of the demon's blood can't live outside of Hinamizawa.`
`It's the rule.`
`Unfortunately, you've been cursed.`
`...It's very sad, and I feel sorry for you.`
` There is only one way to save you. ...That's what he said.`
`What should I do?!`
`The answer was very simple.`
`All I needed to do was to go back to Hinamizawa.`
`I unconsciously knew that before I heard it from Oyashiro-sama.`
`People who were born in Hinamizawa must never leave.`
`But I broke Oyashiro-sama's rules, and I left Hinamizawa... That's why my family was broken, and I lost my mind...!`
`If I hadn't left Hinamizawa, nothing would've gone wrong!`
`And so, I had to go back...!`
`Oyashiro-sama also told me this:`
`He could make the maggots, the embodiment of the curse, disappear. But only temporarily, because I lived far from Hinamizawa.`
`After a while, the power of Oyashiro-sama would fade away, and the curse would start eating my body again.`
`...If that happened, the maggots would take over my body, and I would go insane and die...`
`I must go back to Hinamizawa... before his power to hold down the curse faded away.`
`That's what Oyashiro-sama told me.`
`He did. I heard him tell me that!`
`I should've gone back to Hinamizawa earlier.`
` That's why Oyashiro-sama came to me to put his curse on me...!!`
` But he gave me a chance.`
` He gave me a chance to pay for my sin of leaving Hinamizawa!! `
`Dad, listen. Oyashiro-sama is going to help us.`
` Let's go back to Hinamizawa. Hinamizawa is the place where we must live.`
` If we don't, not only me, but you might be cursed, too!! `
`Let's go back to Hinamizawa. That's the only place where we can live!`
`We need to hurry!`
` We need to hurry... or Oyashiro-sama's power will fade away, and my body will be eaten by the maggots...!!`
` Oh, no. Oyashiro-sama is following me. He's telling me to hurry! `
`He follows me everywhere and keeps telling me to hurry!`
` He keeps apologizing to me for putting his curse on me.`
` He follows me everywhere and keeps apologizing!!`
` I'm telling you the truth!`
` I am!! `
`Why can't anybody see it?!`
` Why can't they see the maggots or Oyashiro-sama? `
`Everybody is trying to fool me. I know they can see them, too. No, no. Please stop. I don't want to get another shot...!!!`
` Aaaaaaaahhhh...`
`"............Are you okay...?"`
`...I was breathing hard, and Miyo-san was holding my shoulders.`
`...I could feel that the terrible memory I'd been trying to forget was awakening.`
`The doctors told me that the memory was just my delusion.`
`...They told me that since I blamed myself for the divorce, I unconsciously had a desire to blame someone else for it. And I unconsciously connected the desire to the folk tale of Oyashiro-sama that I read when I was little.`
`I got drug treatment, received counseling... and waited.`
`I gradually got better... and that proved the things I saw were just a hallucination.`
`The doctors asked my father to consider moving to Hinamizawa if possible.`
`Fortunately, he wanted to change his living environment to heal his pain from the divorce as well.`
`So... we came back to Hinamizawa.`
`After we came back to Hinamizawa... I felt it.`
`I felt it in my bones that this was the place we should live.`
`And I also felt`
` ...Oyashiro-sama's blessing.`
` I definitely felt it.`
` I felt the curse of Oyashiro-sama starting to break.`
` I was... free......!!`
`After I moved here, I went to the clinic in Gogura for a while.`
`The doctor gave me the same poisonous-looking pills, and I kept taking them for a while.`
`The terrible memory gradually became unclear...`
` Whenever I tried to remember it, I could only remember the strong side effect of the pills, and it made me dizzy...... That's how I regained my peace.`
`And then, I changed my name, Reina.`
`The reason was because my name reminded me of those bad memories.`
`I didn't want to have anything icky in my life anymore... That's why I came up with the idea of taking 'icky' things out.`
`After I took the "i" of icky out from my name, Reina, there were only "Re" and "na" left.`
`That's how Rena was born.`
` ...I liked that.`
`When I was introduced to my classmates, I told them to call me Rena.`
`Since then, that had been my name.`
`I'm living my new life as Rena.`
`I cut away all the sad things that happened when I was Reina.`
`My father still calls me Reina, but I don't feel bad as long as it was just my father and my relatives.`
`But then, Rina came into my life one day, and she called me Reina...`
`Because she called me Reina... those colored lights started flickering again...`
` I should stop. I should forget about it...`
` The lights were still flickering...`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` ...Was I panicking that badly...?"`
`"You were muttering to yourself.`
`I'm glad you calmed down."`
`Judging by Miyo-san's reaction... I wasn't panicking as badly as I thought I was.`
`But... I've probably had those panicked hallucinations several times.`
`...If I started screaming and yelling like I once did... they'd take me away to a hospital again for sure.`
`"I'm... certain I met Oyashiro-sama.`
` I saw the maggots.`
` ...Ahahahaha. It's hard to believe, right?"`
`"..............."`
`Miyo-san smiled, looking a little confused.`
`...I couldn't blame her. I didn't expect her to believe it.`
`...I'm sure it was just a strange memory I created for myself in my hallucinations.`
` ...I can't believe I can't trust myself.`
` ...That's the worst feeling of all.`
`"Rena-chan,`
` first of all, you don't have to worry about anything."`
`".........Yes."`
`"I'm talking about the curse you're afraid of`
` and the maggots that you saw in your blood.`
` According to what Oyashiro-sama said, you're free from them as long as you stay in Hinamizawa, right?"`
`"......Yes, that's what he said..."`
`"Then, you don't have to be scared.`
` You don't have to worry about anything.`
` You're in Hinamizawa right now. `
`Well, this library is in Okinomiya, but it's very close to Hinamizawa. I'm sure it's okay with Oyashiro-sama.`
` You don't feel anything moving in your veins right now, do you?"`
`".........No, I don't."`
`"So, there's nothing to worry about.`
` You're following Oyashiro-sama's rules.`
` There's nothing you should be scared of.`
` Is there?`
` Right?"`
`"............No.`
` ......No."`
`I didn't know until then that she was such a warm-hearted person.`
`I met many doctors and talked to them about this, but they always ignored me, and didn't really listen. All they did was give me a shot of the drug I hated.`
`...On the other hand, Miyo-san didn't deny my story or the existence of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The people in this village whispered behind her back that she's a little crazy...`
` But she was actually a very kind person,`
` I thought.`
`"Rena-chan,`
` I believe everything you just told me."`
`"...Thank you so much.`
` You're the first one to ever say that to me..."`
`"Hee hee, so are you.`
` You're the first one who didn't laugh at me and listened to me so seriously.`
` ......I think we can be good friends."`
`Miyo-san smiled, touching my head with hers.`
`"Well... I'll let you borrow my secret files and my scrapbooks.`
`These are top secret.`
` I didn't want to show these to anybody, but you're special. I think I can trust you.`
` ...I know you'll take them seriously."`
`She took a few scrapbooks out of her paper bag, and handed them to me.`
`"Let me know what you think after you read them.`
` ...There might be... there might be something in them that only you can understand."`
`Miyo-san was acting mysteriously.`
`She smiled mischievously, and put her index finger on her lips as a sign to keep it a secret.`
`"Don't tell anybody about these scrapbooks, or that I'm studying this... okay?"`
`"We're keeping this a secret?`
` Okay, I got it."`
`"...If they find out that I've been studying this, they might get rid of me.`
` ...Hee hee hee hee."`
`She laughed after she said that.`
`They might erase her.`
`That's what she said.`
`And... she went missing...`
`...She left me her scrapbooks.`
`But that's not all there is to it.`
`It's the... way Tomitake-san died.`
`Ooishi-san said he committed suicide because of a state of excitation caused by using some kind of drug... But I know what really happened.`
`......I didn't tell Ooishi-san about it.`
` ...I don't think he'd have believed me even if I told him.`
`Without a doubt......`
` Tomitake-san... died trying to get rid of the maggots.`
`It was nothing other than the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`To never leave Hinamizawa isn't the only rule of Oyashiro-sama.`
`There are more.`
` ...He might've broken one of them without knowing it.`
`Ooishi-san told me.`
`...Tomitake-san was taking pictures with his camera flash on during the sacred ritual dance, and some people got mad at him for it...`
`Did Oyashiro-sama put his curse on Tomitake because he violated the sacred ritual dance...?`
`It might be for another reason... Anyway... he died from the curse of Oyashiro-sama, without a doubt.`
`Did that mean... Oyashiro-sama put his curse on Miyo-san, too...?`
`Investigating the gods is the same as getting close to the gods.`
` It's disrespecting them.`
`But... Miyo-san told me that "they" might get rid of her if they found out about her investigation.`
`By "they" she meant humans.`
`...Plus, according to her theory, the Three Families are in a conspiracy to revive the faith of Oyashiro-sama.`
`But I can tell by the way Tomitake-san died that it was the act of the curse!`
`I'm certain about that because I experienced the curse myself!`
`And at first glance, that seemed incompatible with those conspiracy theories about human beings.`
`I remember that Ooishi-san told me something about some kind of drug that can make a person commit suicide.`
`...So do the Three Families have a secret drug that can cause the curse of Oyashiro-sama...?`
`That's impossible. Plus, I didn't get any shots of a suspicious drug like that.`
`I had a normal life in Ibaraki.`
`I wasn't involved with the Sonozaki family or the Kimiyoshi family...`
`Ooishi-san asked me a favor.`
`He asked me to tell him secretly if I saw or heard anything suspicious.`
`It could be about Mii-chan, Rika-chan, or anybody in the village.`
`Miyo-san believed my story about Oyashiro-sama. Now she's gone.`
`Tomitake-san died by doing the same thing I did.`
`Oh, no, no, no, no...`
`I don't want to get involved with the curse of Oyashiro-sama...!`
`Is this a conspiracy of a group of fanatical cult members, or is it the curse of Oyashiro-sama?`
`Is everything just a set of coincidences...? Or maybe it's a mixture of a conspiracy and the curse...`
`I don't know!`
` Is it the work of humans, the curse, or a coincidence?`
`Oh, no... even the light of the sunset was making me feel dizzy.`
`When did the sunlight in Hinamizawa get so mean...?`
`Miyo-san told me to keep her investigation secret.`
`...I have her top-secret scrapbooks.`
`...They... might hold the truth about everything.`
`When I realized that, I got scared all of a sudden.`
`I might end up the same way as Miyo-san, because I have her scrapbooks.`
`If it's a conspiracy, I'll be erased.`
`If it's the curse, I'll be cursed.`
`I should burn the scrapbooks... That's the safest thing to do...`
`...But Miyo-san believed my story.`
`Miyo-san listened to me without laughing.`
`...It'd feel wrong to burn them without taking a look.`
`If it's a conspiracy, I have to expose it.`
`If it's the curse, I have to break it.`
`I shouldn't run away.`
` ...I should fight.`
`That's right, I decided to fight to seize my happiness.`
`I shouldn't give in to misfortunes.`
` I have to fight!`
`...I'm going to get rid of all the things that are trying to ruin my peaceful life...!`
`I'm going to read her scrapbooks when I get home.`
`I started walking faster...`
