`Satoko went to join the children playing in the schoolyard.`
`Since I didn't feel like going, I decided to stay at home.`
`...Most likely, she wouldn't be back until the evening.`
`When Satoko wasn't around... I had ways of spending time without her.`
`Besides, that was what I wanted to do anyway.`
`I stuck my hand deep inside the pile of winter futons in the closet, and pulled one out.`
`Next, I filled a stylish-looking glass with ice.`
`The ice made in the freezer smelled of chlorine, though, and didn't taste good.`
`Store-bought ice would be the best. But since Satoko kept asking me what I was using it for, I stopped buying it.`
`...But it might be worth spending time to think about a good excuse for that if it meant I would be able to enjoy ice without ever again smelling the chlorine.`
`I filled the glass with mineral water...... and then poured a little bit of another liquid into the glass.`
`Watching the color mix into the transparent water was a very pleasant thing.`
`This wasn't the right way to drink it, but I liked it that way, and didn't want to hear any complaints.`
`My body is very convenient, because I can get drunk with only a tiny amount.`
`That's why I dilute that small amount with a full glass of water.`
`And thanks to that, I could enjoy a single bottle for a long time. It wasn't bad, if you thought about it like that.`
`I put a cushion on my favorite spot by the window... and with the glass in one hand, I enjoyed the familiar view and the soft wind brushing through my hair.`
`A slightly sweet ripened aroma tickled my nose.`
`......And just when I was about to start enjoying the atmosphere, the annoying one came back.`
`She didn't like this bad habit of mine, and she complained every time I tilted the glass.`
`She started nagging me noisily.`
`"Shut up.`
` Be a little more tolerant. I can drink and eat whatever I want."`
`"Y-You can't...!`
` Kids aren't supposed to drink alcohol!"`
`I tried to ignore her, but she started making a fuss, as if trying to ruin the atmosphere on purpose.`
`...There was no way I could enjoy getting drunk like this.`
`I glared at her, and threw the drink out the window.`
`"...Do you want to know why I'm depressed?`
` ...I'm depressed because the way I die has been decided."`
`It seemed like she finally understood why I wanted to drown myself in alcohol.`
`"You don't have to feel down.`
` I get to die instantly, so it's not that scary."`
`My body will be burned and cut in pieces, but I'll be able to die instantly.`
`"...But... not yet."`
`"I know.`
` ......Not yet.`
` ...When am I going to die again?"`
`".........I think it's the night of the 25th of June."`
`"It's about a week after the Watanagashi festival.`
` ...Well, that sounds reasonable."`
`"Is it......... my fault?"`
`"Of course it is.`
` Are you serious?"`
`"...Au au au..."`
`She was the one who asked me, yet she cried when I told her she was right.`
` ...Ah, geez! She's always so annoying.`
`"Let's keep trying.`
` ...I'm sure I'll get six in a row on the next board game."`
`June 25th.`
`...I still had ten more days.`
` ...I was going to relax and enjoy those ten days.`
`I still had some wine left, too...`
