`"Keiichi-san!!!`
` I know now, I figured it out!!!"`
`I heard Satoko screaming from the classroom.`
`Satoko had figured out where Rena hid the time bomb!!`
`I wanted to catch Rena, but I didn't have time for that.`
`I had to do something about the time bomb instead!!`
`"Keiichi!`
` Hurry up and go back to Satoko!"`
`Rika-chan had spread her arms, blocking Rena's path forward.`
`"What are you doing? Just run!!!"`
`".........Keiichi.`
` This isn't the first time I've done this for you.`
` Don't you remember?"`
`"............Eh?"`
`"If I'd tried a little harder the previous time... you could have made it.`
`...So this time, you are going to make it!`
` Just go!!"`
`I didn't know what Rika-chan was talking about.`
`But there was one thing I did know.`
`Just like Rena and Mion were ready to give up their lives for their friends, and I was willing to give up mine...`
` Rika-chan was prepared for that too!!`
`Therefore, telling Rika-chan to run was like telling her she wasn't my friend!!`
`And so, I will depend on my friend, Rika-chan!!`
`"Thank you, Rika-chan!!!"`
`"Keiichi-san, we are running out of tiiiiiime!!!"`
`Leaving it to Rika-chan, I dashed for the classroom!!`
`As soon as Rika heard Keiichi's footsteps reach the classroom door, she sighed in relief.`
`As she did, Rena's black shadow came ever closer.`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` That's great, that's just great; this isn't a club activity, you know?`
` You'll be killed for real!! You'll be killed by an angry Rena!!"`
`"....................."`
`"Ahahahahahahahahaha...ha ha...`
` Hmm...`
` You're not afraid of me, are you?`
` You're amazing, Rika-chan."`
`Rika grabbed a mop as she ran from the storage closet. She picked it up and held it upside down, like a spear.`
`Rika's stance told Rena that she was ready to fight.`
`Rika didn't look like a little girl anymore.`
`She looked so brave...`
` that Rena was even startled by it.`
`".........Boy, you really are amazing.`
` You aren't afraid of being killed at all, huh?"`
`"...Heh!"`
`Rika smiled cynically.`
`Rika usually never smiled this way.`
`"Do you really think I would be afraid of death?`
` I've experienced several hundred deaths up until now. Why should I be afraid of it all of a sudden?"`
`"You... aren't Rika-chan, are you?`
` ...You're the one I met that night...`
` Show yourself, alien...!`
` Where is the real Rika-chan?"`
`"The real Rika?`
` She's right here.`
` ...Meep, nipahâ˜†."`
`"Ah!!`
` The way you're looking down on me, that really is like Rika-chan!`
` ...I get it, Oyashiro-sama is an alien.`
` The Furude family is descended from him...  and therefore you are a descendant of aliens!! `
`Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I'll crack open your head and drag out all the parasites in your brain, ahhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`Rena raised her hatchet and charged at Rika with a scream!!`
`"Hyaaaahhhh!!`
` One swing is all I need to smash your head open!!!!"`
`Rena looked like a beast charging towards its prey!!!`
`Rika took a step backwards and lowered her body, preparing to counterattack.`
`She did that with no hesitation...`
`"Even a minute is plenty.`
` I'll play with you.`
` Come on, hatchet girl!"`
`"Do you not get it, Keiichi-san?`
` All the hints were already in place this morning!"`
`"C-Calm down, Satoko!`
` Explain more slowly so I can understand!`
` What are you trying to say?"`
`It's simple if you just remember...!`
` Come on, it's quite obvious when you do!`
`"Hey, something stinks today. Close the windows!"`
`"Silly, it'll be hotter in here if we close the windows!!"`
`We had been smelling gasoline coming from outdoors.`
`There were no forestry service people in the office, so they weren't doing any work today.`
` The smell wasn't coming from anything they were doing.`
`In other words, it was the smell of Rena's gasoline.`
`Rena hid the gasoline near the classroom. She had it in a plastic container.`
`You can't smell gasoline that's in a plastic container...`
`So in other words, she had more gasoline ready than just in the container she used to spread it around the classroom.`
`Where was the smell coming from?`
` ...Was it coming from outside?`
`Vaporized gasoline is heavier than air.`
`It sinks.`
`There was another hint other than that.`
`"What?!`
` Our ball is missing!`
` You hid it again, didn't you, Houjou?"`
`"Why would I hide such a stupid thing?`
` If I was going to hide something, I'd hide something better than that."`
`Kids who love to play with their ball never lose it!`
`It should have been in the same place it always was.`
`But it was gone!`
`So that must mean that Rena used it for something!`
`The gasoline was`
` coming from above.`
` A ball was missing...`
` So maybe, it was stuffed somewhere...`
`"Rena-san blocked the drain with the ball and poured gasoline in the drain canal!!`
` Where?`
` On the roof of the second floor!!"`
`The drain canal extended along the roof of the second floor and then came straight down to the ground.`
`If it was plugged and filled with gasoline... it was like a huge Molotov cocktail that extended from the ground to the roof of the second floor!!`
`Furthermore, the drain canal ran by the classroom windows!!`
`If the canal exploded, the classroom would explode too!!`
`"Therefore!!`
` The time bomb must be...!!"`
`"I bet she ran an extension cord out the second floor window... It's on the rooftop!!!"`
`I picked up a pair of scissors and cut Satoko's bonds.`
`"By the way, how did Rika-chan free herself from the rope?"`
`"I apologize for not being thin enough to slip out myself."`
`I rubbed Satoko's head.`
`"Take care of the rest here!`
` I'm going up to the roof!!"`
`As I jumped out of the classroom, Satoko stopped me.`
`"Keiichi-san, here!!"`
`"What is it?"`
`Something silver sailed through the air!`
`I caught it.`
` It was a metal bat...!`
`"...That's Nii-nii's.`
`Make sure you give it back to me, okay?"`
`"Sure thing!!`
` Thanks, Satoko!!!"`
`The metal bat fit right in my palm. I didn't even feel its weight.`
` It really eased my mind!!`
`The name "Satoshi" was written on the handle.`
`This was the bat that belonged to Satoko's brother, Satoshi.`
`He was the victim of last year's tragedy.`
`You and I, we're the same.`
`I won't let another tragedy take place!`
`I'll treat this as a gift from you, who was waiting in the wings!`
`Let's rip apart the script of this demonic tragedy together!!`
` Let's go, Satoshi!!!`
`As I tried to run up the stairs, I heard a loud noise coming from the hallway by the teacher's office.`
`I saw Rika-chan rolling on the floor.`
`......Damn... Rika-chan!!`
` You held out as long as you could!!`
`"......Damn it.`
` If my body were five years older..."`
`"You're next, Keiichi-kun!!!`
` Whooooaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Shit!! I have to go.`
` I have to get to the rooftop!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahaha, how did you figure it out, how did you?!!`
` Still, I won't let you get up there!!!"`
`Rena's face looked unbelievably scary!`
`She was ready to rip me apart if she caught me.`
` In that case, just try me!!`
`I jumped up the stairs, skipping every other step!`
`I turned on the bug in my pocket.`
` I didn't have time to put in the earphones!`
`As Rena flew up the stairs,`
` her foot got caught on a jump rope.`
`She tripped, and then three buckets fell on her head.`
` ...The result of Satoko's trap!!`
`"Ow... ow ow ow ow...!!`
` Tch... Ahahahahahahahahaha, it was Satoko-chan, huh?!!"`
`Satoko leaned against the wall and waved her index finger in a mocking gesture.`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
`You were pretty good, but you are about three hundred million light years too early to go up against a trap expert like me!!!"`
`"...Satoko-chan, light years are a unit of distance, not time..."`
`Smash!`
`The fourth bucket hit Satoko on the head.`
`I continued up to the rooftop!!`
`Rena ignored Satoko and ran after me...!`
`"O, O!`
` Ooishi-san?`
` I did it!!!`
` I got the lighter.`
` I know where the time bomb is; it's on the rooftop in the drain canal!!`
` I'm headed up there right now!!"`
`"...Ooishi-san... is that it?"`
`Ooishi grabbed the pair of binoculars from Kumagai and looked at the rain gutter on the rooftop.`
`......There was something like an alarm clock sitting there!`
`The cord from the clock was extending into the second floor window.`
`It was so obvious, but they didn't even notice until just then!`
`Satoko was working hard to remove her classmates' restraints.`
`But she couldn't do anything about the bike lock on Mion's neck!`
`"Just run, everyone! Forget about me...!"`
`"Hmm, that doesn't sound like Mion-san.`
` Why not act like our club president, even in a situation like this?`
`All you have to do, as our president, is to give me an order to undo this lock, okay?"`
`Satoko reached for the back of her collar... and produced a bent hair pin.`
`Satoko opened the window, climbed onto the windowsill, and faced the bike lock that was restraining Mion.`
`"E-Everyone, open the curtains and the windows, then run!!"`
`"B-But, class prez!`
` What about Maebara-san?"`
`"The police will help Kei-chan!`
` You all need to run as soon as possible!!`
` ...Huh?`
` Did you unlock it already?"`
`"To me, this type of lock is child's play!"`
`The binoculars were trained on the classroom.`
`All the curtains were open, as well as all the windows. The children, in turn were all running out onto the schoolyard!`
`Ooishi pushed Ootaka aside, then grabbed his radio and yelled into it.`
`"All units, go!!`
` Go, go!!`
` Secure the hostages!!`
` The suspect is going up to the second floor, running after one of them!"`
`"Hey! What are you doing? Ooishi-kun, give me back the radio... Gyahh! Ah... guhhhhh."`
`Ootaka tried to grab the radio from Ooishi, but Kumagai stepped in.`
`There was a dull noise and Ootaka crumbled to the floor, convulsing.`
`"Oops, sorry.`
` I guess my knee happened to hit your balls."`
`"The classroom is still filled with gasoline, be very careful!`
` You are forbidden from using any gas bombs or flares. Again, do not use gas bombs or flares!!`
` The whole place will blow!!"`
`"Support unit to HQ!`
` We secured twenty-four hostages!!`
` One is injured!"`
`"This is the assault unit. We're trying to take control of the first floor.`
` ...We've got a problem.`
` The electrical room is locked, and we can't get in."`
`"You can't get in?!`
` Can't you break down the door?"`
`"It's located directly opposite the classroom.`
` The smell of gasoline is strong here. We might ignite the gas when breaking down the door.`
` We'll await further orders."`
`"Shit!!`
` We could have just turned the power off!`
` ...Forget the electrical room, go secure the second floor!!"`
`"Assault unit, roger that.`
` Alpha, GO! GO! GO!!!"`
`"Ootaka-kun!`
` What were you going to do if you failed to secure the electrical room?"`
`"That is... That's what the special unit was for..."`
`"This is the problem with rich boys...`
` We'll just have to secure the clock's outlet now!"`
`"Sniper unit to HQ.`
` I can see a male hostage on the rooftop of the first floor."`
`"Ooishi-san!!`
` That's Maebara-kun!!"`
`"Give me the speaker!!`
` Maebara-san!!!`
` The clock is plugged into the back room on the second floor!!"`
`I shook my head repeatedly.`
`I couldn't do that.`
`Rena was coming after me, so I couldn't head that way.`
`What else could I do?`
`The only way was to go up to the roof of the second floor and get the clock from there!!`
`"Maebara-saaaan!!`
` Continue up to the roof of the second floor!!!`
` I'll direct you from there!!"`
`Ooishi-san was telling me to go further up.`
`Satoko only told me that it was on the rooftop of the second floor, and she didn't tell me where exactly.`
`She only said it was in the drain canal.`
`But maybe Ooishi-san found it with his binoculars.`
`I put my foot on the railing of the veranda and ran up to the rooftop.`
`I had never felt so light.`
`I felt like I could lift myself with just two or three fingers.`
`"That's it, keep going!!!`
` It's at the furthest end of the drain pipe!!!`
` You only have thirty seconds!!!"`
`Heh!`
` Thirty seconds would be plenty of time!!`
` I could get there in half that!!`
`Over there... Was that it?`
` It waaaaaaas!!!`
`"Sniper unit to HQ.`
` I can see the suspect on the rooftop of the first floor!"`
`"Ahh, I wish you could fire, but you're using live ammo, aren't you?`
` It's not tear gas or anything, is it?"`
`"No, it's live ammunition."`
`"Use those in the military! Japanese police don't need anything like that...!`
` Maebara-san!!`
` She's after you!!`
` Hurry!!`
` She'll be there soon!!!"`
`How many more seconds did I have?`
` Ah, who cares? Whooaaahhhhh!!!`
`I slid down the roof and grabbed the kitchen timer that was sitting on the drain pipe, which was filled with gasoline.`
`There was a cord with a copper wire attached to it.`
`This was supposed to create sparks and start an explosion!`
`The hands on the clock kept moving, with the second hand trying to reach the minute hand...`
` Seven,`
` six,`
` five,`
` four,`
` three, `
`Whoooaaaaaoooooooohhh!!!!`
`I threw it to the ground!!`
`A moment later, I heard the noise of something breaking.`
`Hah... hah... hah!!`
` Did I do it?`
`"Assault unit to HQ, the time bomb has been stopped!"`
`"Yeeeeeeeees!!!"`
`"O-Ooishi-san, we did it, we did it!!"`
`"Yeah!`
` M-Maebara-san, good job!!"`
`"Keiichi-san certainly made me nervous.`
` Cutting it so close isn't elegant, you know!"`
`Not only policemen, but the children who were on their way to ambulances raised their voices in cheer.`
`"Ooishi-san, there's a message from the fire department.`
` The scene is still dangerous, so order all units to retreat immediately!!"`
`"Isn't the time bomb gone, though...?"`
`"Although the ignition device is gone, it's still extremely dangerous.`
` The lives of the assault unit might be at stake."`
`"Damn...!`
` What about Maebara-kun up there?`
` Can he jump off?"`
`"Ooishi-san, according to the map, there's a flower bed by the school building.`
` We'll tell him to jump there!!"`
`"Ooishi to all units!!`
` Stop the operation, fall back immediately, fall back!!"`
`"Alpha here, roger that."`
`"Beta here, roger that. Fall back, fall back!!"`
`"Can you hear me, Maebara-san?`
` Ryuugu-san too!!`
` It's too dangerous to stay there!!`
` It might explode at any minute!!`
` There's a flower bed by the school building; jump down there!!!"`
`"A flower bed?`
` Damn it, I can't see it from here..."`
`But it didn't sound like I had enough time to be looking for it.`
`......I noticed a white hand at the edge of the roof...`
` followed by Rena's head.`
`Rena slowly crawled up to the rooftop.`
`I waited for her there.`
`"I never thought you would find it.`
` It was all for nothing..."`
`Rena scratched at her throat.`
`The band-aids peeled off, and her throat started to bleed...`
`"It's game over,`
` Rena!!!"`
`We were confronting each other on the rooftop of the second floor.`
`...This wasn't a club activity, but a real battle!`
`Rena was glaring at me with hatred at first...`
`But maybe because she had already given up, she started smiling wickedly.`
`I heard the chorus of the higurashi in the background, as if to cool us down from the heat of battle.`
`I didn't think we needed their service yet, though.`
`"Yeah, if it was a board game, you'd have reached the goal and won.`
` But... this isn't a game.`
`So this isn't a goal--it's a dead end."`
`"......Shit, you don't give up, do you?`
` Rena, you really are strong.`
` You never give up.`
` You fight until the bitter end.`
` You keep believing until that point, too."`
`"Praise like that won't make me happy now...`
` You ruined everything that I had risked my life for, Keiichi-kun.`
`I was simply trying to protect our species from the aliens. You ruined it. `
`If humans go extinct... it'll be your fault, Keiichi-kun. That will be recorded in history!!!"`
`I didn't mean to laugh, but I couldn't help it...`
`My name would be written down in the history books of the aliens as the one who destroyed the human species. Somehow, that sounded kinda cool.`
`"Rena...`
` no matter what you have to say, I've won this game.`
` I've already won, and you just don't want to admit it. That's all."`
`"Yeah...... maybe you're right."`
`"But maybe that's not how it works.`
` A game doesn't end when there's a winner.`
` It ends when there's a loser.`
` That means... for me, winning isn't enough."`
`"............Hmm?`
` What do you mean?"`
`I tapped my shoulder with the metal bat, gesturing for Rena to come at me.`
`"I'm going to make you understand that you lost."`
`I won't run or hide.`
` Do you know why?`
`According to the rules of our club, we don't run from our enemies!!`
`"I'll prove to you`
` that you've already lost, Rena!!"`
`"..................Hmm."`
`"Are you ready?`
` Parasites and aliens?`
` How stupid!`
` Who would believe in things like that these days?`
` I can only laugh, ha ha ha har!!"`
`".........You never believed me in the first place`
` yet you pretended that you did.`
` .........How dare you deceive me!!`
` I won't forgive you...`
` I'll never forgive you!!"`
`"I don't care if you believe in those things.`
` But I would never believe in anything that stupid! `
`Well, if I did have to believe in anything like that, I'd rather believe in the buried treasures of the Tokugawa Shogunate!`
` But if you still want me to believe...`
` don't you remember our club's rules?"`
`"Whoever can seize victory is the correct one..."`
`"There you go!!"`
`Rena and I grinned at each other, and as we went around in circles on the rooftop, we both checked the distance between us.`
`"If you can take me down, I'll believe in your alien stories!!`
` I'll perform a mysterious dance every morning and night to call for UFOs to come and beam up livestock!!`
` But Rena... `
`If I take you down, then I want you to be ready!!"`
`"Ahhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` I don't think you even need to think further than that, I don't think you do!`
` You will never defeat me!!"`
`Rena came at me with a heavy strike!!`
`I caught it easily with the metal bat.`
`It looked like there were some sparks.`
` This was finally getting interesting!`
`"Hey, maybe you shouldn't say that yet. You might be wrong, you know.`
` When I went through a whole lot of fierce battles in our club, I learned something.`
` I learned about myself!`
`Now I know what I need... to bring out my ultimate power."`
`"Really?`
` I wonder what it is...`
`I wonder!!"`
`Rena, your hatchet can be a powerful weapon.`
`But my metal bat is as powerful as your hatchet.`
`Sure, it doesn't have a blade, but it reaches farther and it's easy to handle!`
`I won't be going for a defensive battle!`
`I'm going to fight you face to face, and I'm going to defeat you!!`
`I'm sure I'm stronger than you physically, but you're better at drawing out your true potential, Rena.`
`In other words, we're equally matched!!`
` This is great!`
` I won't need to hold back at all!`
`"So what are you going to do after you beat me?`
`Take that, that, and that!!!`
`Hmm, I think I might have the upper hand!"`
`"Huh!`
` I'm just warming up!`
` Just you wait and see!`
` Wait and see what I do after I take you down!`
` We've both put a lot of chips on the pile!`
`Prepare yourself for having to make a big payout!!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`Aren't you counting your chickens before they've hatched?`
`Your bluffing is just pathetic!"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` You don't get it, do you?`
`My strength increases in proportion to my reward, don't you know?`
`Let's see...!!`
`You'll be my personal maid!!`
`Starting from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night, you'll serve me all day, every day!`
`With Coach's help, you'll be wearing a different costume every day!!`
`Wait, until I go to sleep at night?`
`What if I make it so that you won't let me sleep instead?!`
`How 'bout that?"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Ahhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!`
`That's so like you, Keiichi-kun!`
`No, thank you! `
`Actually, I'll win, and make you my servant!!"`
`Ah ha ha ha ha!!`
`We both laughed like crazy people as we struck at each other!!`
`It was strange how much fun it was becoming.`
`Rena and I were trying to kill each other... and yet, it was a blast!`
`Sparks were flying. We could get seriously injured!!`
`If we fell off of the rooftop, we'd break our bones, yet this was so much fun!!`
`I had been mourning and crying all day today while Rena terrified me.`
`How did all that turn into this?`
`"The two of us can't be serious even if we try!`
`Even with sparks flying, we can only goof around!!"`
`"Too bad!`
`That's not me. I like being elegant and graceful.`
`You can have fun goofing around by yourself, Keiichi-kun!!"`
`Rena's next strike came at a strange angle, but I managed to deflect it!`
`"Whoa!!`
`Taahaha!!`
`That's too, too weak. You're done!"`
`"Ha ha!`
`Finally, I'm all warmed up.`
`This is just a warm-up, right?"`
`"Huh?`
`Stupid, this isn't even a warm-up.`
`This is like taking a walk.`
` Hey, you're all sweaty."`
`"Hee hee hee hee, ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!`
`Instead of sweat, you'll be covered in your own blood!!"`
`"Maebara-san!!`
` Jump off!!`
` Come on, jump!!!`
` He isn't even listening to us!`
` He's so into it that he can't even hear anything...!`
` ...Ooishi-san?"`
`".........Hmm?`
` Ah, ah, sorry!`
` What is it?"`
`"What do you mean 'what is it'?`
` We have to figure out a way to rescue him!"`
`Ooishi couldn't figure out why he was distracted, considering the seriousness of the situation.`
`He was engrossed in watching the two of them fight with the sunset behind them.`
`But Ooishi wasn't the only one.`
`Everyone watching was captivated by their battle on the rooftop.`
`At that moment, a sudden loud voice broke the silence.`
`"M-Maebara-san, hang in there!!!`
` Careful, don't fall!!"`
`The students who were about to climb onto the ambulance`
` were cheering him on.`
`Mion was being loaded onto a stretcher with bandages around her head, but even she sat up, captivated as she was by Rena and Keiichi's duel.`
`Our once-happy days were supposed to have shattered due to a series of misunderstandings. They were supposed to be irretrievable...`
`But...`
` huh......`
` ...why?`
`Why did I feel this way...?`
`This was such a close game.`
`But it wouldn't be fun to stay in a stalemate forever!!`
`Rena and I kicked at each other with perfect timing, and increased the distance between us!`
`"Hey!!!`
` This is a blast!!!`
`What do you think, Rena?`
`Isn't this just the best?"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
`I've been having fun since the very beginning!!`
`But it'll be even more fun to split your head open, Keiichi-kun!`
`Split it opeeen!!"`
`"Wow, that's dangerous!!`
` Over here!!`
`Come back over here!!`
` Let's use more space!!`
`Something like this doesn't happen too often!!`
` Let's enjoy it as much as we can!!"`
`"Ahhhahahahahahaha!!`
`This would make a great picture!`
`Look, there's a beautiful moon behind us!`
` The breeze feels great!!"`
`It was such a fantastical scene.`
`Two people were fighting on the rooftop of the school building, with the moon behind them. It was almost unbelievable.`
`All the policemen and children looked at that mysterious and fantastical scene from a distance, completely entranced.`
`Everyone was thinking the same thing,`
` but nobody said anything.`
`...Why does it look like they're having fun?`
`"Getting all fired up in a breeze this cool...`
`It reminds me of the Watanagashi festival!!`
`I don't really like to just sit back and enjoy the cool of the evening in silence!`
`When the moon comes up, I turn into an animal!!"`
`All us club members went crazy on the night of Watanagashi!`
`The mayor scolded us by the end of it, but we laughed at each other, and promised to do the same thing again next year!!`
`"Going crazy under the moon, huh? That sounds cool, doesn't it?`
`Maybe we're already crazy!!"`
`"Yeah, I feel the same!!`
`We're having fun trying to kill each other... we must be mad already!!`
` This must be what insanity is like!!"`
`Some people say the moon has the power to arouse passions in people.`
`Maybe that's true, and maybe it's not.`
`One thing that's for sure is that even if it were a new moon tonight,`
` we would still feel the same way!!!`
`As our surroundings got darker, the sparks we'd create with each hit started to look like fireflies.`
`Hey now, isn't there gasoline in the drain pipe right nearby?`
` Ahhhahahahahaha, who cares? If an explosion happens, it happens!!`
`"Hey, what are you doing?`
`Are you getting too sweaty to hold the bat?`
`Why don't you take a break and dry your hands off?`
` I'll split your head open while you do that, though!!"`
`"Wa ha ha ha!!`
` That's a good one!!`
`Isn't your skirt clinging to your legs? You can take it off if you want!!`
`I'll just watch you instead of attacking!!"`
`"Really?`
`Then I'll give you a good blow to the head while you're charmed by my legs!`
` Ahhahahahahaha!"`
`"This really is so much fun, isn't it, Rena?!!"`
`"Yep, it sure is!!!"`
`We flew! We danced!`
`We struck! We laughed!`
`We stepped back once in a while to catch a breath, and then charged at each other and let the sparks fly!`
`We aimed at each other as we went around in circles on the rooftop of the school, our special stage.`
`Rena and I were all sweaty.`
`But we weren't exhausted yet. The beads of sweat rolling down my body just tickled me.`
`We exchanged furious blows one after the other.`
`Neither of us was at an advantage or disadvantage.`
`Neither of us exalted in victory or raged in defeat.`
`The battle with Rena in itself was fun.`
`It was like a dance.`
`A dance I couldn't dance by myself.`
`It was a dance I could only dance with someone with whom I was equally matched.`
`"Didn't you think the same thing I did when we did that club activity with the whole class...?`
` The day we duelled with water guns..."`
`"Yeah, I did!!"`
`""We wanted to fight like this again!!!""`
`As we thought that way on the rooftop, our classmates down below must've thought the same.`
`Our fight was so pure and passionate... that everyone thought the same thing!`
`'We want to join them!!'`
`"It was the same back then!`
`We were using water guns, but we did the same thing!!!"`
`"But this is far more fun!!`
`I don't have to worry about how much water I have left in my gun!!"`
`"Yeah, we can't create sparks with water guns!"`
`"We couldn't strike at each other like this either!!!"`
`We both were breathing hard, waiting for the right timing to take a step forward.`
` In the midst of that, we grinned at each other.`
`"Huff... huff...!`
`This is exactly what I said then, but I'm going to say it again."`
`"Okay then, I'll respond just the same."`
`We both smiled wickedly in the same moment!!`
`"This is so fun!`
` I don't want it to ever end!!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Don't hate me if you lose!!"`
`"No, never!!`
` I'd hate myself for ending this game!!`
` But I know I won't be the one crying in the end!!"`
`"I don't know about that!`
` Your feet are getting weak, like they're made of straw!!"`
`"Shut uuuup!!`
`Whoaaaryaaahhhhh!!!"`
`Everyone was captivated by our fight.`
` They were swept up in our fight.`
`We both had weapons.`
`Weapons deadly enough to seriously hurt one another!`
`But we were both perfectly matched`
` and neither of us had hit the other yet!!`
`Why did they look so happy?`
` This was just ridiculous...!`
`All the people below were just watching this fight on the rooftop with the beautiful moon as a backdrop.`
` Not even the police could stop them!`
`This was impossible!!`
`This battle was absurd... and absolutely impossible!!`
`"Keiichi-san!!`
` Try to stay in the middle of the roof!!`
` Use the height to your advantage!!!"`
`Satoko and some of her classmates cheered Keiichi on, but there were some who were cheering for Rena too.`
`To them, this was no longer a fight to the death.`
`It was just the second round of their water gun battle.`
`A club activity is a club activity and a game is a game.`
`This was just the second round, so nobody would die.`
`Even though they had real weapons...`
`Nobody thought they would get hurt.`
`Rika wasn't cheering. She was just looking up at the rooftop.`
`"...I've...... never`
` seen anything...`
` like this before..."`
`Rika thought to herself.`
`She thought Keiichi could win.`
`Not just against Rena.`
`Rika thought Keiichi could even destroy the walls of the maze of tragedies that had no exit.`
`"What are the snipers doing?`
` The suspect is trying to harm the hostage!`
` Fire immediately!!"`
`As Ootaka yelled into the radio, Mion screamed for him to stop.`
`"No, no!!`
` Don't shoot Rena!!`
` Rena isn't crazy anymore!`
` She isn't who she was earlier!`
` That's a different Rena!`
` So please, don't shoot her!!"`
`"What do you mean, she's different?`
` Look!`
` She's swinging around that weapon!`
` She's trying to kill him!`
` Unless we shoot her down, the hostage is in danger!!"`
`"...No, no!!`
` Don't shoot at Rena!!`
`If you shoot Rena, Kei-chan will kill you for sure!!`
` I can guarantee it!!"`
`"Wh-Why would he kill me?"`
`"They aren't trying to kill each other!`
` They're just having fun creating sparks!!`
` Can't you see?`
`Kei-chan is talking to her, too.`
` He's telling her that they're equal!`
` That means she can trust him more than anyone!! `
`Kei-chan will wake Rena up!`
` No, he's already waking her up!!`
` Rena's nightmare is almost over!!"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you're the best!!`
`I don't even want to kill you anymore!!`
` A world without you would be so boring!!"`
`"Huh! Thanks for the compliment. I appreciate it!!`
` So what's going to happen to the world, huh?`
` Aren't aliens trying to invade it?"`
`"Ahahahahaahahaahahahahaha, ahhhahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahahahaha!!`
`You know, I don't think I even care about aliens or parasites anymore.`
` If the world is going to perish, go ahead and perish. Who cares about the conspiracy of the Three Families, anyway?"`
`"That's right, even if a meteor hits the Earth tomorrow..."`
`"Nothing could be more fun than this moment!!!!"`
`"Hey, aren't you supposed to die tonight due to some poison?`
`You sure don't look like you only have a few hours left to live!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` That's right, I completely forgot about that. I'm supposed to claw out my throat and die tonight!!"`
`"Hey, that's the scenario you came up with, don't forget.`
` Come on, scratch your throat once in a while, at least!!`
` Hey, I know, it doesn't itch anymore, does it?`
` It definitely doesn't!! `
`This is more fun than scratching your throat could ever be!"`
`"Yeah, this dance of ours really is way more fun!!!"`
`I wished it would never end!!`
`But my body was screaming.`
`I was breathing hard, and felt dizzy from lack of oxygen.`
`My upper body felt as light as a piece of paper, as if even a slight breeze could take me away.`
`...It really had been a blast, but I needed to end it soon...`
`I felt the same sadness as in that water gun fight.`
`Back then, it had been declared a draw.`
`"I wonder what will happen this time..."`
`"Who knows?`
` But one thing is for certain."`
`"What?"`
`"I loved doing this with you!!"`
`"Me too!!"`
`I jumped backwards and slammed the roof with my bat.`
`The sound was as intense as a huge drum,`
`and the noise woke up the people who were captivated by our fight.`
`The silence returned, and the chorus of higurashi filled the air.`
`"Okay...... let's pause for a moment."`
`"......Sure.`
` Let's end this with one more strike."`
`We started to move slowly... and increased the distance between us.`
`Everyone realized it.`
`This fight was ending very soon.`
`"Okay, this is it.`
` I'm going to ask you one more time."`
`"Hmm? What is it?"`
`"Ahahahaha, hey, you're betting something on this, right?`
` Isn't that why you were fighting?"`
`"I did?`
`Ahahahahahaha, sorry, I forgot."`
`"Tsk. You're hopeless.`
` Okay, listen carefully.`
` If I win,`
` you'll become my personal maid and serve me every day!!`
` You'll have introduce me to others as your master!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahaha, my uniform better be cute!"`
`"Of course it will.`
` There will be a variety of uniforms, ranging from old-fashioned ones to ones that are a little dangerous!!`
` They'll be custom-made so they'll fit you perfectly.`
` How about that?"`
`"My goodness.`
` I don't intend to lose, but that could be fun, somehow.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"If you win, Rena."`
`I paused for a moment.`
`"If you win, I'll believe your stories."`
`Rena was happy until just a moment ago, but that expression was suddenly wiped from her face.`
`"Aliens are invading the Earth and we have parasites in our brains. `
`The Sonozaki family is pulling the strings, they're researching the parasites in secret, and aliens will be in control of the world starting tomorrow. I will believe in that.`
` Also, since you're dying tonight, `
`I'll make sure you go peacefully, so don't worry."`
`"......It's not fun if I win, is it?`
` Your reward sounds a lot more fun, Keiichi-kun."`
`"Well, what can I do?`
` You did all this because of what I just said, right?"`
`"...............Yeah, I guess...`
` Sorry, I almost forgot."`
`Rena smiled sadly for a moment, but soon that expression was wiped off her face too.`
`"I'm going to win no matter what.`
` I want my personal maid!!"`
`"......Boo, boo.`
` It's not fun if I win."`
`"Then do you want to change it?`
` What do you want?"`
`......Finally, Rena smiled happily again.`
`The breeze dried our sweat.`
` It was a good feeling.`
`We no longer went crazy, even with the moon out.`
`We could finally enjoy the coolness of the evening.`
`It would be so nice if we could just lie down on our backs and gaze at the moon.`
`Still smiling a little, Rena spoke.`
`"I`
` want the same reward as yours, Keiichi-kun."`
`"What?`
` You want me to be your maid?`
` That's something."`
`"You don't have to be my maid.`
` But the rest is the same.`
` I want you to say 'good morning' to me every morning and 'good night' every night.`
` I want you to treat me well and let me play around all the time. `
`......Hmm?`
` Aha ha ha ha ha,`
` I guess`
` no matter who wins`
` we'll always...`
` be together."`
`"We'll be together, but the one who gets the special treatment is different."`
`"Aha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`""Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.""`
`"Why am I fighting with someone I like so much?"`
`"I don't know.`
` Why are we on the rooftop?`
` Why did we even come up here in the first place?"`
`"Ahahahahaha, I don't know.`
` I forgot."`
`"Maybe we're both airheads.`
` That's why we floated up here."`
`"Yep, we're airhead buddies."`
`"We're buddies, alright."`
`""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...""`
`"...Well then, shall we get started?`
` I don't want to cool down too much."`
`"You're right.`
` We better finish up before it gets too cold."`
`We readied our weapons and took our stances.`
`"I......`
` was going to suggest`
` that we stop this.`
` I really was."`
`I shook my head slowly.`
`"No.`
` We have to finish this.`
` ...Otherwise, it won't end.`
` Our fight won't end.`
` We can't quit.`
` We have to bring it to an end."`
`"...This isn't right.`
` It's possible that no matter who wins or loses, there will be no reward."`
`".........Even if that happens, we shouldn't hate each other.`
` So I'm going to tell you this now."`
`"......What?"`
`"It was fun."`
`"Yeah............ I feel the same way..."`
`"Rena...`
` Even if one of us dies, we'll see each other again.`
` And when we do..."`
`"We'll have fun in a normal way.`
` We'll laugh together in a normal way.`
` ......And we'll fall in love in a normal way.`
` We won't doubt each other.`
` We'll trust each other.`
`......And we'll meet again,`
` right?`
` For sure, right...?"`
`"Yes...`
` for sure..."`
`Tears appeared in Rena's eyes...`
`I noticed I was about to break down, too.`
`"Okay`
`......`
`...`
` are you ready?"`
`There was no signal.`
`But we stepped forward at the same time.`
`Our shadows jumped in the moonlight.`
`We were fighting so viciously earlier, but now it was like we were moving very slowly. We must have looked like a shadow play.`
`Everyone was watching the shadows dance.`
`Rena's shadow hit my metal bat violently.`
` As a result, I let go of it...`
`The metal bat bounced once on the roof, then rolled down to the schoolyard.`
`I had lost my weapon.`
`Here was Rena's chance. Of course, she wouldn't miss it...`
`I was lying flat on the roof, and Rena got on top of me.`
`Rena's knees were holding down my arms, and there was no way for me to fight back.`
`The moon was divided into two.`
`The shadow of Rena's hatchet had split the moon right down the middle.`
`This was the end.`
`"......Shit,`
` that was good.`
` I can't even pull my arms away."`
`"Hey, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...It's over...`
` right...?"`
`"Not yet.`
` It's not over until you swing down your hatchet."`
`"......I don't wanna."`
`"Huh?"`
`"...I don't want to.`
` ......`
`I don't want to..."`
`Rena's arms were still raised, but tears were pouring from her eyes.`
`"...What happened?`
` What went wrong?`
` I loved everyone`
` and I trusted everyone.`
` When did I start to doubt them?"`
`"..............."`
`"I don't know why I'm doing this to you... I don't know.`
` ...Why,`
` why am I`
` doing this to people...`
` I love so much?"`
`"You...`
` You`
` realized it.`
` You realized it in 'this' world!!!"`
`"I can't believe myself...`
`Every day was so much fun`
` but... why,`
` why...?`
` I didn't have any complaints,`
` I didn't worry about anything...`
` so why did I try to destroy everything with my own two hands...?"`
`"Rena... you're... you're incredible!"`
`After I killed you and Mion...`
` ...I didn't realize I had done anything wrong, so I left a note and called Ooishi-san.`
`I still believed that someone else was at fault.`
`Until,`
` I mean, even after I was dead!`
`I didn't even notice I had sinned.`
`How sad it was to kill my friends because of a little misunderstanding, even when they were trying to help me.`
`And`
` how painful it was not to realize`
` it was a sin...`
`"Therefore... you're amazing, Rena...`
` You didn't kill any of your friends.`
` You came to your senses ...before you committed a sin.`
` Ha ha, aha ha ha ha ha!! `
`You're incredible, Rena.`
` ......Just incredible...`
` You're totally different from me!!"`
`Rena stood up slowly and lowered her hatchet.`
`"I hurt my friend.`
` I hurt Mii-chan..."`
`"Just apologize to her.`
` Personally, I appreciate that the wounds will help me tell the twins apart."`
`"I've already killed..."`
`"Huh?`
` No, you haven't.`
` Who did you kill?"`
`"......Rina Mamiya... and Teppei Houjou..."`
`"Ah... those two..."`
`"......I thought it was right to kill them.`
`But the day I killed them...`
` the world started to go crazy.`
` Did that mean...`
` that it was wrong`
` to kill them...?"`
`"I don't know if it was right or wrong, but it wasn't the best thing you could have done."`
`"What do you mean, the best thing?"`
`"Don't you know?"`
`I grabbed Rena's head and embraced her.`
`Then I told her.`
`I told her something so simple.`
`It was so simple that anyone could think of it.`
`But Rena didn't do it.`
`I didn't do it either, back then.`
`"If you're in danger`
` or you feel like doubting others`
` or something sad happens..."`
`It was so simple...!`
`"You should talk to...`
` your friends!!!"`
`"That's right...`
` You're right.`
` ...Ooh...`
` whaaaahhhhh..."`
`Rena cried in my arms for a while.`
` ...She cried about the wrong choice she made at the very beginning.`
`The choice couldn't have been hard to see.`
`I'm sure it was something that was within her grasp.`
`How stupid it was to worry about it by herself.`
`She had friends.`
`She had friends whom she trusted.`
`Why did she think she couldn't talk to her friends about it?`
`"I was wrong...!!`
` Why didn't I talk about it?`
` Everyone trusted me, so why didn't I trust them?"`
`"......I was the same way before.`
` That's why I won't laugh at you.`
` But you realized it.`
` You realized it a lot sooner than I did!!"`
`We will trust each other.`
`We will never doubt our friends.`
`We will rely on each other.`
`We will talk to each other and help each other.`
`That's why friends are always happy, and why we can endure anything together...`
`"Okay, Rena.`
` Why don't we respond to the curtain call?`
` This is really the end of everything."`
`"Wh-What do you mean by the curtain call? What do you mean?"`
`"Well, I was just talking to myself.`
` Come on."`
`We stood up together, holding hands.`
` ...The moon was hanging behind us.`
`When I nodded, Rena threw away her hatchet. It disappeared into the darkness below.`
`Then I spoke to the audience in Hell, the demons who weren't expecting this ending.`
`I was proclaiming victory!`
`"That's all for tonight!`
` We overcame this tragedy!!`
` We'll never doubt each other again.`
` We'll be united forever!!`
` No matter what disaster might befall us, don't think we'll ever yield!! `
`Who cares about tragedy, who cares about disaster?`
` Even if the script is written by demons,`
` we'll tear the whole thing to pieces!!!"`
