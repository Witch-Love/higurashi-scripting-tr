`To Rika-chan who had whispered that, I...`
`"I'll just go see Mion for a bit."`
`After taking my leave from them, I left the classroom and headed to the faculty office where Mion had gone to make a phone call.`
`...It's not like I could do anything, even if I stayed by her. `
`I just hated staying still doing nothing but wallow in anxiety.`
`"Okay.`
` I'll send two of our subordinates to the clinic."`
`"I don't think she'll do it...`
` but you'll never know what's going to happen."`
`"Can we capture her by force if she does?"`
`"...Honestly, I don't want to do that...`
` What do you think we should do?"`
`"We made an agreement with the cops that we're going to give Rena Ryuugu to them right after we find her.`
` So even if we use force to capture her, we won't get in trouble."`
`"I'm not worried about losing face. I just feel sorry for Rena!`
` I really want to settle this calmly, if possible..."`
`"Well, she's still young.`
` So as long as she didn't kill someone or something, all she has to do is to apologize, and everything will be fine."`
`"Ah ha ha ha haa.`
` ...Well then, she might be out of our hands, ah ha ha."`
`"Oh, I mean, you know... As long as they don't find out about it, she'll be safe.`
` She'll definitely be safe.`
` ...Nobody really cares about the disappearance of those two anyway. `
`People think that they ran away somewhere because they did something wrong.`
` Those things happen all the time.`
` So, she's fine. Don't worry about it."`
`"She's out, she's safe, what? Are we playing baseball now?`
` Wa ha ha.`
` Anyways, please just be careful."`
`"Will do.`
` ...So, it's ok to capture her by force, right?"`
`"...Don't make any mistakes. You have to get her!`
` Please don't make it like a chase scene or anything like that."`
`I couldn't help but have a silly chat with Kasai-san.`
`When I put the phone down, I sensed Chie-sensei was looking at me.`
`...No wonder, as she had been able to hear the conversation clearly in this tiny room.`
`Chie-sensei put her spoon down, and with a sad look on her face, she asked the following:`
`"...Were you talking about Ryuugu-san?"`
`"Ah... yes."`
`"Sonozaki-san... do you know why Ryuugu-san ran away from home?`
` ...You're close, aren't you?"`
`It was hard for anyone to understand Rena's situation, except for me and Kei-chan.`
`So, most of them thought that Rena just ran away from home.`
`But after she did, the cops made too much of a fuss over it.`
`...Ooishi stupidly believed that the scrapbooks were a big scoop, and he overreacted in trying to find Rena.`
`He had patrol cars running around everywhere in the village. He even used the town council's phone directory to find her.`
`So, people in the village thought Rena did something wrong and was trying to run from the cops.`
`What was going to be difficult for me, more than finding her, was to make up a story to retrieve Rena's honor after they detain her.`
`...Hmm, what about this: Rena went for a walk, fell down and hit her head on the edge of some tofu, and lost her memory.`
` Ooishi misunderstood something big time, and he thought she was a criminal...`
`...It was too easy.`
`Anyway, we did make it clear that Ooishi was the one who misunderstood everything at the meeting the other day.`
`I had to make the best use of his name while he was feeling down for once.`
`What I'd have to do was to not make a big deal about this situation...`
` and to create an environment that allowed Rena to forget everything that happened, in order to get her life back together as soon as possible.`
`"Everything is going to be fine, Chie-sensei.`
` ...Rena is a little sick right now. That's all.`
` A fat cop somehow made a lovely mistake and got things twisted around. `
`You don't believe that Rena did something wrong and that she's trying to run from the police, do you?"`
`"...Of course not...`
` But... making her family worry by running away from home isn't a good thing to do, either."`
`...She had a fight with her father, and she ran away from home for a little while.`
`...She acted childish, and that's all. Maybe that'd be the best story to go with.`
`"I wonder if she had some problems she couldn't talk to anyone about.`
` ...I must be a bad teacher, because I never realized it...`
` I wish I could have sat down and talked with Ryuugu-san before all this happened..."`
`"Ahahahaha. Chie-sensei, you're taking it too seriously.`
` You need to relax...`
` It's normal for young kids nowadays to run away from home for a while!"`
`"Oh, nooooo. What am I going to do if Ryuugu-san becomes one of those bad kids and starts doing really bad things?!`
` Au au auuuu!"`
`Ryuugu-san becomes a bad kid.`
`↓\nShe does something bad and gets arrested by the police.`
`↓\nIt's her teacher's responsibility.`
`↓\nI'll be dishonorably discharged.`
`↓\nI can't eat curry anymore.`
`↓\nI'm dead.`
`"Oh, no. Oh, noooooo..."`
`...Chie-sensei seemed comically upset by her own imagination.`
`It looked funny, so I decided to leave her alone.`
`I made to leave the teacher's office to go back to the classroom, but...`
`Right then, the phone rang.`
`"Hello.`
` This is the Hinamizawa branch school."`
`Chie-sensei had to answer the phone all day today because the principal was on a business trip.`
`I exited to the hallway.`
`...Then, I heard the tone of her voice change.`
`"What?!`
` ...Wh-Where are you right now?!"`
`What?! I yelled and looked back at her.`
`It was probably Rena.`
` She called the school!`
`I tried to go back inside the teacher's office, but Chie-sensei gestured at me not to come in.`
`...Chie-sensei acknowledged what Rena was saying several times, and then, she looked up at the clock.`
`"Okay.`
` I'll be there.`
` ...I'm your teacher. You promise me, alright?"`
`She said only that, put the phone down, and got her purse out of her locker.`
`"Class president,`
` I have an emergency to take care of.`
` I'm going out for a while, so please have everybody study by themselves while I'm gone."`
`She took her car key out from her purse.`
`...It was obvious that she was going to see Rena somewhere.`
`"Chie-sensei, was it Rena?!"`
`"That's all.`
` You're in charge of the class, okay?"`
`Chie-sensei completely ignored me and she ran out into the hallway.`
`She ran to the schoolyard... and got into her car.`
`"Kei-chan!"`
`"What is it?`
` Where did Chie-sensei go in such a hurry?"`
`"There was a phone call from Rena!"`
`"Wha-! What did she say?!"`
`I ran after the teacher without answering that. Kei-chan followed behind me.`
`She ran to the schoolyard... and got into her car.`
`The moment her car left through the gate, I ran out to the schoolyard myself.`
`I headed for the black car parked near the gate and knocked on the window.`
`"How are you doing, milady?`
` Everything is quiet so far."`
`"I know!`
` But I need you to follow that car that just left!!`
` I think she's going to meet Rena!"`
`"What?!"`
`Keiichi yelled in surprise, but there wasn't any time left to explain it to him now.`
`"Rena is very paranoid, so you need to be careful.`
` Bring her to my house right after you catch her. After that, follow Kasai's orders!`
` She's my friend!`
` You better not get her hurt!"`
`...Rena must've told Chie-sensei that she wanted to talk to her alone.`
`I could tell that easily from the way she ignored my question.`
`I did feel a little bad for ruining their promise...`
` ...But it was very important that we caught her before she did something wrong.`
`We could still make up an excuse that she was just wandering around because she had a fight with her father and ran away from home.`
`...But if she set fire to the clinic or something, there would be nothing I could do.`
`"Mion, I'm coming too!"`
`"Kei-chan...?"`
`"If the teacher is going to see Rena, it's better if I go!`
` Please!"`
`".........`
` You're probably right.`
` Okay then, Kei-chan, get on quick!"`
`"Gotcha!"`
`Kei-chan opened the car door and swiftly climbed into the passenger seat. `
`While we were dilly-dallying, the teacher's car was beginning to disappear from our line of sight.`
`We could only pray we didn't lose sight of her......`
`"I'm counting on you, Kei-chan!"`
`"Yeah, leave it to me!"`
`The car made a rough u-turn on the gravel road, and it chased after Chie-sensei's car at full speed.`
`...As they tailed the shadow of the disappearing car, I could only pray for this series of misfortune to end on a quiet note.`
`Chie-sensei's car soon came into view.`
`...It was travelling at a very fast pace, but thankfully, she was the sort of person who didn't drive above the speed limit.`
`We passed the stone steps of the Furude Shrine and left the paved road partway, into a coarse mountain trail.`
`Where we were headed... wasn't even to the dam construction site, where the mountains of trash lay. `
`We were headed to an unknown location which I wasn't aware of, as I was still unfamiliar with the area.`
`"Where is this pathway headed to?"`
`"Most likely into the mountains.`
` If we carry on like this, we'll reach a route that leads to a neighborhood across the valley."`
`And as if it nodded in agreement with the driver's words, the vegetation around us opened up on one side, and we saw mountains in the distance and a valley between them.`
`I saw a stream up ahead and a suspension bridge straddling it.`
`According to him, there was certainly an unmanned office cabin in the vicinity set up for emergency purposes.`
`Judging by Chie-sensei's panic, had Rena threatened to jump off from there or something, if she didn't come?`
`If so, then why exactly?!`
`.........`
`.........`
`That's right. `
`Just why had she called Chie-sensei out to the suspension bridge...?`
`The sudden question triggered a throbbing anxiety, which spread across my chest.`
`...First of all, what did Rena even have to do with Chie-sensei?`
`I mean, it's not like they were on bad terms. Rena was a good student, so she had a good relationship with her teacher.`
`But it's not like she had a trusting relationship with her, enough to call her and consult her on such affairs.`
`And also... why the suspension bridge?`
`If it was a threat to "jump off if she didn't come", the shrine had a good enough elevation for that.`
`She didn't have to call her all the way out here... `
`.........`
`"―ugh, fuck!!"`
`I was astonished, finally having understood Rena's intentions.`
`"Driver, please stop Chie-sensei's car!"`
`"Eh, ehh?"`
`"Hurry!!!"`
`.........`
`As we noisily rang the car horn, Chie-sensei's car came to a halt, almost close enough to hit us, and she got down looking stunned.`
`And after recognizing me in the passenger seat of the car behind hers, she tried to yell out, but I beat her to it and cried "We're in big trouble!"`
`"W-What?"`
`"Sensei, we've been duped by Rena!`
` Rena isn't here!"`
`"H-Huh?"`
`The teacher didn't understand what I was talking about and donned a confused expression.`
`But, there wasn't even any time to explain it to her, so I flew towards the phone booth near us, put a 10 yen coin in the slot and dialed the phone number to the staffroom which I vaguely recalled.`
`.........`
`......`
`Please, somebody answer!`
`Mion, Satoko, Rika-chan, ...I don't care if it's somebody else either!`
`I had to tell this to the people at school fast!`
`So, hurry!`
`Hurry up and pick up the phone!`
`............`
`......`
`And then, after the phone had rang around 10 times and I had almost given up...`
`The call went through.`
`"...H-Hello?"`
`"......"`
`"Excuse me, this is Maebara!`
` Please put Mion Sonozaki on the line right away!"`
`"......"`
`"Hello?`
` Can you hear me, hello?!?!"`
`I didn't know if it was because I was using an old phone, or because the line was too far away, but I couldn't hear anything from the receiver.`
`And then, when I was about to raise my voice and yell into the phone...`
`".........`
` What is it, Keiichi-kun?`
` I wonder what you want with Mii-chan... I wonder...?"`
`"—!!"`
`......My prediction was on the mark.`
`It was even worse than I had imagined.`
`"......Re-Rena.`
` You're over there now, aren't you...?"`
`"Yup.`
` I'm here.`
` With Mii-chan and the others.`
` Ahahahahaha!"`
`"...!!"`
`"It's a shame you aren't here, Keiichi-kun.`
` It's pretty hard to do this by myself.`
` They made a lot of noise screaming and crying and it really got to my head, so I ended up hitting them a few times.`
` Ahahahahahaha!"`
`"W-What the hell have you done...!`
` H-Hey Rena!`
` Listen, Chie-sensei is here with me too!`
` So calm down and listen to what I..."`
`"Ah, so you ended up going there, huh?`
` Then I'll listen to what you have to say here, okay?`
` Come quick, I'll be waiting for you."`
`"W-Wait, Rena!!`
` Stop, don't hang up—!"`
`Those words fell on dead ears.`
`Rena who was on the other side swiftly ended the conversation like it was nothing.`
`"Okinomiya PS to all vehicles.`
` Okinomiya PS to all vehicles.`
` A hostage situation has broken out at the Hinamizawa forestry service building.`
` There are reportedly multiple hostages. `
`All vehicles are to head to the forestry service building immediately."`
`"Kuma-chan!!`
` Sorry I'm late!`
` What's going on?"`
`"Hello, sir!`
` Today around one PM, the Hinamizawa branch school's classroom was taken over. `
`The suspect's initial demands were to prohibit all entry to the branch school's property and to secure a hotline to us."`
`"...So they're willing to negotiate with us from the start?`
` What's going on?"`
`"Also, the suspect is asking for you, Ooishi-san.`
` It's Reina Ryuugu."`
`"Ryuugu-san?`
`............Very well.`
` We seem to be inseparable, huh?`
` I'll be dealing with her until the end."`
`Ooishi gave a crooked smile.`
`"We don't know if she has any accomplices.`
` The curtains are closed, so we can't confirm the situation."`
`"Have you asked whoever told us about this?"`
`"No, Reina Ryuugu declared it herself.`
` Therefore, we don't know what's going on inside. `
`Right before the crime, the teacher in-charge and one of the students had received a phone call from Reina Ryuugu, and the crime took place while they were away."`
`"This has been well planned, huh?`
` Has anyone from the forestry service been taken hostage?"`
`"Nobody from the service was there today.`
` All twenty-four hostages are students.`
` That number matches with the attendance the teacher took this morning."`
`"Plus the suspect, right?`
` Have you seen anyone else suspicious other than Reina Ryuugu?"`
`"No. We've seen someone peeking out from behind the curtain, but it was the suspect herself.`
` We're guessing there must be at least one or two more of them, though."`
`"Rena-chan is a good girl...!`
` For her to do something like this, there must be some mistake...!`
` Oooh!"`
`"Are you okay?"`
`Ooishi ran up to Chie-sensei, who was crying with a handkerchief held up to her face.`
`Chie-sensei was huddled over, and Ooishi didn't think he could say anything else to her.`
`"Mr. Ooishi, please...`
` If possible, I would like to request to be a hostage myself.`
` I will take the place of the children."`
`"Let me do that instead!!`
` It's all my fault, ahhhhhhhhhhh!!"`
`"Please, don't blame yourselves.`
` I have things I want to ask you, so I'd appreciate it if you cooperated.`
`Bonchi-kun!`
` Please show them the blueprints."`
`"Excuse me, sir!`
` Section Chief Takasugi is on the radio!"`
`"Hello, this is Ooishi."`
`"Ooishi-san, how goes things?`
` Kumagai-kun informed me of the situation.`
` The suspect is underage, huh?`
` Please keep strict control of the press!"`
`"I understand.`
` Also, the suspect is requesting me as a negotiator. Is that okay with you?"`
`"For now, if that's the suspect's demand, we have no choice.`
` ...It's up to you."`
`"Ooishi-san...!`
` Reina Ryuugu's on the car phone!"`
`"That was faster than expected.`
` I'll go get it.`
`.........Thank you.`
` ......Hello, this is Ooishi."`
`"Ugh...!!"`
`I clenched my teeth in frustration and rolled up my fists into a ball.`
`An overwhelming wall of police officers blocked my way, and I felt pathetic for only being able to watch the teachers and the detectives from afar.`
`The reason behind why Chie-sensei had been phoned and summoned out of the school.`
`...For Rena who wanted to hijack to classroom, the biggest obstacle was Chie-sensei.`
`She was someone who had a strong sense of justice.`
`Even if Rena had held a pistol to her, Chie-sensei probably wouldn't have hesitated.`
`For the welfare of her students, she would put herself in danger... getting rid of someone like her was the primary step in order to hijack the classroom.`
`Attacking her from behind would have been her very first line of thought but,`
` I'm sure she decided taking on an adult directly was a risky affair.`
`...In that case, it was better to lure her away to someplace..!`
`Rena had then phoned Chie-sensei, and then told her she wished to seek her advice in someplace private... and asked to meet her near that suspension bridge.`
`Including Chie-sensei, a good majority of the people thought that Rena had merely run away from home.`
`...So Chie-sensei probably thought Rena merely had some troubles she wished to discuss.`
` ......Fooling her was that easy.`
`So... where did Rena make the call from...?`
`Yes, it was from within the school.`
` Well, not exactly.`
`It was most likely from the second floor of the school building, .......from the office room of the Forestry Service.`
`The Forestry Service at our school was more like a branch office, so it wasn't like the staff were always present.`
` Depending on the day, they might not even be there.`
`Rena had known this, and had been hiding on the second floor all this time.`
`And then, she had made a call to the ground floor from up there, ......and sent Chie-sensei to a faraway place.`
`It probably wasn't a coincidence that the principal had also been away on a business trip today.`
`......Rena had most likely snuck into the school yesterday itself.`
`And then, she had discerned the principal's itinerary and the workings of the internal phone line before she put her plan into action.`
`......How cunning it all was......`
`......No, I understood.`
`...Right now, even as she was possessed by a murderous rage, ...Rena was keeping her composure.`
`...She was unbelievably calm despite being plagued by her delusion that controlled her.`
`...And so, just thinking about it made my head spin.`
`...Because I had even personally experienced what she was going through before.`
`Also, what was even more unlucky was the absence of the Sonozaki Family bodyguard who had been standing by the gate.`
`......It was because Mion had sent him to follow Chie-sensei who had set out to meet Rena.`
`.........Fuck, everything was so screwed up... on so many levels.........`
`"We're trying to come up with a plan for the simultaneous raids as we speak. We're talking to the prefectural police as well as the Public Safety Division. `
`We're talking about the entire city, so we need a little more time to prepare for it..."`
`"You're taking too long!!!`
` Ooishi-san, don't you realize what kind of emergency situation Shishibone City is in right now?`
` What are you doing?`
` Ooishi-san...... you do believe me, don't you?`
` You're my ally, right? `
`Right?`
` Please answer me!!!"`
`"O-Of course, I am!`
` But the police department is a little more complicated than you think...`
` I'm doing my best, I really am!`
` The thing is`
` this is on a really big scale..."`
`...The negotiations weren't that satisfactory, to be honest.`
` Even as they spoke, it was clear from the overwhelming tension that Rena's patience was wearing thinner and thinner.`
`"...Okay, call Keiichi-kun over here"`
`"What?`
` Could you say that again?"`
`"Isn't Keiichi-kun there right now?`
` I'd like to talk to him now so please call him over immediately!"`
`"...I-I understand."`
`Ooishi asked one of his subordinates to summon the boy who stood in the front line of the crowd gathered at the barricade.`
`He immediately jogged over to the car as soon as he was called.`
`"You must be Keiichi Maebara, I assume?"`
`"Y-Yes..."`
`"Miss Rena Ryuugu would like to have a word with you.`
` Could you please take the call?"`
`"...I understand."`
`Ooishi then handed over the receiver to Keiichi and he noticed something happening outside and left the car.`
`"...Hello?"`
`"Ah, Keiichi-kun...?`
` It's good that you came back here."`
`"Rena..."`
`"The police isn't believing what I'm telling them.`
` Could you please tell them that the things I'm saying are true, and that I'm very serious about what I'm about to do... could you?"`
`".........`
` What do you mean by... 'what I'm about to do'...?"`
`"I've just finished pouring gasoline all over this classroom.`
` So, if I just ignite the lighter I have on hand, all the hostages here will die.`
` ...Could you please let Ooishi-san know about that?"`
`"Wha-?!"`
`"Wh-Who are you people?!"`
`"Move over.`
` Who's in charge here?"`
`Several cars had arrived, producing several men. They weren't from the Okinomiya station.`
`One of the men was wearing a suit, despite the hot weather. He approached me, pushing Kumagai aside.`
`"...Hey, look who's here.`
` Good to see you again, Ootaka-kun from the prefectural headquarters."`
`"Watch your mouth.`
` I'm ranked much higher than you now, so don't address me so casually."`
`"Can I help you with something, Ootaka-<i>kun</i>?`
` I'm rather busy at the moment.`
` You can't possibly be thinking about taking over this case?`
` Who approved that, exactly?"`
`"I did, Ooishi-kun!"`
`"Ch-Chief...?"`
`"Takasugi-kun has informed me of the situation.`
` He also told me that you started all this.`
` You can go now. The troops will take over!"`
`"The troops? ...Ootaka-kun, you aren't going to storm the building, are you?"`
`"I understand the risk.`
` But we don't have any time left before the bomb goes off.`
` You've taken too long.`
` We're here to take care of the mess you left behind.`
` Just step back for a minute."`
`I couldn't talk back if both the chief and a guy from the prefectural headquarters gave me an order.`
`"O...Ooishi-san, who the heck is he?"`
`"That's Ootaka-kun.`
` Nfu fu, a long time ago, he was showing off even though he was bad at mahjong, so I taught him a lesson. `
`Or maybe he's still holding a grudge from when I knocked him unconscious in that kendo tournament."`
`Obviously, we didn't get along.`
`"Give me the latest update, Ooishi-kun."`
`"Are you serious about storming the school?"`
`"A special unit from the prefectural police department will handle the infiltration.`
` Your unit will be their backup."`
`"...Chief."`
`"Ooishi-kun,`
` the special unit from the prefectural police department isn't just any old unit.`
` You've heard about the Second Company, haven't you?"`
`"What's that, Ooishi-san?`
` Is this "Second Company" that well known?"`
`"Do you remember, about five years ago,`
` when the JRA hijacked that airplane? Flight 472?`
` I've heard that special counter-terrorist units were put together in Tokyo and Osaka after that incident. `
`So they really do exist..."`
`"B-But why would a special unit from Osaka be here?"`
`Ootaka smiled proudly.`
`"We just happened to be holding a training session with your prefectural police unit.`
` We requested their help."`
`"Na ha ha... you haven't changed, have you?`
`...You have a bad tendency to escalate matters quickly."`
`The Company members exited the vehicles one after another and took position.`
`They didn't move like policemen...`
`"Ootaka-kun!`
` Are you really going to have a gunfight here?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` They won't use firearms.`
` They're using riot shields and riot guns.`
` These guns send out tear gas at high pressures.`
` There will be no issue with explosions."`
`"......Wow, I've never heard of such convenient water guns.`
` By the way, can that toy reach the classroom from across the schoolyard?"`
`"You don't need to worry about that.`
` You just move over and let us do our job."`
`And then, following Ootaka's orders, the special forces took positions at a blind spot visible from the school window and prepared to infiltrate.`
`Ooishi wrinkled his nose at Ootaka's arrogance and pretentious attitude that didn't give way for counterarguments. Remembering that Rena and Keiichi were having a conversation, he turned on his heel heading over to the patrol car.`
`And there...`
`"Detective, we have an emergency!!"`
`At once, the door to the car swung open and Keiichi rushed over to him screaming.`
`"What's the matter, Maebara-san?"`
`"Re-Rena just told me she's poured gasoline all over the classroom...!!"`
`"Whaaa?!"`
`Gasoline...?! I didn't hear that there was something so inflammable in the vicinity!! No, it's not about that, right now—!!`
`"Preparing to shoot, steady—"`
`"P-Please wait!`
` Stop, don't shoot!!"`
`"Fire~!!"`
`"Uwaaaahhhh!!"`
`............ `
`......`
`Our bodies were promptly blown away and hit the ground, we didn't understand what had happened for a moment.`
`".........`
` ...gh...?"`
`A high pitched tinnitus violently reverberated within my skull, and an overwhelming dizziness distanced me from my consciousness.`
`My throat and nasal passage felt irritated from the suspended dust particles and smoldered air.`
`".....gh."`
`Spitting out the crunchy debris from my mouth, I dragged my beaten body up into a stance, and faced forward, looking ahead of me.`
`"............ `
`......... `
`...Ah.........?"`
`There were many police officers scattered about on the ground, groaning from the impact.`
`...A voice of agony filled the air next to me. ...As I faced it, it turned out to be the detective I'd been talking to just now.`
`"Ugh... ...!!"`
`His entire body was covered in dirt and debris, and he was bleeding from his head.`
`As I began to sit down in concern for him, I suddenly remembered Mion and Rena's safety.`
`And then, I turned towards the direction of the school.`
`...I`
` ...couldn't believe`
` ...what I was seeing.`
`"............"`
`What stood before me was a disordered conglomerate of wood, bricks and other distorted articles mixed in... crudely resembling an enormous camping bonfire.`
`The flames that had risen up in between that mass burned so high they seemed to reach up into the evening twilight.`
`Even from this faraway distance, I could perceive the heat and the scorching smell.`
`"............"`
`...No.`
`No, this had to be a dream.`
`This couldn't be our school.`
`...`
`No, this wasn't even a school in the first place...`
`"............"`
`I staggered over.`
`Fumbling forward with my useless legs, I walked over to that monstrosity.`
`And then before me, amidst the crumbled remains of timber, I discovered a face I recognized and drew a breath before I rushed over.`
`"Mion...!"`
`Mion's eyes were wide open, facing my way, with her right arm raised.`
`Her mouth was slightly open... she probably couldn't speak.`
`"Thank god... Mion...!"`
`I had to get her out here first!`
`Thinking that, I tightly grasped that right arm—.`
`"............"`
`It felt light, there was no resistance.`
` And then, from within the rubble,`
` 'it' came out.`
`"......Ah..."`
`And then, a small mass rolled over,`
` and touched my feet.`
`Mi`
`on's`
` head`
` had`
` co`
`me`
` a`
`part`
` `
`from`
` `
`her`
` `

`.`
`.`
`.`
`"U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!`
` Aaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!"`
