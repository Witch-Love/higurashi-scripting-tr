`They were mowing the grass near the fence, which was probably a cover to monitor the surroundings.`
` Just in case, I tried to escape from the school.`
`...But they must have been thinking that would happen only after school was over.`
` They seemed to have no idea that I'd already noticed their plan and was trying to run away right at that very moment.`
`I couldn't use the front gate, since they'd find me easily.`
`I moved behind the school building, made sure nobody was around the curry garden, ran through it, and dashed into the forest.`
`I walked through the dense undergrowth, stepping on dead wood and climbing over fallen trees.`
`After walking through the forest for a while, I came to a small road.`
`I know many back roads in this village because of our club activities, and that knowledge had finally come in handy.`
`So, what should I do now...?`
`I'm sure the girl already passed on my message to Chie-sensei.`
`Those men must be going crazy by now, knowing that I ran away.`
`"Did anyone else talk to Ryuugu-san before she left school?"`
`Everybody in the class looked at each other and shook their heads.`
`Chie-sensei looked a bit upset that Rena left school early without telling her in person.`
`"Rena-san has been feeling sick these days."`
`"......Meep."`
`"She left her bag here.`
` ...What happened to her?"`
`"............I have a bad feeling about this."`
`"What?"`
`I think I know what's going on.`
`...I'm not sure, but I have a very bad feeling about this.`
`She must've taken another ridiculous story seriously or something... I hope she won't do anything crazy...`
`I hurried home.`
`My father might be at his new job, or he might've gone shopping.`
` ...He wasn't around when I got there.`
`Now that they're on the move, I'm no longer safe in my house.`
`They're very dangerous people. They're trained to be capable of attacking the Ministry of Construction, and they actually pulled off the kidnapping of the grandson of the Minister.`
`Locked doors and windows don't mean anything to them.`
` In fact, it'd be like I was hiding in a box, which they could just open up to get at me.`
`...I could no longer stay at my home.`
`It's very sad, and very frustrating.`
`I killed Rina and Teppei, and finally regained a peaceful life with my father.`
`How could this happen to me?!`
`I remembered what Keiichi-kun told me before. It expressed my feelings better than anything.`
`"Takano-san left us a huge parting gift...!"`
`Why did she give me those terrifying scrapbooks?!`
`Why did she tell me the secret of that unthinkable conspiracy?!`
`She got me into this.`
`I didn't do anything. It's all Miyo-san's fault!`
`But who was interested in her stories? I was. Who let her continue talking? I did. I did that out of curiosity.`
`Who let the memories of Ibaraki return and told Miyo-san about them? I did.`
`I depended on Miyo-san, hoping that she could somehow save me from the memories I'd been trying to forget.`
`I shouldn't have remembered anything about that bizarre incident!`
`If I hadn't, I wouldn't have gotten involved in that unthinkable conspiracy, and I could've just played around with my friends today!!`
`...But even if I didn't know about the conspiracy, it'd still continue behind the scenes.`
`I would've been one member of the mob running in a panic, not knowing what's going on, on the Day of Oyashiro-sama's Revival. I would've been just swallowed up in their conspiracy anyway.`
`Would I be happier if I faced that day without knowing anything?`
`Would I be happier if I struggled, knowing about it but ending up swallowed by it?`
`...If I'm going to end up the same way no matter what I choose to do`
` ...I'll fight.`
` I'll choose to fight.`
`Because that's how I seized my happiness before.`
`...When Rina invaded my home, seducing my father,`
` I felt like it was the end of the world. I lived on the verge of despair every day.`
`I thought that was the worst misfortune that could befall anyone.`
`But the way things are going, it wasn't really that bad at all.`
`I had only two enemies, Rina Mamiya and Teppei Houjou.`
`I knew my enemies, and I knew how many they were. I lured them out one by one, and I attacked them in the dark. It was a very easy problem to solve.`
`But what about this one?`
`I don't know who my enemies are, and I don't know how many or how strong they are.`
`Even the people I once trusted might be my enemies!`
`I can't possibly be sure!`
` It's totally different from the previous problem.`
`This might be the end of the world.`
`This time, it really was the worst thing that could possibly happen.`
`But is that really the case...?`
`With Rina, I felt like it was the end of the world, but I no longer think it was that bad.`
`So, this might turn out to be an easy problem to solve in the end, and I might be able to laugh about it someday.`
` ...I know that day will come.`
` I know it for sure!`
`So, I shouldn't think that this is the end of the world.`
`Let's fight.`
` I can fight.`
` I can still struggle!`
`I'd eat grass and drink mud if I needed to.`
`I'm going to bet on the 1% chance even though it's unbelievably small.`
`If Miyo-san didn't leave me the scrapbooks, I wouldn't even have been able to sit at the table to bet.`
`I was lucky that I received the scrapbooks because they gave me the chance to choose my future.`
`If I don't fight, they'll spread the terrible parasite, and this village will face a great disaster.`
`According to the legend, when the "demons" first came out of the swamp, people became demons right after being infected.`
`And it happened while they were inside the village.`
`These days, symptoms appear only when infected people leave the village, but that only applies to the later, weak parasite.`
`The original parasite can reenact "the curse of Oyashiro-sama" even when the infected are in the village!`
`The legend of Oyashiro-sama will be reborn.`
`Humans and demons will start killing each other... and "Oyashiro-sama" will come down to pacify the disaster.`
`That's what they want!!`
`They want people to prostrate themselves before that miracle, and only the people who truly worship Oyashiro-sama will be saved.`
`...I see... I know their true intention now...`
`They're going to reenact the legend of Oyashiro-sama!`
`After all, the villagers always say that Rika-chan is his reincarnation.`
` The stage is all set!`
`They're going to use the parasite as the "curse".`
`So... how are they going to make it look like Oyashiro-sama came down to pacify everyone?`
`I get it!`
` They must have some kind of medicine,`
` a specific cure for the parasite!!`
`When they recreated the stronger form of the parasite, they found a cure for it at the same time.`
`They're going to use this cure to save only those people who believe in Oyashiro-sama, and as a result this village will only have those fervent believers.`
`They're going to make themselves the absolute rulers of Hinamizawa!`
`Wait... I still might be underestimating them. Are they going to carry out that horrifying act of bioterrorism only inside Hinamizawa...?`
`History proves that, when their goal is to control others, people desire to spread their religion across a wide area.`
`I'm sure that they conducted research not only to bring back the primitive form of the parasite, but also to overcome its weakness--namely, that it only thrives in Hinamizawa.`
`According to Miyo-san's research, the parasite doesn't like its hosts to be far from the region.`
`Its weakness is distance.`
`If they could extend the distance...`
` If they could extend the area where it can live...`
`I wonder how far along their research is.`
`By now, the parasite might be able to live not only in Hinamizawa but in Okinomiya as well.`
` Or maybe even in the city?`
`...Maybe the whole prefecture?`
`It might be able to cover nearby prefectures as well!`
`This is too serious to just call it a conspiracy.`
`It's horrifying enough, and its scale large enough, to call it a revolution!!`
`The Day of Revival is probably not far off.`
`I can tell by how they killed Miyo-san and by the extent of their pressure they're putting on me.`
`They're trying to get rid of the small fish bones stuck in their throat by any means, because that day is coming ever closer!`
`I'm the only one who can stand up against their revolution.`
`I can't trust anybody.`
` ...I think I can trust Keiichi-kun.`
` But no one else!!`
`Mii-chan is out of question.`
` I can't trust Rika-chan, either.`
` Satoko-chan and Rika-chan stick together like superglue, so I can't trust Satoko-chan, either.`
` I can't trust any adults. I can't trust anybody!!`
`No one is on my side.`
`I have to stand up against them alone.`
`The clock is ticking towards that day, and the ticking noise made me frustrated.`
`How should I fight against them?`
` What should I do?!!`
`I needed time to think.`
`I needed a place, a "safe area," where I could concentrate on thinking.`
`Fortunately, I had such an area already.`
`My hideout at the garbage dump!`
`Nobody ever goes there, so it's safe.`
`Even if they found out about that place, I'm familiar with its surroundings. I know escape routes and places where I can hide.`
`But it has a big shortcoming, as a hiding place.`
`It's not hard to imagine what that is.`
` I don't have any stock of food there.`
`That's why I came home.`
`I opened one of my father's drawers, and took out his cash box.`
`The contents haven't changed since the last time I looked inside.`
`There were many new 10,000 yen bills in the cash box.`
`I took them all.`
` I couldn't tell how many bills there actually were, but it looked to be about 80 of them.`
`This should be... plenty.`
`If I evaded them long enough to use all of this money, that would mean that I did pretty well.`
`Plus, I might use it to buy someone off.`
` You can never have too much money, especially in a situation like this.`
`I didn't take the bank book.`
`If they were waiting in ambush at the bank, I'd be done for.`
` It's too risky to withdraw money at the bank.`
`I grabbed my backpack.`
` I took the key for my bicycle.`
`I put everything I think would be convenient to have into the backpack.`
`I didn't care if it got heavy.`
` I'd choose what was necessary to carry around later at my hideout. If there ended up being something I didn't need, I could leave it there.`
`I looked at the clock.`
`It had been 30 minutes since I came home.`
`I stayed here too long!`
`I rushed out of the house.`
`I went to a small convenience store, and bought as much sweet bread and canned food as I could fit in my backpack.`
`An old lady was at the register. Probably suffering from dementia, she showed no interest in the extraordinary amount of food I was buying.`
`...But as soon as the manager of the store checked the sales that night, he'd find out.`
`...The idea didn't bother me, because I can no longer walk around the village in the daylight anyway.`
`My backpack was full, and the cans hurt my back as I walked.`
` But that didn't bother me either.`
`I got to my hideout, still carrying the heavy backpack.`
`I organized the stuff I brought.`
`...It was very heavy to carry, but now I had sufficient food.`
`The abandoned construction office still has running water, so I could get some from there.`
`I'd wanted to get some vegetables, but in a situation like this, I could hardly complain.`
`After I organized things, I took out the scrapbooks I hid here, and put my brain into top gear, flipping through the pages.`
`So, now what?`
` How am I going to stand up against this gigantic conspiracy?`
`I needed to calm down, stay cool, but also to think fast!`
`There might not be a lot of time, so I'd have to hurry, but I don't know what to do!`
`It's easy to run to school in the morning when I oversleep.`
`It's easy because I know where I should go!`
`But now, I don't know where I should go to or what I should do!`
`Now that I've come to this point, I should tell Ooishi-san everything.`
`...It's highly likely he's an enemy.`
`But that doesn't matter anymore. If it was true, I'd just declare war!`
`But if he was on my side... he'd be my only remaining hope!`
`I'm far too weak to stand alone against the terrifying scale of this conspiracy poised to instill fear throughout Japan!`
`I'd have to use a public phone to make the phone call.`
`...There's only one public phone in this village that stands at a place where it's hard for people to spot you...`
` That phone booth!`
`It stands in the middle of nowhere where nobody really comes around. Many bugs gather around the light when it's dark, and it's not a pleasant place to go to. `
`But I can't think of any other public phones I can use to contact Ooishi-san without being seen.`
`Even though it stands in the middle of nowhere, it's still dangerous to use in the daylight.`
`...I should wait until nightfall and take advantage of the darkness.`
`I heard that Ooishi-san has been holed up in the station since Miyo-san's murder case, so I should be able to reach him anytime.`
` I have the number for the direct line to his office too.`
`The sky was still bright.`
`Even though I had no time, I still had to wait for it to get dark!`
`Frustrated, I glared at the sunset.`
`I should find something to do.`
`I couldn't waste any time that I had, so there must be something to do!!`
`After I thought about what I could do, I found there was something I wanted to confirm. Something I've been worried about.`
`I couldn't do anything else before it got dark anyway.`
` Staying here doing nothing would just make me more frustrated.`
`I made my decision, and left the hideout.`
`Rena's father paced up and down restlessly in front of his house.`
`A bicycle appeared, its rider ringing the bell.`
`"Police officer!!`
` Here! Over here!!"`
`A police officer from the Hinamizawa police station had shown up.`
`Having rushed to get there, he was breathing hard.`
`"Haah, haah!`
` I hope you didn't wait too long. Please tell me what happened."`
`"I know I locked the door before I left.`
` But when I came back, the door was left open and..."`
`He led the police officer into the house.`
`"And... look... my cash box was left open in my room..."`
`"Is this how you found it?`
` You didn't touch anything?"`
`"I didn't touch the cash box itself because I thought they might have left fingerprints.`
` I did touch the contents a little bit to check what was missing..."`
`"Hmm. And what did they take?"`
`"They didn't take my bankbooks or my personal seal, but... they took the cash."`
`"They didn't take your bankbooks or personal seal, huh?`
` You were lucky.`
` ...Professional thieves today don't take bankbooks because they know how easily they can get caught by using them. `
`...This might be a professional cat burglar.`
` ...Instead of taking the cash box with him, he opened it here. He has to be a pro.`
` So, how much cash was in there?"`
`"...Umm... I haven't counted it for a long time... but I believe there were about a hundred 10,000 yen bills."`
`"Ah... I see...`
` Did you tell anybody that you had that much cash in here?"`
`"...No, I didn't. But... they probably knew I kept some cash in the house..."`
`"They? Who are 'they'?`
` Can you tell me more about them...?"`
`"...Well, it's kind of an embarrassing story...`
` Her name is Rina Mamiya, and..."`
`Just then, the phone rang.`
`"...Oh, excuse me. I'll just go get that.`
` Please give me a minute."`
`He grabbed the phone.`
`"Hello. This is the Ryuugu residence."`
`"Ah!`
` ...Umm, hello.`
` This is Maebara. Is Rena-san there?"`
`"No, she hasn't come back from school yet."`
`"She hasn't?!`
` ...Umm..."`
`"I'm very sorry, but I'm in the middle of something right now.`
` Can you call back later...?`
` I'm sorry. Bye."`
`He hung up after that.`
`I was stunned.`
`It didn't look like anything had changed on the surface.`
`It was hard to find this place at all, because it perfectly blends in with the surroundings.`
`I only found this place again because I remembered there was a tree with a big lump of wood on it nearby.`
`The spot where I buried the corpses was perfectly camouflaged, as if nothing had happened.`
`That's why, at first, I thought I came to the wrong place.`
`But I could make certain once I stick a shovel in the ground.`
`I should be able to tell right away whether this place was dug up before or not.`
`After several false starts, I found the exact spot where I buried the corpses.`
`.........But the biggest problem of all...... is that there are no bags in there at all!`
`Why?`
` How come?!!`
`Did I bury them deeper than this?`
`No, I didn't.`
`I remember exactly how deep I buried them.`
` I know I didn't bury them deeper than this!`
`...I wasn't expecting this.`
`I came here to check the corpses... I just wanted to do that to kill some time.`
`I didn't want to stay in my hideout doing nothing, so I came here to check if the corpses I buried were still there.`
`I'd make sure that they were still there, and I'd feel relieved.`
` It was supposed to go like that!`
`This was such an unexpected turn of events that I broke out into a cold sweat.`
`What's going on?`
` What's going on?!`
`I don't need to calm down to think about what happened.`
`Corpses can't come back to life and crawl out of the ground.`
`Someone must've dug them out!`
`Who did it, and for what purpose?!`
`Did anyone happen to see us burying the corpses here, and did they dig them out after we left?`
` What if they handed them over to the police...?`
`No, it can't be.`
`It's been quite a while since the day we buried them here.`
` It was before the Watanagashi festival.`
`So if the police did find the corpses... when Ooishi contacted me, he had to know about Rina and Teppei.`
`But he didn't tell me anything about them.`
` I don't think he was hiding anything on purpose, either.`
`So, that means the police don't know about Rina and Teppei yet!`
`Then, why are the corpses gone?`
`That would leave only one answer.`
`...Who knows about this place?`
`One of us came back here, dug out the bags, and took them away!!`
`The first person who comes to mind is Mion, I mean, the Sonozaki family. But I can't think of a reason why they would do that.`
`The murder of Rina and Teppei has nothing to do with them.`
`I'm sure they don't want to get involved either, let alone be falsely accused.`
` They must want to stay as far away from this case as possible.`
`Why would they want to keep the corpses? It's like keeping a joker even though you'll lose if you have the joker by the end of the game!`
`...If I was Mii-chan, what would I do?`
` What would I do if I was club president...?`
`The joker is a card that you want to get rid of, at least in the game I mentioned earlier. But it becomes a powerful card in other games.`
`...What kind of game would that be...?`
`An electric shock ran through my spine.`
` ...At the same time, I realized it--they are one step ahead of me...!`
`The Sonozaki family got the corpses to use them as a joker, as a wild card. They're trying to use them to sell me out to the police!`
`The Sonozaki family is trying to kill me using their death squad, but they want to have insurance just in case they fail.`
`The thing they're afraid of the most is that I might work together with the police.`
`If they could prevent that from happening, I'd have no one to work with.`
`If that happens, I can no longer run away from them. I'd still be a fish in their pond!`
`They're going to use the corpses...`
` to sell me out to the police for the murder of Rina and Teppei!`
`If the police started seeing me as a suspect, they'd never listen to my story.`
`...They could have been my last hope, but this will certainly turn them against me!`
`But I'm sure the Sonozaki family doesn't want to use their joker unless absolutely necessary.`
`After all, Mion Sonozaki helped bury the corpses.`
`Plus, they don't want the police to hover around Hinamizawa when the Day of Revival is so close.`
`...I'm going to call Ooishi tonight, and I'm going to ask him for help.`
`...I'm going to tell him everything, including the things I haven't even told Keiichi-kun.`
`I don't know if Ooishi will believe me... This is a gamble, and my chance of winning is very small... Plus, my worst enemy has the joker, the bags with the corpses inside...!`
`...I'm impressed with Mion. That's just what I'd expect from the leader of our club.`
`...This is a battle that I'm betting my life on, but to Mion, this is like a board game, taking place across Hinamizawa itself.`
`I grinned, repeating to myself that it's just a game.`
`...I put my life on the line for every club activity we do, because I don't want to suffer the punishment.`
`This time, that's become the literal truth.`
`There could be only one reason why they're trying so hard to drive me into a corner.`
`It's because... they're afraid of me.`
`I assumed I was just a little girl with no power, running about in confusion.`
`But my enemy must not be thinking that way.`
`If they didn't think I was a threat to them, they wouldn't take risks like this to drive me into a corner.`
`That means... the scrapbooks Miyo-san left me... must be way more dangerous to them than I think they are.`
`...I see.`
` They have a joker,`
` but so do I.`
`The joker I have is so deadly and so powerful that it can break their plot into pieces.`
` ......That's why they're so eager to find me!`
`Ah ha ha...`
`A cornered mouse really can bite a cat.`
` I felt my fear towards my enemy fade away all of a sudden.`
`Just as I fear them, so do they fear me, too.`
`...So, this is an evenly matched game.`
` I don't have as bad a hand as I thought I did!`
`I was right to come here.`
`I found out about the card my enemy was holding. This is a big deal.`
`I felt myself shiver with excitement. I grinned to encourage myself.`
`I don't need to be here any longer.`
`They know this place. They might come here to find me.`
`...It's not safe for me to stay here for long.`
`I decided to go back to my hideout.`
`On the way back, I passed close to my house.`
`I noticed something different right away.`
`I hid behind a bush, and looked at the front gate of my house...`
`...My father was talking to a police officer.`
`...I strained to catch their conversation.`
`"Yes.`
` She usually parks it there..."`
`My father pointed to the place where I usually parked my bicycle.`
`"Hmmm...`
` Okay.`
` Please let us know whenever your daughter comes back.`
` We'll try to find her as well."`
`...Mii-chan, you're good...`
` Did you already play your joker...?`
`Mion always starts a battle by attacking without hesitation, and wins.`
`It seems like the police are already after me.`
`...My chance of being able to explain the conspiracy to Ooishi was already small, but this makes it even smaller.`
`No...`
` That's why I'm going to talk to Ooishi.`
`He sees the Sonozaki family as his enemy, and he's trying to expose everything about them before his retirement.`
` That's why he'll be on my side. He's not going to fall for their trick...!`
`Of course, there's a very high possibility that everything was part of their trap from the very beginning.`
`It's possible that he claimed the Sonozaki family was his enemy in order to make me believe that he's on my side.`
`...But their joker is actually giving me hope.`
`If Ooishi is one of them, it would be too early to play their joker.`
`Ooishi isn't one of them.`
`That's why they got the joker, so they can play it before I go to the police.`
`...No, wait. That might be a trick to make me think that way in order to make me trust Ooishi...!`
`When Mion gives me two choices to choose from, it's usually better to choose the one I like without thinking too much.`
`Mion, after all, likes to guess people's intentions in order to confuse them.`
`...So when you think about a choice too much, you're already in her trap.`
`I'm going to do as I planned.`
` I'm going to call Ooishi after it gets dark.`
`If he's going to become my ally, we can talk about the future.`
`And if he isn't?`
`...That, I realized, was what I had to think about before it got dark.`
