`"All right, with that...`
` Goodness, with that, today's work is finally complete.`
` Haah, good grief..."`
`*tap* *tap* *tap*`
`"...Anyway, today has been quite a difficult day.`
` All the other doctors and nurses needed to take time off for personal reasons."`
`"Well, one saving grace is that there weren't too many patients today."`
`......`
`"Masamichi-san was taking care of his mother, Yamaguchi-san had a marriage meeting today,`
` and Takano-san... Well, sometimes, she needs to stretch her wings."`
`"Yet, I can't say that couple was anything I could've expected... Goodness gracious.`
` Sheesh, human relationships can be so mysterious."`
`......`
`"...Haah, I wonder if an opportunity like that will come for me, some day."`
`"Anyway, I shouldn't be greedy.`
` As long as she has the knowledge and characteristics of a maid - the bare minimum required skills of cooking, laundry, and cleaning - then looks don't matter!"`
`"Of course, if she's cute, that's a super-duper welcome bonus!!`
` And if she's even under the age of 20, I'd have to believe it was a blessing of God!!"`
`"Even if it were a strictly financial relationship!!`
` But, if there's even love on top of that, it would be MOST SUPREME!!"`
`"And in the one in a million chance she had all three of the major attributes, 'spoiled child,' 'tsundere,' and 'surprisingly homely,' then I could fight against the whole world for her!!"`
`"...Of course, let's also consider 'yandere' for a bit. That added in under the right conditions would be a FLAWLESS VICTORY!!!"`
`*pop*`
`"...Yes. To have a person like that... standing by my side as I rest after a long day of work like today."`
`"And then, gently setting a cup of earl grey tea down on my desk...`
` Well, darjeeling or instant would be fine too, but for the sake of establishing the mood, let's just assume it's earl grey."`
`"Then, the faint sound of a clattering teacup would cause me to open my eyes and look back, and then...`
` '...You worked so hard again today.`
` The taste may be nothing special, but please do enjoy it... Master.'"`
`"Just a hint of embarrassment on her cheeks as she holds out the round tray in both hands and smiles at me."`
`"In that moment, if she shyly hid the bottom of her face with the tray, it would be so powerful!!`
` I needn't say anything more!!"`
`"...And then, I'd respond: `
` 'Wow, thanks as always.`
` How could anything you made for me not be delicious.`
` Mmm... yes, it's lovely.`
` It's healing all my fatigue of the day...'"`
`"And then, with a slightly coolu,`
` I mean, a slightly cool smile, and a look on her face that evokes blooming flowers, she'll respond 'I'm glad...' Yes, what a delightful day that would be!!"`
`"My HEART will be SCRAMBLED by FIERY HEAT to MAXIMUM BEAT!!"`
`"To overcome the huge barrier in the large status and age difference between us, the two of us would TAKE OFF in a dazzling frenzy, the Bullfight of Love!!"`
`"Yes, great, fantastic!`
` With this love behind me, even facing the great king of terror Angolmois from the prophecy of Nostradamus would be nothiiiing!!"`
`*pop* *pop*`
`"...Haah, haah... I-I mustn't do this.`
` Apparently, I'm still a bit fatigued.`
` And why am I making such a commotion in a vacant clinic in the middle of the night...?"`
`"Haah~, but how joyous a day it would be if that dream ever came to fruition...`
` And... if that maid could be Satoko-chan, for example, it would be such a SUPER LUCKY STRIKE."`
`"Well... the original playboy, Hikaru Genji, is said to have taken five years to turn Lady Murasaki into his bride, so I ought to follow in the footsteps of my predecessors. `
`Hmmm? I've already been acquainted with her for almost three years now, so just two more years and..."`
`"...Here you go, Coach."`
`"...Eeeeeeeek?!"`
`He couldn't help but be shocked. Without warning, a cup clattered as it was sat down on his desk. He smelled the aroma of tea as he turned around to find Rena standing there.`
`What's more, she was silently 'smiling,' here in this silent clinic late at night.`
`How frightening, too frightening...!!`
`"I-i-i-i-is something the matter, Ryuugu-san?!`
` H-h-h-h-how long have you been there, anyway?!"`
`"...Hau.`
` Right around the time you said 'You worked so hard again today' and started going into a monologue, I think... I think."`
`"E-eeeeeep?!"`
`The joyful delusions of a moment ago were blown away in one fell swoop, as aristocratic bachelor (age undisclosed) Kyousuke Irie was beaten down to despair as deep as the Mariana Trench.`
`Because if what Rena said was true... then she'd heard his wild fantasies almost in their entirety.`
`And... of all people to hear it, it had to be Satoko's friend, Rena Ryuugu!!`
`Naturally, it was easy to imagine that the explosive, full-blown delusional story he'd just uttered would reach Satoko's ears come tomorrow, and the result would be...`
`"...Coach!`
` I can't believe you had such obscene desires for me... You're despicable! I was wrong about you!`
` Please, I don't want to see your face ever again!!"`
`"U-uooooooohhhh?!`
` I-it's not like that, it's not like that, Satoko-chaaaan!!`
` I mean, Ryuugu-san!!"`
`"Th-th-th-that story you heard just now was just something I blurted out because I was tired, it's a recreational activity, a means of getting a little stress relief!!"`
`"I-I swear, by heaven and earth, that I do not hold such insolent desires every day!!`
` S-so, umm...!!"`
`"...Hey, Coach."`
`"Y-yes?!"`
`"Your tea... is getting cold.`
` So please... have some while it's still warm."`
`"Huh? Oh, o-of course...`
` Th-thank you for the tea..."`
`For a moment he wondered if it might be laced with some anesthetic, as he grabbed the cup and cautiously took a sip.`
`...The distinct floral aroma of earl grey tickled his nose, and the faintly sour taste caressed his tongue.`
`"...H-how is it?"`
`"O-oh my... isn't that delicious?`
` Yes, Ryuugu-san, you're quite good at brewing tea..."`
`...To tell the truth, she didn't have time to taste it herself.`
`But Rena smiled in glee as soon as she heard that.`
`"Hau, I'm glad...`
` Hey, umm... Coach?"`
`"Y-yes? What is it...?"`
`Whether it was an effect of the tea or his dignity as an adult, he'd calmed down a bit and drank the tea while maintaining his composure... with cold sweat on his back, he turned his swivel chair around toward Rena.`
`Rena turned her gaze down and her eyes wandered for a while, like she was hesitating... but eventually, she looked up like she'd made up her mind, her eyes moist as she spoke up.`
`"...Umm, would Rena be no good?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Couldn't Rena be your ideal maid?`
` Could I not serve as your maid, Coach?"`
`Pfffffft!!`
`An artistic spatter of tea danced around the clinic, in a manner that couldn't be repeated even if he tried.`
`"*cough* *cough*`
` R-Ryuugu-san?!`
` Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden?!"`
`"...Hau.`
` Coach, I'm well aware of the depth of your feelings for Satoko-chan.`
` But when it comes to feelings for you, Rena won't lose to anyone!`
` So please, let me be your dedicated maid!"`
`"H-h-hold on a minute, Ryuugu-san?!`
` I-if this is a joke, there's a better time and place to..."`
`"This is no joke!`
` These are Rena's true feelings... Master!!"`
`"...?!"`
`Master...`
`Master......`
`Master......?!`
`Ka-shiiiing☆`
`Like a bolt of lightning, a shiver ran from the top of his head down to his toes... His whole body stiffened like he was frozen in place. And then,`
`"Ryuugu-san.`
` Oh my... I, too, thought I'd reached a certain stage in maid-craft, and took pride in it.`
` Yet... that was but an illusion.`
` It was so terribly conceited of me. In my hubris I didn't realize my place!!"`
`"...Hau?"`
`Drip, drip...`
`With profusely streaming tears demonstrating his intensely burning pain, he shook his fist and roared toward the heavens!`
`"'Master'... That has such a sweet sound to it!!`
` It's not at all how I pictured it in my imagination, it's far too different!!"`
`"Yes! Sweetness like the song of the sirens that bewitch sailors!!`
` Beauty like the snow fairy beckoning mountaineers into a trance in a snowy mountain blizzard!! `
`In the face of that one word, thousands, tens of thousands of words would not be enough to adequately describe it!!"`
`"They say seeing is believing, but the world I knew was too small! Far too small!!`
` I was truly nothing but a frog in a well!!`
` Whoooaaaaa!!"`
`In that last roar, he was no longer even speaking words.`
`...But why were both of his examples monsters? Both of those creatures are quick to kill their targets.`
`"So, would you like Rena to be your maid?"`
`"...Huh?!`
` W-well, uhh..."`
`"Please!`
` I'll give it my all at cooking, laundry, cleaning, everything!"`
`"I can't yet do things without explicit instructions from you, but I'm sure someday I'll become a Super Maid who can understand your intentions based on just a snap of your fingers!!"`
`"So please, let me serve you... Master♪."`
`"Nwaaah?!"`
`Of course this was extreme, but he was trying to exercise some control as an adult.`
`But, with just a slight tilt of Rena's head,`
`Her cheeks slightly tinted with embarrassment, peeking up at him from below and smiling, from such a close distance!!`
`...It was as if his reason as an adult was held together by something as thin as a spider's thread, and that moment, `
`*snap*`
`It was cut...!!`
`"V... very well, Ryuugu-san!`
` I'm a man after all, let me show you the strength of my resolve!!"`
`"Who cares about age gaps! Who cares about the law!!`
` Those things will change with the times, those are armchair theories that will one day be done away with!! `
`I, Kyousuke Irie... dare to wave the anti-establishment flag and make the whole world my enemyyy!!"`
`"Th... thank you very much, Master!!"`
`"...But, Ryuugu-san.`
` Even so, the way of the maid is a very harsh world.`
` It's full of never-ending pain and hardship."`
`"And as soon as you step into that world, you'll be cut off from the earthly life you'd been living before.`
` Are you prepared for that? `
`Don't you have any lingering regrets about leaving behind the people close to you?"`
`"No, I don't!`
` If it's for my master's sake... come hell and high water, I'd cross it all with a smile on my face!!"`
`"O-ohhhhhhh!!`
` Well said... Well said!!`
` There is nothing left for me to teach you!!"`
`No, you didn't teach her anything in the first place.`
`"All right then, let's hurry and choose an outfit for you from my collection!`
` I've amassed a collection of various sizes from small to XL just in case of a situation like this, my secret treasures..."`
`"Hooooold uuuup!!"`
`Just then, we club member arrived!`
`"All right!`
` She hasn't gotten changed into a maid outfit yet!`
` Now's our chance!!"`
`"Wh-what are all of you doing here?`
` Some sudden onset of illness this late at night??"`
`"If anyone here is sick, it's you, Coach!!`
` Just what on earth were you trying to get Rena-san to do?!"`
`"S-Satoko-chan, this is a misunderstanding!`
` I swear, by heaven and earth, I would never coerce a girl into something disgraceful!!"`
`"...Hearing you say that with a maid outfit in hand and staring down your nose at her, it's not convincing at all."`
`"Rika-chama, please contact the police.`
` Report it as a kidnapping, or something!!"`
`"And before that, I'll get Rena away from him!!`
` Coach, brace yourseeelf~!"`
`"Hau~, don't do terrible things to my master~!!"`
`"Puberabagegyoh?!"`
`Mion carelessly approached, but Rena's punches took her down in a flash!!`
`"S-Sis...`
` Even after all the hits you took this afternoon and evening, you still haven't learned your lesson?`
` This is going to keep happening if you step in unprepared..."`
`"...S-sorry.`
` This ol' man got careless..."`
`"...Anyway, Rena is pretty amazing.`
` She can really do anything for the person she loves.`
` First photography, then yuri, now maids.`
` It's seriously terrifying..."`
`"The word 'impossible' isn't in her kyute mode's dictionary...`
` Even during club, none of us have as many ups and downs as she does."`
`"...You're right.`
` Her results after she's exploded and when she hasn't are strikingly different..."`
`"Anyway, let's leave Coach to the police.`
` ...More importantly, Rika-chama!`
` We have it this time, right?!"`
`"Meep! There's no doubt!`
` Irie is carrying it right now!"`
`"Wh-what's that, Rika-san?`
` I have something?"`
`"...Irie, please answer me honestly.`
` Did you happen to pick up a white magatama in Hinamizawa, or rather, a white key ring with a seal on it?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, yes, I believe I did.`
` I remember... I figured I'd bring it to the police, but I forgot!`
` If I don't bring it there, that'd be misappropriation, you know."`
`"That belongs to Rika!`
` Please return it at once!!"`
`"That's right!`
` That magatama is the reason Rena's acting like this!`
` We'll turn her back to normal, so please give it back!"`
`"Ah, you idiot, what are you...?!"`
`"Wh-whaaaaaaaat?!"`
`"...Yes, I see, so that's how it was...`
` Even though I was so sure I'd met my ideal woman, awakened to the wonders of being a maid..."`
`"So, Rena-san will go home if I give you back this key ring, is that what you're saying?`
` ...No! That won't do!`
` For the sake of my inner self, I need Rena-san's help to make the world of maids a reality!"`
`"Just a little longer, even if it takes just a century, I don't mind!`
` Please, allow me to bear witness to this wonderful dreeeam!!"`
`"How can anything take 'just' a century!`
` Everyone in here would be in our graves by then~!!"`
`"Please, Coach!`
` This isn't Rena's true intent, she's being manipulated!`
` Just play along, give us that fur seal you picked up and let Rena go!"`
`"...Maebara-san.`
` Even if her words were false, Ryuugu-san swore an oath to serve as my maid!"`
`"That is a binding contract, you could say!`
` In other words, the only way that condition can be overturned is if Rena-san herself declares it so!!"`
`"Th-this guy is such a pain...!`
` The way he's getting carried away and saying all these words I've never heard before, I'm about to faint~!!"`
`"...Rika?`
` What are you doing?"`
`"...Hello, police?`
` Please connect me to Ooishi.`
` ...Oh, this is Ooishi?`
` There's a pitiful man here who's been cursed by Oyashiro-sama.`
` He's beyond saving, so please arrest him immedia... Meep?`
` Meeeep?!"`
`The call suddenly cut off, and when Rika-chan looked up she was stunned, dumbfounded by the sight before her.`
`There stood Rena, grinning, having just cut the phone cord with a huge pair of scissors...!`
`"No way, NO WAY!!`
` I would never let the police take my master~!"`
`"...Wait, you just cut the phone line, won't that make work difficult for everyone at the clinic tomorrow?`
` Coach, is that really okay?"`
`"Yes, of course, I don't mind!!`
` I'm willing to toss my title and my livelihood down the drain if it's what it takes to make an ideal maid my own!!"`
`"...Maebara-san. A man's life is about romance!!`
` If all you care about is eating your daily bread, then what's even the point of being born into this world?!"`
`"...It sounds like a cool thing to say, but this guy is the epitome of a no-good adult."`
`"We can't let you do that!!`
` Rena asked us...`
` to save her!`
` And I promised to save Rena!`
` Give her back right now!!"`
`"Heh heh heh... it's a contest then, Maebara-san.`
` Well, just like how you all settle differences with your classroom club games, let's settle this here by your club rules!"`
`"...Although, it's already so late at night.`
` I'm sure all your parents will be worried if I keep you here any longer."`
`"Thus, let us meet tomorrow in front of the Okinomiya elementary school grounds, at 1 PM!!`
` Got it?!"`
`"Sure!!`
` ...But wait, why there?"`
`"Huh?`
` Wait, umm... No way, could it be...?"`
