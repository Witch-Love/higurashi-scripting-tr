`"..................u......`
` .........nn..."`
`"Hmm...?`
` Do you know who I am, Rika-chan?!"`
`"......Meep... Yes...`
` ......Where am I...?"`
`After hearing that answer, the nurse burst out of the room in sheer surprise.`
` ...How rude...`
`"Wh-Where's Dr. Irie?!`
` Call him at once!!`
` Tell him Rika-chan has come to!!"`
`............My head... hurts.`
`"...Oh, thank goodness, thank goodness!`
` Do you remember what happened?"`
`".........Meep.`
` ...Is this the clinic...?"`
`"Yes.`
` While you were heading back to Hinamizawa with your friends, you had an accident and hit your head, and never woke up again.`
` ...We feared your consciousness would never return.`
`...Thank goodness, oh, thank goodness..."`
`Irie even had a few tears in his eyes as he spoke.`
`...I was... still just a little scared.`
`I wanted to make sure this was the world I knew so well.`
` So I mustered my courage and asked Irie...`
`"Yes, all your friends were incredibly worried about you.`
` Satoko-chan, of course, and Maebara-kun, and Mion-san and Rena-san!`
`...Unfortunately, Satoshi-kun still hasn't reached a state where he can wake up yet."`
`"......And... my mother...?"`
`"............Your memories must still be a little confused.`
` That happens when you've been unconscious for a long time."`
`"......Is she dead?"`
`"...Yes. She died two years ago on the day of Watanagashi.`
` ......Were you dreaming of your mother while you were asleep?"`
`"...............Thank you.`
` I'm fine now."`
`Knowing that my mother is dead... gives me a complex feeling.`
`...But there wasn't any doubt that this was the world I knew so well.`
`...And according to Irie... it had been a little over a month since the accident.`
`After telling me he'd be right back, he scrambled out of the room.`
`Left in my hospital room filled with the voices of cicadas, I could do nothing but wander through my vague memories for a time...`
`...I was fooling around on my bike while heading home from playing at the pool with everyone...`
` ...and got hit by a car, right...?`
`But... The world I awoke to after that is still vivid in my mind.`
`...And if this is my original world......`
` then I...`
` after grappling with that difficult choice, I chose my old world... and safely ended my long journey to return to it...?`
`Or was... that all just a long dream I had, like Irie said, while I was in a coma from the accident?`
` ......I didn't know...`
`".........Hanyuu...`
` Are you there?"`
`"......Au."`
`"......That's good.`
` Waking up in that world and not seeing you straight away was really disheartening."`
`"Has something like that ever happened?`
` I've always been the first one you saw whenever you woke up, Rika."`
`Hanyuu speaks to me while wearing an affectionate expression.`
`...But her saying that at length just makes me remember the world of just a few moments ago.`
`Because for the first time, Hanyuu wasn't there when I woke up.`
`"......Hanyuu.`
` ...That world...`
` Was it a dream...?`
` Or...`
` was it real...?"`
`"...I don't really understand what you're saying, Rika.`
` Did something happen?"`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"...Rika, I don't understand what you're talking about."`
`"........."`
`Was Hanyuu playing dumb... or was she telling the truth? I couldn't tell.`
`"......Then... What was that world I was just in...?`
` A dream...?"`
`"A dream."`
`Hanyuu answered immediately.`
`...And hearing that convinced me.`
`......That sinless world was no dream.`
`"...Then.........`
` I......`
` killed her......`
` with my own hands.........?"`
`My mother had the Fragment.`
` ...I shouldn't have been able to return to my original world without killing her.`
`...If I was here, that meant I'd killed her.`
`And then, after I killed her... I had to kill myself, "like usual," to send myself to the world of the gods.`
`And... conveniently, when I die, it goes back through my memories right before the event and tears them apart.`
`So... it was only natural that... my memories of personally killing my mother didn't remain...`
`...Trembling, I looked at the palms of my hands...`
`They were pure white, pale and bloodless.`
`...No, that was just it...`
`...That alone made me remember the feeling, spread across my hands—that warm, sticky, slimy sensation......!`
`"...Ah... aaaahhhhhhhh!!!"`
`My Fragment welled up inside me.`
` Something inside me was desperately holding back the memories of that alien world.`
` Crying out for some reason, desperately holding them back.`
`Because if they spilled out, they would surely swallow me whole...!!`
`"...Rika.`
` You need to calm down."`
`"........."`
`Hanyuu put her hand to my forehead, and I felt as though something was grabbing my lungs in a fist.`
`A sense of suffocation, like something was squeezing the breath out of me...`
`But it was squeezing those feelings about to swallow me up, too, and they couldn't come up any further.`
`In exchange for the choking sensation, I gulped down the rising emotions, beginning to steadily regain my composure...`
`Hanyuu realized it, and took her hand away.`
`"......Ghah!!`
` Ergh, ghh!!`
` Hoo, hah... hah..."`
`"...Have you calmed down?`
` You were asleep for a long time, so you must be confused.`
` You should do as Irie says for a while—take your medicine and get some bedrest."`
`"...Ha... Hanyuu, wait, tell me!`
` Was that world..."`
`"...Look, everyone's arrived.`
` I'll only be in the way, so I'll disappear for a while."`
`"Hanyuu...!"`
`I started to hear many footsteps running down the hallway.`
`Hanyuu whirled around, as though pivoting on her heel, and vanished.`
`In exchange, the hospital door clattered violently open... and my beloved club member friends appeared.`
`"Rika!!`
` Riiikaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Satoko..."`
`"H-Hey, Satoko, Rika-chan just woke up. You shouldn't be hugging her..."`
`"It's okay, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Thank goodness, thank goodness..."`
`Clinging to me, Satoko fell to her knees on the spot, and started bawling without hesitation.`
`"...Welcome back, Rika-chan.`
` We had faith you'd come back to us."`
`"Yeah.`
` Because when we all believe in one thing, a miracle is sure to happen!`
` That's how we beat Takano-san in that crazy battle, right? Because we all believed in a miracle!"`
`"Everyone believed that you'd come back for sure, Rika-chan.`
` We came to visit every day.`
` We knew for sure you'd wake up, so we came every day... Oh, thank goodness..."`
`"Coach says your memories are a little bit muddled.`
` Y-You didn't forget about this old man and the rest of us, right?!"`
`"...I know who Satoko and Rena and Keiichi are, but I don't know who you are, Mii.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"Ahahahahaha. I guess you're all right."`
`...This was something I couldn't ever have asked before.`
`...But... Just to make absolutely sure this really was my original world...`
` I asked anyway, pretending my memory was still confused.`
`"...Is Satoshi......`
` not coming?"`
`Satoko gave a somewhat lonely smile and spoke.`
`"...Nii-nii still hasn't come back after running away two years ago, remember?`
` Rika, you can be so forgetful."`
`Her expression makes my chest tighten.`
` ...She was definitely the Satoko from my original world.`
`"I see...`
` Your memories do seem a little confused...`
` He said it wouldn't last, and that it was nothing to worry about. `
`It's the same as when you get a phone call that wakes you up, and say strange things while half-asleep."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I mean, you were sleeping in for almost a month, after all."`
`"...This whole month...... I felt like I was having a dream."`
`"Oh, having a fabulous time, I'm sure, in spite of how worried we were!"`
`".........It was... a very mysterious world, I think.`
` It was Hinamizawa, just like here......`
` but a bunch of things were different.`
` ...First of all, Keiichi wasn't here."`
`"Hey, what? Why'd you have to leave me out~?"`
`"Because in that world, the incident with the gun didn't happen.`
` ...In that world, you didn't have all those regrets.`
` ......No, that wasn't all it was."`
`...I realized this would be my only chance to confess to my own sin.`
`Everyone listened as I told them all about that world. Whenever some small thing was different, they'd respond one way or the other about it, but they listened to me seriously.`
`"......So the reason I'm here...`
` is because I weighed that world and this one......`
` and chose this world, I think."`
`"...You probably saw the other side of the river Styx.`
`Like a near-death experience!`
` If you had chosen that world... you probably wouldn't have come back here."`
`"...Yes, if I chose that one... I don't think I would have returned."`
`"We all believed you'd come back, Rika-chan.`
` And you believed it, too, so that means our hands reached each other.`
` ...I think you were doing your best to come back to us while you were asleep.`
` What a good girl."`
`Keiichi grinned and patted my head, but it seemed like he was mistaking what I meant.`
`...I hadn't "returned."`
`I'd compared that world and this one, and chosen this one.`
`Why had I chosen this world?`
`...Because this one was more comfortable to be in.`
`Satoko was always with me, everyone in the club was here, and they were nice to me and spoiled me.`
`But all that was still a world built on top of everyone's sins and misfortune.`
`In other words, I had chosen to sacrifice the others for my own happiness.`
` Shamelessly, self-centeredly, and selfishly.`
`Everyone was fulfilled in that world.`
` Only I wasn't.`
`But I knew that I, too, could be happy there if I put in the hard work.`
`But, but... At the very end... I had chosen this world.`
`I chose the world where I could rest on my laurels, atop the suffering and tears of my friends...`
`"...That sounds like a very interesting world.`
` Thank you.`
` You wanted us all to be happy, even if it was just a dream."`
`Rena smiled as she said that.`
`...Only she seemed to understand what I really meant by what I'd said.`
`"But, you know.`
` ...If I got the chance to choose between those two worlds...`
` I think this world would have been the right choice."`
`"...Wh... Why?"`
`"It's true that my mother's divorce was really sad for me.`
` It changed a lot, but thanks to that, I learned a lot, too.`
`So the Reina in the other world you talked about probably isn't as human as this Rena is. `
`...You thought I was an exemplary person even as Reina in your dream, but...`
` When I was actually Reina, I wasn't a very respectable person. `
`What I mean is, when my mother got divorced, it was really hard and sad for me...`
` but now I can accept it, since maybe it was just one of the trials a person has to go through in their life."`
`"...It's true that the trials of life, of failure, make a person grow."`
`"Yeah...`
` I get what Rena means too.`
` ...I didn't go to Hinamizawa in that world... but I was probably a total loser. `
`...I regret that incident more than anything I've ever done, and I won't forget it as long as I live.`
` I'll probably have to reflect on it until the day I die. `
`...But like Rena said, thanks to that incident, I learned a lot of important lessons.`
` Thinking about whether there was a world where I could make it so past incidents never happened...`
` might be attractive. `
`...But I don't think about that stuff.`
` I think they're all important foundations that pile up to make the Keiichi Maebara here today."`
`"...Oh, but that goes for me as well.`
` ...I was a spoiled child before, and I would have stayed that way as long as Nii-nii was here. `
`...Having a world where Nii-nii would never leave home is indeed an attractive invitation...`
` but staying with him and continuing to be a spoiled child would mean nothing.`
` ...So I would choose this world. `
`Because now, I can be proud of myself and wait for Nii-nii to return!"`
`"...............Do you...`
` all really think that?`
` ...I worried so much...`
` thinking I had to erase my sin...`
` and now you're rejecting the choice of a beautiful world where those sins don't exist...?"`
`"...Yep.`
` I think this world is more valuable."`
`"But why...?"`
`"...Because the future of this world was something we all worked together to achieve.`
` The people in that world were just idling their time away, right?"`
`"...Idling away... But is living without sin a sin in itself...?"`
`"It's not.`
` But this one is still more valuable.`
` ......I think the flowers that grow up in a greenhouse without difficulty are beautiful, sure... `
`But maybe wildflowers that withstand the rain and wind and heat and cold have something more to them than beauty.`
` ...I'm only talking about how important that is. `
`...Is there a reason to be ashamed of a beat-up wildflower?"`
`"...But if you asked it to choose whether to grow up in a greenhouse or a field..."`
`"Oh, I get it.`
` That's what you've been getting wrong all along, Rika-chan."`
`"......Meep...?"`
`"We're all wildflowers that sprouted in the field, aren't we?`
` Once you've bloomed, there's no point in comparing them to an impossible, imaginary future. `
`...Rika-chan, you're talking from the point of view of something higher than a flower. Something not human."`
`"..............."`
`"Which of those two worlds is happier?`
` The only ones that can debate that are the gods who can go between those worlds.`
` ...But for the human named Rika-chan, there's only one world.`
` Er, wait! `
`I mean, you're in both worlds, but you can't go between them.`
` The wildflower you and the greenhouse you both exist.`
` And I think both of them are living proudly, following the destiny of their worlds. `
`The wildflower saying things like 'I wouldn't have struggled with anything if I grew up in a greenhouse' doesn't make sense to begin with.`
` We're all flowers. `
`Wherever we plant our roots and sprout, we do our best to grow and bloom."`
`"Wishing you were born into a super-rich family is what losers say in their sleep!`
` If you have time to fantasize, you should start putting in effort and find a cheap supermarket so you can save up change!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Satoko is proud of herself, so even if there was a world where she was super-rich, I think you could compare them and not find either of them to be worse than the other."`
`"Well, I must say, if I had to choose, I'd prefer to be super-rich!"`
`"......I wonder, Rika-chan...`
` Are you still having second thoughts, even after waking up in this world...?`
` Like, whether this was really the right choice. `
`...Are you thinking that maybe the other one would have been good too...?"`
`...Those words were probably the root of these cheerless feelings.`
`I... love this world.`
`...But I couldn't help but be troubled given the depth of my own sin, of abandoning that world and insisting everyone else be sinners.`
`...Shouldn't I have chosen that world for the sake of everyone I loved?`
`They've unanimously decided this world was better, but in a way, it was just acceptance, since they hadn't been granted the choice of selecting one of the two.`
`...That was why everyone thought positively and went with this world.`
`If they could have actually chosen, they'd all be conflicted too...`
`"......It must be hard.`
` ...So that's why... the sadness deep down won't heal, Rika-chan..."`
`And yet... only Rena seemed to have figured everything out.`
`"I know! I'll explain it to you like a game, so that you can understand too, Rika-chan.`
` Mii-chan, you brought candy with you today, right?"`
`"Huh?`
` Sure, why?"`
`What was she going to do...?`
`Then, Rena grabbed it with both her hands and stuck them out toward me.`
`"Here, Rika-chan, it's a present!`
` I wonder which of these hands is better? Which is?"`
`"......Meep. You won't make me play a punishment game if I guess wrong, will you?"`
`"Hau~ There's nothing like that.`
` Don't worry, just choose."`
`...Even considering how we usually did club games, there really were no hints at all.`
`I looked at the size of Rena's fists, but I couldn't begin to guess which had the candy in it.`
`......Oh, whatever.`
` Time to test my luck!`
`"Then... I choose this fist."`
`"This one?`
` Here."`
`Rena opened her fist and revealed candy.`
` I must have made the right choice.`
`"Ahaha, congratulations!`
` Here, say ahhh☆"`
`"...Ahhh☆"`
`"Is it good?"`
`It was the standard but nostalgic taste of strawberry milk.`
`As it shrunk as I rolled it around in my mouth and sucked on it, I couldn't help but give a smile.`
`"...It's good.`
` Nipah."`
`"Are you happy?`
` Then Rika-chan's world is happy."`
`"...I'm really happy that I won your choice game.`
` Victory is sweet."`
`"Hey, Rika-chan.`
` Why do you think you won?"`
`"...Meep?"`
`Rena showed me her other palm, the one I didn't choose.`
`"...............Ah."`
`In her hand... she was holding two pieces of candy.`
`In other words... the one I chose... was wrong.`
`At that moment... and this was really obvious... but I immediately realized how merry I had been feeling.`
`"...That feeling right now is close to how you're feeling about this, isn't it?"`
`..................`
`"As soon as you compare different worlds, you're already overstepping your bounds as a person.`
` It's God's job to worry over which is better.`
` Not ours. `
`We only ever have one world given to us, and we're made so that we can find happiness in it.`
` ...In your dream, Rika-chan, you were a god who could go between two worlds, which made you feel like that. `
`But you can't worry about what was in my other hand."`
`I was... a witch, who had lived a hundred years in countless worlds.`
`That was exactly why I'd always believed I was special, someone who would overcome millions of choices to gain happiness—that I was able to gain happiness, that I was sure to.`
`......But...`
` I had it completely backwards.`
`...I... wasn't any better than anyone else.`
` ...When it came to finding happiness, I was the worst of them all...`
`Then... I remembered how Hanyuu had so curtly and quickly told me the other world was a dream.`
`......It wasn't a dream.`
`But... now that I'd chosen, this was reality, and that really was nothing more than a dream.`
`When a cat is in a box, you can imagine two futures: one where it's alive, and one where it's dead.`
`But when you open it, there's only one future.`
`The other future, at that moment, becomes no more than a dream.`
`The one who opens it accepts the future inside, and lives.`
`Worrying about which of the two futures in the box was better was a job for those who weren't human, those who could interfere with the contents.`
`...As a mere human being, I had awkwardly trodden in the world of the gods, which was why I'd misunderstood some important things, wasn't it?`
`In that world, Hanyuu had regrets.`
`...She regretted having used the power of the gods to interfere with my life.`
`......And now, I finally understood why.`
`She was quite clear about it.`
`She clearly said that people had to live the best they could in their world.`
`......I had to... stop being this witch.`
`Yes.`
` ...I knew now that I was not the witch named Bernkastel... but Rika Furude.`
`My copy had lived for a hundred years, bending fate to her whim, and maybe she still exists in some higher dimension than this human world.`
`But that was no longer who I was.`
`I was... Rika Furude.`
`In this world, I would live, and in this world, I would seize happiness.`
`I mustn't use that power ever again.`
`Which meant, I had to make sure not to treat my own life without respect from now on, which meant...`
`"...Guess I should be more careful about traffic accidents..."`
`"Huh?`
`...Hahahaha!`
` You're right, hahahaha!"`
`"H-Hau~!`
`You're right!`
` Never mess around while riding your bike again!!"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...You are absolutely right.`
` ......Children who don't know something that obvious have no right to pretend to be witches.`
` It doesn't make a lick of sense."`
`"All right, everyone, let's leave things at that for today.`
` Rika-chan is still very weak right now.`
` You can all come visit again tomorrow, so let's let her have some rest."`
`Coach appeared and clapped his hands together, but my friends weren't finished saying good-bye just yet.`
`"......Rika.`
` Are you all right now...?"`
`"...Thank you.`
` Rena explained everything to me better than your tied-up tongue ever could.`
` ...I'm okay now."`
`"...The next time you lose your life...`
` I'll have to accept that fate."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I think I'm fine with that too.`
` Children who mess around in the road get hit by cars every day in Japan.`
` ...It just happened to occur in Hinamizawa, too. `
`...If I have something to be frustrated about, it's not crossing the road on a red light from now on.`
` ...But are you okay with that?`
` ...You used to throw tantrums about how lonely you'd be without me."`
`"...I'm all right now.`
` I made a very important friend."`
`"Really?`
` Who is it? Introduce me."`
`"......I'm not telling.`
` Au au."`
`"...I see.`
` ...That means...`
` I'm...`
` 'Rika Furude'...`
` right?"`
`"If you think so, Rika, then you are."`
`"........................Thank you."`
`"...Thank you for what?"`
`"......A bunch of things."`
`After Irie admonished everyone else, they all glumly got ready to go home.`
`Hanyuu, too, was about to disappear.`
`But I clapped my fist into my hand, as if remembering something, and spoke to her.`
`"...Hey, Hanyuu!"`
`"What is it?"`
`"...In that other world, I promised I'd fill the refrigerator with cream puffs once I returned to my original world.`
` ...But that was a dream, so I can forget about it, right?"`
`"Au!`
` ...Uuu... Uguu."`
`"...You're breaking character."`
`"Rikaaa!`
` I'll bring you something tomorrow when we visit!`
` Is there anything you want to eat?!"`
`"Rika-chan likes spicy things, doesn't she?`
` She likes going to the Korean food fair at the department store in Gogura, doesn't she?`
` I wonder if they sell super-hot kimchi there?"`
`"Au!!`
` Au au au au au au au!!"`
`"...I want something sweet."`
`"Sweet?`
` Okay, what kind?!"`
`"Then let's all go buy a shortcake!`
` The ones at Angel Mort are especially delicious!"`
`"...Then I'll go with some cream puffs from Angel Mort.`
` ...Cheap ones are fine, I just want to eat a lot."`
`"It's a good thing you're energetic enough to eat.`
` It doesn't matter what kind of food; if you eat a lot, you'll be back to normal.`
` Now then, everyone, visiting hours are over."`
`Everyone began to leave.`
` Hanyuu, too.`
`"...Now we're even, right?"`
`"I didn't do you any favors."`
`"......Right.`
` That was a dream, after all."`
`"Good night, Rika.`
` Sweet dreams."`
`Good night, Rika Furude.`
`And please, treat the future you won with care...`
`...Thank you.`
`Oh, right.`
` ...After I get out... the first thing I'll do is go visit my parents' grave.`
`......I realized something just now.`
` Why I had to kill my mother to return to this world.`
`The Fragment coming out when I killed her or whatever wasn't the problem.`
`...Choosing a world in which my mother wasn't here was already killing her.`
`Until now, I'd chosen this world without feeling any sorrow for it,`
` for "killing my mother every time."`
`...That was what you wanted me to realize, wasn't it...?`
`The sins you feel in me.`
`...That's probably one of them.`
`...I'd stopped respecting my parents.`
`And I finally realized that in the other world.`
`Rika.`
` Thank you... for realizing.`
`I feel as though the most important sin I felt from you has been cleansed...`
`It'll be okay, Rika.`
`Your hands are not stained with your mother's blood.`
`That was all... something I showed you because I wanted to be mean to you for a little...`
` All just a dream.`
`...May you forget all of it when you awaken from your slumber.`
`Good night,`
` ...Rika.`
`Sleep deep...`
` sleep deep.`
`As I dream of how you will color your life in the future...`
