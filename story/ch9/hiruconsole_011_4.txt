`"All right... I'll leave it to you, Satoko!`
` Oh, but are we allowed to switch hitters in the middle of the game?"`
`I felt a little anxious about it, so I ran the suggestion by Coach and Rena. But since they were in such a strong lead, they gave the okay immediately.`
`"Yes, yes! Of course that's okay!"`
`"Aaah... to have Ryuugu-san and Satoko-chan fighting over my exclusive maid position...!`
` Truly a sad, lamentable showdown..."`
`"But this is a tragedy born from my own charm!!`
` Aaah, I hate myself!! I hate so much that I can't stop these two beautiful girls from being attracted to me!!" `
`"...Actually, I feel like I'm going to have a seizure just looking at you.`
` Perhaps I should just wallop him and take the problem out from the source?"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` The stronger the foe the greater the value in victory~!`
` No matter what you're planning, I don't mind.`
` In the end, Rena and Master will be the ones to come out victorious, after all~?"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` Be cocky while you still can~.`
` Now, gaze upon my true power!!"`
`*craaaack*`
`"R-ridiculous...?!"`
`This time, Kameda-kun fell to his knees and collapsed right there on the mound.`
`Rena's third hit of the day arched toward center field and then disappeared.`
`"S-Satoko...!"`
`"Please trust me on this.`
` Because for now, our top priority is to win back at least one point."`
`And then, Satoko stepped up to the plate.`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Satoko-chan, are you prepared?`
` Rena won't show any mercy, not even for you, all right?"`
`"Yes, of course~.`
` The stronger the foe, the more I'm itching to put my skills to use!"`
`"Aahahahaha, you've got a lot of nerve!`
` All right then, let's go!!"`
`"Oh, by the way, Rena-san.`
` ...Be mindful of the tells your pitching arm makes when you're throwing a slider!"`
`"Huh...?!"`
`Rena, was already in the middle of setting up her throw, but that one comment from Satoko had her eyes open wide in bewilderment.`
`But it was too late to change her course, so she released the ball in a visibly clumsy throw, and...`
`"...Ah?!"`
`"...Heh.`
` Piece of cake!!"`
`*craaaack*`
`Naturally, Satoko wasn't about to overlook a careless mis-thrown pitch, and swung her bat.`
`The ball vigorously arced upward and soared high in the sky, then disappeared in the direction of left field.`
`"A-all riiiiight!!`
` Nice hit, Satoko! I knew you could do it!!"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` Exactly as planned!!"`
`Okay... the score's now 3 to 1!`
`It's a disadvantage, of course, but it's a huge step up from the psychological pressure of having 0 points!`
`"H...how exquisite!!"`
`"Ah, hold on, Tomita-kun.`
` Don't worry about fetching the ball, go get the camera out of my bag!!"`
`I looked on... feeling sorry for him for being unreasonably ordered around, but Tomita-kun responded "Yes sir!!" with a twinkle in his eye, then charged toward the third base bench.`
`Hey, Coach, Tomita-kun... we all came here to play baseball, right?`
`"...Rgh!"`
`*tiiiing*`
`"Aaah...?!"`
`Maybe Rena was still upset about giving up a hit and it was dragging her down, but she hit the ball off center and it resulted in an infield pop fly.`
`And then, for Satoko's second at-bat...`
`"...I got careless, Satoko-chan.`
` But how's it gonna go next time...?!"`
`Then, Rena put all her strength into her arm as she raised it, and with the full force of her body, swung her arm through the air!`
`It was the fastest pitch I'd ever seen, heading toward Satoko's inside corner!`
`However...`
`"...If it's just fast, I can handle that no problem!!"`
`*craaaack*`
`"Wh-whoooaaaaaa!!`
` I-incredible, Satoko!`
` Two homers in a roooow!!"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` The difference in arm strength can be covered by getting a good read on the pitch!!"`
`...Attagirl, Satoko!`
`She must've known that Rena was frustrated by Satoko pointing out her slider quirk and giving up a hit, and predicted that she'd come in with a fastball this time!`
`"Ohhh! Ohhhhhhhh!!`
` Marvelous, simply marvelous, Satoko-chan!!`
` Please, join us on the Hinamizawa Fighters. You can be batter number four starting in our very next game!!"`
`"...Master?"`
`"...Huh?!`
` Oh, please excuse me, Rena-san.`
` The competition here is ruthless, so please get fired up and give it everything you've got!!"`
`"Yes, Master!!"`
`"Okay, the score's now 3 to 2!`
` ...I should follow Satoko's lead and help out too.`
` Heeeey, Kameda-kuuun?"`
`"...Fweh...?"`
`Mion called out to Kameda-kun, whose pride and self-confidence were now completely shattered, and was now in a completely dazed, burned-out state. And then, she whispered something or other into his ear...`
`"...R-really?!`
` If that's true, you're my angel!!"`
`"Yeah, but I'd rather you not call me 'my angel' though..."`
`"Anyway, it's a promise.`
` So cheer up, get out there, and give it everything you've got!!"`
`"Y-yeaaaahhhh!!`
` I can do it! I'm gonna do it!!"`
`"I'm about to turn this into a bloodbath!!`
` I'll cut down any person that crosses my path!!`
` Any demon too!!`
` The fate of the Empire depends on this maaatch!!"`
`After hearing that, the emaciation Kameda-kun had been feeling a moment ago disappeared, and he stepped up to the mound with an aura of intense flames emanating from his back. `
`Then, he turned toward Rena, who was smiling calmly in the batter's box. He carefully dusted his hands with the non-slip powder, and then tightened his grip on the ball.`
`"...What's this?`
` What happened to you underdogs?`
` But, even if you're suddenly full of energy... that won't change the outcome here, you know?"`
`"Heh, heheheh...!`
` Sorry, miss.`
` The man I was a moment ago... just died!"`
`"And now, I stand here reborn, as NEW KAMEDA!!`
` Completely different from who I was before!!"`
`Then, Kameda-kun raised his leg up to the sky, in a throwing form like he was thrusting it up toward the heavens... and stepped forward with tremendous vigor, throwing a fastball with all his weight and all his spirit behind it!!`
`"Uoooooooo!!`
` Here is my soul!! Eat thiiiiis!!!"`
`"...Rgh?!"`
`The force of the pitch was so strong not even Rena could hit it back, but she swung the bat with all her might.`
`...She weakly batted it back, and the ball rolled through the infield before coming to a stop.`
`"H-hey, Mion...`
` Just what did you tell Kameda-kun?"`
`"Hmm, nothing much.`
` I just offered him a deal, that at the next Dessert Fest he could have one item from the special menu for every ball he manages to deny Rena.`
` ...But wow, was that effective."`
`"I-I see..."`
`That's Mion for you, nice strategy...`
`......`
`...`
`And so, the desperate struggle between Rena and Satoko continued, with the score still 3 to 2.`
`And then, for Rena's final at-bat...!`
`*craaaack*`
`It had been a while since we heard the pleasant sound of a Rena batted ball echoing all around, but the hit was just slightly off, and it plopped down just shy of the home run zone.`
`So in the end, Rena scored three home runs.`
`Considering she was going head-to-head with a Koshien class ace pitcher, it was truly an accomplishment`
`"...Which means, if Satoko can hit a home run in her next at-bat, we'll be going into extra innings.`
` You can do it, Satoko."`
`"...Satoko?"`
`"...Uu..."`
`Noticing Satoko grimacing in pain, we all rushed over.`
`"Satoko, what's wrong?"`
`"I'm sorry... I made a bit of a blunder."`
`Satoko bitterly smiled, and held out her right hand for us to see.`
`Looking closely, the nail of her index finger was stained reddish-black, like it was bleeding internally...`
`"...?! Satoko, you're hurt!!"`
`"Oh no... This is awful.`
` Coach, come over here a sec!"`
`Coach was in the middle of wiping the dirt off the home plate, when Mion called out to him in a panic.`
`He recognized the situation, immediately rushed over with a first aid kit, sat Satoko down on a bench, and began administering treatment.`
`"The ball must've struck your finger when you hit that foul tip earlier.`
` We need to get you to the clinic, right away.`
` We can take my car."`
`"I-I'm all right.`
` This is no big deal..."`
`Satoko stout-heartedly clutched the bat and tried heading out toward the batter's box.`
`But before she could, Rika-chan cut in front of her and held out a hand to stop her.`
`"Satoko, you did a great job.`
` That's enough, you don't need to keep going."`
`"...That won't do!`
` If we don't win this game, Rena-san will be stuck this way forever, you know?`
` We have to do this! No, I have to do this!"`
`"S-Satoko-chan... that's enough.`
` I admit defeat. I'll give this magatama back to all of you.`
` I was just trying to have fun. I'm sorry for getting you all involved in this foolish game..."`
`"...Foolish game?"`
`"Coach, Rena-san is taking this game very seriously! That's disrespectful to her!`
` At the very least, she wouldn't feel that way about it!"`
`Satoko glared back at Coach, admonishing him for what he'd carelessly said.`
`"Satoko..."`
`"...To be honest, at first I felt that the way Rena-san was acting was foolish, so I poked fun at her."`
`"But somewhere along the way, I sort of became impressed.`
` Even if it's due to the effect of the magatama, seeing Rena-san get so serious for the sake of someone she loves is actually quite amazing."`
`"So, I thought it would be disrespectful not to confront Rena-san's passionate thoughts head-on..." `
`...Come to think of it, when Satoko first took over for me she was trying to upset Rena with bluffing and psychological attacks... but somewhere along the way, she began competing in earnest, without resorting to underhanded tactics.`
`Maybe confronting her directly allowed Satoko to feel the strength of Rena's heart more than anyone else...`
`I know the basic rules of baseball since we've done it as a club activity, but there's no way I'd have the strength to compete with a pitcher that's famous even at the Koshien level.`
`...And yet, thanks to that Magatama of Fuwarazu and her love for Coach, she even studied magic pitches and caught up to Kameda-kun's skill level, all to ensure victory for Coach.`
`"...Meep.`
` Rena has surprisingly terrifying latent abilities..."`
`"This incident has proven beyond a doubt that Rena is incredible!"`
`"Yeah... This ol' man thinks she's pretty good."`
`"She's more than pretty good!`
` Even without Magatama of Fuwarazu, Rena still has the ability to compete at Koshien!"`
`"Ah, that's not what I meant."`
`"...I was just thinking, well, that trying to match her tastes to the one she likes and putting all of her effort into it is praiseworthy itself."`
`"When you start to like someone, the first thing you'd do is try and pull them into your own world, right?`
` You'd try and get them to like the things you like."`
`"...Isn't that the normal thing to do?"`
`"That's what I would do.`
` There's probably more of us than you think."`
`"...But Rena's different.`
` Whether it's Tomitake-san, or Takano-san, or Coach.`
` She tried her very best to match herself to their interests."`
`"Her willingness to adapt to her partner is crazy, of course, but I'm not surprised about that as much as I am about how much effort she poured into it."`
`"Maybe so...`
` All that work matching yourself to them would be exhausting, wouldn't it...?"`
`"Right?`
` Maybe pulling someone into your own world means tiring them out."`
`"So if you were a good couple from the start, you'd both have to step into the other's world to an extent."`
`"...But not many people try to meet them halfway without being asked.`
` Everyone else tries to make the other person step into their own footprint, but don't make the effort to step into the other's."`
`...For some reason, Mion's uncharacteristic musing hurt a little.`
`"...I understand what you mean.`
` I think I always pulled others in, and never tried to step into their world."`
`"...That probably goes for Satoko, too.`
` And Mii."`
`"...By the way, Mii, you never let anyone who asked into the club, but you actually approached Keiichi yourself, didn't you?"`
`"Uh, huh?!`
` Ah, aha ha ha, did I?!`
` Well, err, there were no ulterior motives there, aha ha ha ha, this ol' man doesn't know what you mean~!"`
`"...You blockhead."`
`...If there was anything this incident taught me. ...It was that Rena would be a great wife in the future.`
`"...Which means we have to settle this match as soon as we can and get Rena back into her right mind."`
`After saying that, Rika-chan turned back toward Rena on the pitcher's mound.`
`Rena had been serving as both the batter and the pitcher, so as you'd expect, she looked rather tired, but her eyes alone still had power to them, overflowing with fighting spirit to seize victory.`
`"...Keiichi.`
` ...We all know now how good a person Rena really is.`
` ...So, let's...`
` end this farce."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I don't know what kind of love she'll have or what kind of person she'll marry.`
` ...But that's for Rena to decide.`
` ...She doesn't need any creepy magic to help her out!"`
`Of course, some might want to borrow that magic's strength, but others would create their own destiny without relying on another's power. ...Rena was obviously the latter sort.`
`Well... There is no former or latter.`
`Everyone wants to create their own destiny, with their own strength.`
`When you start thinking that some people can do that but others can't, it's like admitting to yourself that you're one of the ones who can't do it.`
`...Rena's force of will seemed divine.`
`The way she kept on smiling despite her exhaustion, she looked so noble.`
`The lesson that Rena demonstrated in her short life is precious, and something we must never forget.`
`So, I think that broad smile of Rena's was only for the person she had truly decided on, from the bottom of her heart...`
`"All right, Kei-chan, we're entrusting everything to you.`
` ...So, you better live up to our expectations!"`
`"...Yeah!`
` All right Satoko, swap me in!`
` It was my role in the first place, so I'll be sure to honor the thoughts you put into it!"`
`"Keiichi-san..."`
`Satoko stared hard at me for a while, like she was trying to gauge my true intentions. And then,`
`"...All right Keiichi-san, please go right ahead!`
` At least use your last at-bat to even the score, and drive this into extra innings!"`
`"Yeaah!`
` Leave it to me!!"`
`I grabbed the bat from Satoko, then walked over to the batter's box.`
`Then I turned toward Rena, who was drenched in sweat and panting heavily, and I put strength into my grip as I donned a batting stance.`
`"All right, Rena!`
` For better or worse, this is our final at-bat!`
` Fastball, curveball, give me anything you got!!"`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` So you're the last hitter after all, Keiichi-kun.`
` It was annoying that things didn't quite play out the way I expected, but...`
` but it was a lot of fun."`
`"So, here it is, the final pitch!`
` No more cheap tricks, this is a head-on contest!!"`
`"Yeah!!`
` All right, bring it oooon!!"`
`......`
`Rena put every ounce of strength in her body into a fastball.`
`And I responded with a full force swing, with all my might.`
`...Then, the ball coasted somewhere deep beyond the outfield...`
`"...And so,`
` the final score in this home run derby is 3 to 3. A draw!`
` However, Ryuugu-san agreed to concede, so the club team claims victory!!"`
`"Allll riiiiight!!"`
`...In contrast to our triumphant victory shout, Rena dejectedly hung her head.`
`That last pitch Rena threw to me... literally had all of Rena's strength poured into a single throw.`
`After she finished the pitch, she knelt down on the mound like she had no strength left in her...`
`Nevertheless, she still tried to stand back up like she wanted to continue the fight, but Coach couldn't bear to see it, so he gave Rena a final "order from her master" telling her to give up.`
`"Aaaahhhhh... Hau... We loooost..."`
`"No, no!`
` We may have lost the match, but Rena-san, you put up a wonderful fight, all on your own!`
` If the other team had to fight under the same conditions, we would have won by a landslide!"`
`"No, in this case, winning or losing doesn't matter.`
` It was a truly wonderful contest, and for me, it was the most rewarding experience ever!"`
`"It's a shame to lose such a precious maid, but this only strengthens my ambition to make the Maid-ification Project a reality!!`
` Ryuugu-san, thank you for this LOVELY DREAM!!"`
`"...Hau...`
` ...Okaaay..."`
`"We won the game, but I feel like we've lost something else."`
`"...Heh heh. We'll chalk it up to Rena being amazing.`
` ...*yaaaaaaawn*`
` With all that tension gone, I'm suddenly really tired..."`
`"Oh, yes, I promised to give back this key ring, didn't I—whoops?!"`
`"Ah, sorry!!"`
`When Coach plucked the magatama from his uniform pocket, his fingers slipped and flung it away! And... wh-why did it have to come flying toward me the exact moment my mouth was open wide?!`
`"Ngah?!"`
`"Nggnhh!!!"`
`"Aaahhhh?!"`
`"I-I-I swallowed it!!"`
`"Wh-What?!`
` What are you doing, Kei-chan?!`
` Throw it up, throw it up!!`
` This ol' man will punch you in the abdomen. Satoko, hold his arms behind his back!!`
` And... wham wham!!"`
`"G-Gwehh!!`
` P-Please stoooop!!"`
`"Oh, be quieeeeeeeeeeeet!!"`
`"Fghoh, gwehh!!`
` My body's going to regret this later!!"`
`"R... Rika-chama...`
` Does this mean we're too late?"`
`"...Meep!!`
` Once it goes into someone's stomach, it gets melted down and absorbed!`
` We've got a time limit of thirty minutes to do something!!"`
`"But we have the red and white magatama now!`
` If we take Keiichi and Rena to the Furude Shrine, I can undo the curse right away!"`
`"All right then, we're bringing the two of them to the shrine before they do something they can't take back!"`
`"Come on, Mion-san, Shion-san!`
` We're dragging them over there!!"`
`""Aye aye, sir!!!""`
