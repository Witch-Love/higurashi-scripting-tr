`...I heard the cries of higurashi in the distance.`
`In those cries dwelt such cool tenderness that I wanted to listen forever.`
`Eventually, the silence was broken.`
`The sound of many footsteps approached, pulling my mind back to reality.`
`Suddenly, the cries of the higurashi were gone.`
` ...The cries filling the room were that of cicadas.`
`...I thought I'd been hearing the higurashi this whole time... Was that a dream...?`
`I was in a bed.`
` ...I didn't recognize the ceiling.`
`Where was I?`
`The room was small, with an office desk and shelves full of medicine.`
`...I recognized the smell of that medicine.`
`And the voices of children mixing with the cicadas' cries.`
`I knew right away.`
` ...I was at school.`
` I was in bed at the nurse's office.`
`The door opened and Chie appeared.`
`Behind her was Satoko and,`
` ...huh?`
`My mind went blank.`
` ...It was the face of someone who couldn't have been there.`
`"Are you all right, Furude-san?`
` Ah, thank goodness!`
` I was really worried.`
` The doctor should be here soon.`
` Please, stay in bed until then."`
`"Thank goodness.`
` I really was worried."`
`My mind was still blank.`
` ...Dazed, I kept staring at his face as he spoke words of concern.`
`...This person could not possibly be at school in 1983.`
`".........Sa...`
` ...Satoshi..."`
`"...Are you okay...?`
` You still don't look very good."`
`"Stay in bed until the doctor gets here.`
`...That aside, Satoko Houjou-san!`
` Where are you hiding?!"`
`Chie raised her voice and turned back towards the hallway before Satoko poked her face out, looking as though she was sulking.`
`"...I didn't throw it that hard.`
` Furude-san is just exaggerating..."`
`"That isn't how you apologize!`
` Say sorry to Furude-san!"`
`I sensed something a little strange about Satoko's tone and mood.`
`...In any case, judging by the situation, Satoko had done something to me,`
` and as a result, I'd been carried to the nurse's office...`
` That's how it looked to me.`
`But... Didn't I pass out after falling off my bike on the way home from Okinomiya with everyone...?`
`"Come here, Satoko-san!"`
`Chie called Satoko in a firm voice.`
`...Chie called Satoko "Satoko-san" before Satoshi went missing.`
` The only time there were two people named Houjou was when Satoko and Satoshi were both here together.`
` In other words, before June, 1982.`
`Then...`
` Was this...`
` ...the past?`
`Was I repeating everything again...?`
`...I felt a chill start to crawl through me.`
`I'd gone through all that hardship to get past June of 1983, and now the world had rewound to the past again...`
`The dead end of June 1983 that I challenged for over a hundred years, and finally broke through...`
` Would I have to defeat it again?`
`I certainly learned many things and defeated my fate with certain willpower, but... I was also saved by a lot of luck.`
`There was no proof I could challenge June 1983 again and defeat it like I did last time.`
`......Which meant...`
` I was...`
` probably...`
` hit by that car in the bike accident...`
` and killed.`
`...And......`
` just before dying, I had rejected death and rewound the world.`
`The way that unrealistic memory cut off was definitely similar to when I'd rewound the world previously.`
`Then... would I...`
` have to undertake a terribly long journey again?`
`..................That...`
` ...that can't be...`
`The idea was infinitely terrifying.`
` ...As it dawned upon me, I felt as though my vision was growing distant.`
`...I still hadn't... fully understood just how terrifying this was just yet.`
`"Come, Satoko.`
` You need to apologize."`
`"...Furude-san, I'm sorry for throwing the ball at you!`
` But you were just standing there and being in the way!"`
`Satoko's apology was strange.`
` ...It wasn't even an apology, really; it literally sounded like an excuse.`
`She looked at Chie and Satoshi, wondering if that was enough.`
`It didn't seem like Satoko had any intention of apologizing for throwing the ball at me.`
`...Because Satoko wasn't even looking at me. Not really.`
`I wasn't... It was like I didn't belong in her world.`
`...She'd never treated me this coldly before.`
`And... before anything else, she's talking strangely.`
`It didn't seem like the situation that had befallen me was a rewind to so far in the past that Satoshi was still around...`
`Something else had happened, something bizarre that I didn't understand...`
`That's how I felt as I listened to the odd way Satoko was talking.`
` ...She sounded far more normal than the Satoko I knew.`
`Satoko made a face, like reading out a standard written apology was enough, then ran off into the hallway.`
`I checked the clock. It was right in the middle of afternoon break.`
`...She was probably rushing back to the schoolyard because she didn't want to miss any more playtime.`
`...As she turned her back on me and ran away, I suddenly felt very cold and sad.`
`If the Satoko I knew had hurt me enough to put me in the nurse's office, she would have stayed with me the entire time...`
`Her footsteps vanished before she'd even looked at me once.`
`It didn't seem like she hated me.`
` ...It felt like she wasn't even interested.`
`...What was happening?`
`What year and what month was it right now, anyway?`
` ...Hanyuu was nowhere to be found.`
`Despite wanting to know, no calendar or anything like one was nearby, so it didn't seem like I could find out right now.`
`Most normal people would give you a strange look if you asked what the year and month were, and I'd learned from my long journey that I had to be careful about that.`
`...Instead, I decided to push that question aside for the moment.`
`"Sorry, Rika-chan.`
` I'll make sure to talk to Satoko later.`
` I'm sure she asked you to play with her because you seemed lonely."`
`"...Meep.`
` Thanks.`
` I'm not worried about it anymore, so it's okay."`
`As Satoko's older brother, Satoshi, apologized in her stead...`
` ...He seemed no different from the Satoshi I knew.`
`"All right.`
` ...I'm going to get going, then."`
`"...Thank you, Satoshi."`
`"Any time."`
`Satoshi gave a little wave of his hand, turned, and left the nurse's office.`
`A new set of footsteps approached in his place.`
`From their pace and sound, it wasn't a child.`
` ...It was probably Coach; Chie had called for him.`
`"Ah, Doctor.`
` I'm sorry to call you out so suddenly.`
` She just woke up a few minutes ago."`
`"Is that right? That's good, that's good!"`
`It was a throaty voice.`
` ...It wasn't Irie...?`
`The man who suddenly appeared was one I'd never seen in the clinic, or even at the Irie Institute.`
`He was a large man with round curves, the exact opposite of Irie.`
`The stubble on his face made him seem rugged; he was so distinct that I wouldn't forget him even if I'd only met him once.`
` ...And yet I had no recollection of him.`
`But he was wearing a white robe.`
`And Chie had called him the doctor from the clinic.`
`...So he must have been a doctor from the Irie Clinic.`
` ......But I'd never met him before.`
`"Heya, Rika-chan!`
` You sure went through a lot!`
` Did the ball hit you in the back of the head?`
` Would you mind if I took a look?"`
`"...M-Meep..."`
`Without waiting for an answer, the mountaineerish doctor felt around the back of my head.`
`His fingers were uncultured, completely different from Irie's delicate hands.`
`"Could you show me your eyes?`
` ...Yep, you seem all right.`
` Do you have a headache or anything?`
` Any nausea or dizziness?"`
`"...No."`
`"Hmmm!`
` I think you're probably fine, then.`
` Just to be sure, we'll take you to the clinic and look at your brain waves.`
` Still, as far as I can see, there's no problem at all!"`
`"Gah-hah-hah-hah!"`
` The doctor laughed uproariously, spraying spittle everywhere.`
`Chie gave a look of relief, too, as if that was a sign there were no problems.`
`"I see.`
` Then, just to be safe, I'll leave her in your care.`
` Furude-san, please go with the doctor to the clinic."`
`"Indeed!`
` You'll be in and out before afternoon hours begin!`
` Let's go!"`
`The big doctor, acting too familiar for my tastes, pushed me out the door, and before I could fight my feeling of wrongness, I was taken out of the nurse's office.`
`...What was this world?`
`Sometimes the dice came up with strange numbers and caused little differences.`
`But this... This was the first world that felt this wrong to me.`
`Did the dice rolls turn up something rare?`
`After repeating this world for over a hundred years, I thought I'd figured out pretty much every event, and yet this all felt so strange to me.`
`......There was something immeasurable about how strange it was, and I couldn't help but feel intensely anxious...`
`I put my shoes on at the entrance before being taken to a parked car in front of the school gate.`
`All the while I stared at the big man's back as he walked, racking my brains trying to remember him, but I couldn't come up with anything.`
`...No matter how much I thought back, I couldn't recall any man like this in the Mountain Dogs, much less the Irie Institute.`
`...If Satoshi was here, that meant it had to be before June 1982.`
`Hanyuu would always be there as soon as I woke up.`
`And she'd tell me what was going on in that world.`
` ...But in this world, I haven't seen Hanyuu even once.`
`The radiant sunlight, the annoying cicada cries, the lively voices of my classmatesâ€”I knew them all so well......`
` But something was different.`
` It almost made me sick.`
`...Hanyuu, where am I...?`
`What kind of world is this...?`
`...............`
`Hanyuu didn't answer me.`
`...Fine, then.`
`If I went home and opened a bottle of wine, she'd be sure to come rushing in.`
`Not once had she ever allowed me a few elegant minutes to myself.`
`"Mii-chan, Mii-chan, take thiiiis!!"`
`"Hah!`
` Too slow!`
` The most important rule of dodgeball is to go for the weaklings!`
` Aiming for me was a tactical mistake!`
` And the next slowest one is you!!"`
`"Fugyaah!!`
` Owww..."`
`I saw several classmates playing a game of dodgeball.`
`Mion and Rena were there in the crowd.`
`...Rena?`
`Any world where Rena was present was later than April 1982.`
`And Satoshi disappeared from the village in June 1982.`
`The only time Rena and Satoshi could be here at the same time was the short span from April to June of 1982.`
`......It didn't seem like I'd gone as far into the past as I'd feared.`
`But I still had to repeat the June of 1983; that hadn't changed.`
`Did I have to complete those long, difficult days of nothing but strife yet again...?`
`Teaming up with my friends, trusting each other, grappling with our suspicions of each other, believing in miracles... and fighting alongside everyone.`
` And all the coincidences in the world to help save us.`
`If we missed any one of those elements of the process, this world would end in horrific tragedy.`
`...I'd gotten past this dead end before.`
`This was the second time, so I understood a little of how to fight against Takano's group.`
`...So I probably wouldn't have to spend another whole hundred years.`
`Even still, it would definitely take several of those years, if not dozens.`
`...But I never wanted to spend another day in that June of 1983 ever again...`
`The despair I felt at reaching the goal once, then getting kicked back to the start...`
`.........Sigh.`
`I got into the man's car, and as it bumped over the rough roads, I sorted out the situation I was in.`
`That day in July, 1983.`
`I went to have a good time at the pool with everyone, and on the way home, there was an accident... and I died.`
`And right before dying, I used the power I never thought I'd have to use again to turn back time once more.`
`This world was probably in June of 1982.`
`It was considerably hot, so the Watanagashi Festival couldn't be far off.`
`That meant the countdown to Satoshi's disappearance had already begun.`
`Earlier in the nurse's office, he'd given me kind and considerate words, but an unyielding darkness would have been starting to take control of his heart... his fear of his inescapable terminal illness's footsteps...`
`......I thought back to how the Houjou siblings had looked in the nurse's office.`
`And to Satoko and Satoshi's everyday sibling relationship.`
` ...It would cease to be an "everyday" thing in just another few days or weeks.`
`Satoko's somewhat cold treatment of me had hurt, but when I remembered that, I felt pity for her.`
`...Satoko.`
` For now, at least, treasure that time.`
`Your relationship with Satoshi is... limited.`
`That cruel fact hadn't been overruled a single time in any of these hundred years of worlds.`
`In other words...... it was inevitable.`
`I could only sympathize with the fate awaiting Satoko now...`
`Eventually the Irie Clinic came into view.`
`Every time I saw it, I was struck by its magnificence; it was almost too much for Hinamizawa.`
`But this time, the clinic building felt a little dull, as though affected by the sadness coloring my heart.`
`The car came to a stop in the employee parking lot near the back entrance.`
`"Can you walk?`
` Are you feeling well?"`
`"...Meep.`
` I'm perfectly fine.`
` I don't think I need a brain scan."`
`"Head injuries are scary because some take a while to do anything.`
` We'll play it safe and get you scanned.`
` If it's nothing, you can go back for afternoon class!"`
`...This was the first time I'd met this strange doctor, but he didn't seem unreliable.`
`Maybe the cloudiness in my expression made me look like I was worried my injury was serious, and that was why he tried to cheer me up.`
`...His attempt at encouragement was off-base; but for now, I told myself that he wasn't a bad person, at least.`
`The air inside the clinic... smelled unfamiliar to me.`
`Inside, it was the same clinic as the one I knew...`
` but something was different.`
`On the whole, it felt old... like I'd find cobwebs if I looked.`
`And I recognized none of the nurses we passed.`
`...The only people I knew were some elderly villagers chatting as they watched TV in the waiting room.`
`"...Oh, hmm, is that you, Rika-chan?`
` What happened?`
` Do you have a cold?"`
`"Someone during recess threw a ball and it hit the back of her head.`
` Figured we should do a scan to make sure!"`
`"Mmm, head injuries can be scary!`
` But you're young, so I'm sure one or two balls to the head is nothing!"`
`The old people laughed aloud, as though rubbing some spit on the bump would fix it.`
`...Something about their behavior was strange, too.`
`The people I knew would get out their beads, start praying, and make a big fuss just because I got a bump on the head...`
`Maybe they'd say one or two balls is fine because you're young... if I were a normal child.`
` But for me in particular, in Hinamizawa, that was impossible.`
`...This all seemed very wrong.`
` ......Something huge, something I couldn't ignore, was different about this world.`
`"Rika-chan!`
` Come in, come in!"`
`After the large man went straight into the examination room, he called me in.`
`...The queen carrier had come for an examination, and the next logical step was that Irie, the director, would appear... but he hadn't appeared yet. `
`...The discomfort I'd been feeling this whole time got even stronger.`
`And then... I spotted something odd.`
`It was a notice from the hospital, hung in the waiting room.`
`"Please be sure to bring your insurance card on your first checkup of the month.`
` Takano Clinic"`
`......Huh?`
`Takano... Clinic...?`
`I looked around at the other notices hung about the waiting room.`
`...All of them had "Takano Clinic" written at the end.`
` Not a single one said "Irie Clinic."`
`..................Where......... am I......?`
`"Rika-chaaan, come on in!!`
` We're burning daylight!"`
`I heard the man's deep voice from the examination room again.`
`I ignored him and burst out the front entrance.`
` ...Why?`
` Because I wanted to know.`
`To know the name of this clinic.`
`..................Takano...`
` Clinic.`
`It looked exactly like the Irie Clinic I knew...`
` but there it wasâ€”the answer to why everything felt so out of place.`
`"......Where.........`
` is this......?"`
`I could feel the strength drain from my body.`
`My legs gave out, and I sat... For a while, I stared dumbly up at the name that was inexplicably different...`
`...I'm not sure how long I stayed like that.`
`Eventually, the big doctor from before and a nurse came running out.`
`They asked me if I suddenly felt sick, and if I didn't answer, they would annoyingly get even more concerned.`
`...So, somewhat off-handedly, I lied that I felt a little dizzy for a moment.`
`But they must have thought the vertigo pointed to a symptom of something.`
`They picked me up and brought me into the examination room, hooked me up to an EEG terminal, and told me to rest.`
`"...Meep.`
` It's really nothing.`
` I thought this would be annoying, so I tried to run away, then I tripped and fell."`
`"It's the doctor's job to decide if it's nothing.`
` Please lay down until I say it's okay.`
` Understand?"`
`"........."`
`I felt like the more I tried to say, the more complicated things would get, so for now, I decided to play along so I could get out of there...`
`"...Doctor.`
` Is there a doctor named Irie here?"`
`"What?`
` Who did you say?"`
`"Irie."`
`"...Irie?`
` Is that your family doctor, Rika-chan?`
` What hospital does he work at?"`
`"........."`
`We're getting nowhere...`
`Is Irie not in this world...?`
`Compared to everything the other adults like Akasaka and Kasai did during the long battle of June 19, Irie's presence might have seemed to matter little... but it was extremely important that he was around.`
`Without his determination to sever the chain of sadness created by Hinamizawa Syndrome, there was essentially no way for Hinamizawa to break free of its thousand-year curse.`
`...And Irie... wasn't here.`
`...Plus, Irie was my only ally who knew I was the queen carrier.`
` ......That ally was gone.`
`The strange way Satoko was talking.`
`The absence of my only ally from "Tokyo," Irie...`
`No doubt some unpleasant die had landed on a 1.`
`...Then despite my ally Irie not being here, was Takano still behind everything?`
` ......When you get one bad roll, you get a bunch more.`
`"Dr. Takano passed away quite a while ago.`
` The name comes from that splendid doctor who built such a wonderful clinic in this village. `
`Someone I never had the chance to meet, but a splendid doctor if there ever was one, I hear."`
`"...`
` A...`
` splendid doctor?"`
`Would the occult-obsessed Takano ever be praised as a 'splendid doctor'?`
` ...And she passed away a while ago...?`
`When I looked around the examination room, I found a picture of some old people hanging in a frame.`
`On it was written "Founder and First Director, Hifumi Takano".`
`...Hifumi... Takano?`
`Wasn't that the man Takano looked up to, who she called her grandfather?`
`He was the first one to discover the Hinamizawa Syndrome, but nobody accepted his theories about it, and he passed away in despair. `
`...Takano had understood his chagrin and eventually made a big decision, then began to build a future so stable you could call it fate...`
`...That Takano...?`
`"Another person named Takano?`
` Not the founder?`
` Hmm, I can't say I know them.`
` None of the nurses are named that, anyway.`
` ...Maybe it was an old nurse who retired before I got here?"`
`"...I don't think so.`
` She's a young woman."`
`"Hmm.`
` There's nobody here by that name.`
` If there was a nurse like that, I'd definitely want her to work here! Wah-hah-hah-ha!"`
`The man guffawed with delight; he certainly didn't look like he was lying.`
` He was speaking the truth.`
`...Then even Takano...`
` is gone...?`
`Irie was absent, Takano was absent.`
`The Irie Institute didn't have its director or vice director.`
`...What did that all mean?`
`Who was the director, then?`
`Oh, and what about the Mountain Dogs?`
`The Irie Institute was, at its heart, a research institution.`
`Without them acting as its hands and feet, it couldn't exist.`
`"...Is there a landscaping company here called Okonogi Gardeners?"`
`"Huh?`
` Landscapers?`
` Couldn't tell ya!`
` Never had to call one of them, myself.`
` Wouldn't really know.`
` Where are they from?"`
`"...Umm... I thought they had an office in Okinomiya."`
`"Hmm.`
` Why not look them up in a phone book later?`
` Individual people sometimes don't show up in them, but I think most companies should be in there."`
`Could... Could the Irie Institute not exist in this world...?`
`Would that mean... this world didn't have a dead end...`
` at all...?`
`...I couldn't figure anything out.`
`Which dice were showing one, and which were showing six?`
`...Or was the stranger part the dots on the dice themselves?`
`The game board I was a piece on now, and the game board I knew... were they different?`
`Let's be a little more optimistic.`
`...Was it possible that... Tokyo hadn't chosen Irie, but this man instead?`
`Then would this man know I was the queen carrier...?`
`If he did, then a number of things would fall into place.`
`The prudence of giving me a brain scan after just getting knocked over by a ball to the head...`
` Wasn't that because he knew I was special, that I was the queen carrier?`
`...Then was this man playing the role of Irie in this world...?`
`I looked at the nametag on the robe he put on after coming into the room and read the name.`
`"...Yamamoto."`
`"Yes?"`
`It was a natural response... It seemed the name Yamamoto wasn't a problem.`
`Was this Yamamoto person the director of the Irie Institute... or, rather, the Yamamoto Institute?`
`It was also possible that he'd crowned this clinic with the Takano name in commemoration of him succeeding Hifumi Takano's research...`
`"...Yamamoto, do you know what the Hinamizawa Syndrome is?"`
`"The Hinamizawa what?"`
`"...Do you know about me being the queen carrier, or anything...?"`
`"Queen?`
` Wah-hah-hah-ha!`
` Rika-chan, you seem to me like you're still a princess!`
` Do you want to be a queen when you grow up?`
` Hahaha. You dream big.`
` Okay, there we go.`
` You can take it off now."`
`I learned from just that short exchange that Yamamoto had nothing to do with the Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`...There were a few people unconnected to Tokyo in the Irie Institute, too.`
`But they were only a small handful of nurses and office workers.`
`And besides, the queen carrier was currently in the clinic.`
`Anyone connected to the Hinamizawa Syndrome would have come rushing to me.`
`Yamamoto had rushed to me, but he didn't know I was the queen carrier... What did that mean?`
`I listened hard to try and catch the sound of Irie's indiscreet laughter, but all I heard was the TV in the waiting room and the motor of the goldfish aquarium.`
`That maid-obsessed man with his ulterior motives during checkups was nowhere to be seen in the examination room.`
`It was simply uncomfortable, and the smells of dust and medicine made me feel unpleasant.`
`Now I knew.`
`This really wasn't the clinic I knew.`
`It wasn't just a strange feeling anymoreâ€”it was a clear fact now.`
`Yamamoto left for a moment, then came back and told me there was nothing wrong with my readings.`
`"If you feel all right, you can go back to school now.`
` Afternoon class will start soon, so I can take you there if you need a ride.`
` Can you go to school yourself?"`
`"...Meep."`
`"'Meep' isn't a yes or no.`
` Which'll it be?"`
`"...Y...Yes.`
` I'm fine. I can go back to school myself."`
`"I see.`
` Then get going.`
` I'll call Chie-sensei and tell her you're coming back."`
`"..................Oh..."`
`When I saw Yamamoto pick up the phone on the table...`
` I spotted a tabletop calendar next to it.`
`June, Showa 58.`
`...Showa 58... What was that in A.D. again...`
`The Pacific War ended in Showa 20, which was 1945.........`
` 58 minus 20......`
` I'm bad at borrowing, but luckily I don't need it...`
`...Hm...`
` hm...`
` hm...`
` 58-20=38?`
`Yes, 38 plus 20 is definitely 58.`
`...Then, if you add 38 to 1945...`
` ...45+38...`
` ...is 83?`
`It's... 1983?`
` June?`
`Wasn't that the same period of time I had just been living in?`
`But... Huh?`
` That's impossible.`
`......In 1983...`
` Satoshi is here?`
`And Irie isn't here, Takano isn't here, Satoko is acting strangely, and even Hanyuu is gone...`
`...Where...... Where am I?`
`Hanyuu, I know you're wasting time somewhere... Get over here with your "au au"s and tell me what kind of world this is...`
`I walked through downtown on my way back to school.`
`All the storefronts were familiar; nothing had changed.`
`But for some reason, there were less people, and more stores with their shutters closed.`
`...This apparent state of decline reminded me of New Year's or New Year's Eve.`
` ...It was a strange sight during the season when you could hear cicadas crying.`
`I barely passed anyone, and even when old people walked by, they didn't talk to me.`
`...Normally if I met an old person in the middle of the day like this, they'd ask if I had a cold and was staying home from school, or they'd start rubbing their prayer beads and saying weird things. `
`...There was none of that.`
` Just like the old people in the clinic, they reacted with disinterest.`
`I wasn't in the mood for it anyway, so I was thankful they didn't do any of that...`
` But there was already a heap of oddities before me, and I couldn't help but feel like it was growing even bigger.`
`Afternoon break was long over by the time I got back to school, and it was now time for afternoon classes.`
`I went through the entrance and changed into my slippers.`
`...And then I noticed another strange thing.`
` ...There were a lot of empty shoe cubbies.`
`Empty was different from absent.`
`Anyone enrolled would leave either slippers or regular footwear in their locker, no matter what.`
`...If neither were present, that meant they weren't in this class to begin with.`
`Sometimes people took their slippers home to wash during the weekends... but any lockers being empty during the day was unthinkable.`
`I counted... a little over ten pairs of shoes.`
`That was only half of how many people were in the school I knew.`
`...Everything was so messed up... I had no idea what was going on.`
`I steeled myself and opened the classroom door.`
`Everyone turned around to look at me.`
`There truly were only half of the familiar classmates there.`
` And they weren't absent.`
`...Because only half as many seats were actually in the classroom.`
`"Furude-san, please take your seat.`
` All right, everyone!`
` This is class time, so focus on your drills!"`
`Chie clapped her hands, and everyone looked back down at their desks and workbooks, ignoring me altogether.`
`...My seat.`
`Satoshi was sitting at the desk next to Satoko's.`
` ......That didn't seem to be my seat.`
`Then where was it?`
`...Soon, I found an open seat, looking small and quiet in the back near the window.`
`I could tell from the pattern of the floor cushion with my disaster hood in it.`
` That seemed to be Rika Furude's seat in this world.`
`It was in the corner, as though the classroom had forgotten about it.`
`There were no seats next to it, and nobody would see it when looking at the blackboard.`
`In a place where I wouldn't block anyone's view, whether or not I wasn't here.`
`That seat was almost symbolic of how I'd been feeling ever since I awoke.`
`I sat down and took out my workbook. Then, pretending to study, I looked around the classroom.`
`...Mion Sonozaki was here.`
`She didn't seem very different.`
`Rena Ryuugu was here, too.`
`The way she was helping the child in the next seat over with his work was very like her.`
`Satoko and Satoshi... were studying together as friendly siblings.`
`Satoshi, being the older brother, was teaching her things, but Satoko looked disgruntled, and his words went in one ear and out the other.`
`To me, it was almost like she didn't hate studyingâ€”she just didn't like their roles being reversed, since she looked after him at home, and it made me smile a little.`
`I still felt a tiny pain in my chest from Satoko's cold treatment of me in the nurse's office, but as far as I could tell by looking at her individually, she seemed totally normal.`
`But... I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong there.`
`When Satoko was with Satoshi, she was often gloomy because of problems at home or their aunt's abuse, so...`
` They were acting like normal siblings... and, though I knew it was rude to Satoko, that felt wrong.`
`But if Satoko had a normal life, that was fine.`
`The bigger shock, though...`
` was the absence of the most important person in our group of friends.`
`............I looked around the room several times for him...`
` but he wasn't here.`
`Keiichi Maebara... wasn't here.`
`I made multiple excuses, like I wasn't seeing right, or he happened to be absent today.`
`But even the list of students on cleaning duty hanging on the wall didn't have Keiichi's name on it.`
`...Everyone in the class would have had their names on there, but Keiichi's...`
` wasn't.`
`Keiichi Maebara did not exist in this classroom.`
` ...Even though it was June of 1983 in this world.`
`............I see.`
` ...On rare occasions, there would be a world where Keiichi hadn't moved here.`
`It wasn't the first time, but... it was a sad thing.`
`Keiichi was an important key to crushing the fate of June 1983.`
`...If he wasn't on the game board, then this game was predetermined to be a loss.`
`...But was this even a game at all?`
`No Irie, no Takano.`
` No signs of the institute from Tokyo researching Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`If none of them were here...`
` didn't that mean there was nobody at all to fight?`
`If I didn't need to fight...`
` then...`
` in a sense, Keiichi's absence wasn't an issue.`
`...Actually, in this case, June 1983 wasn't fated to be a dead end, and...`
` umm...`
`In other words, in this world, the thousand dice all turned up ones, and that changed that absolute fate Takano had constructed with her certain willpower... into something else...?`
`.........I had no idea what was what.`
`Could this world even be explained by what dots came up on the dice?`
`Where... where am I...`
`...Someone, tell me...`
`Obviously unable to focus during class... my head was filled with the listless cries of the cicadas and the feeling of being out of place that I couldn't get rid of...`
`"Everybody stand up!`
` Bow!!"`
`"""Good-bye!!"""`
`Thankfully, Mion was still class president.`
` ...For some reason, that was a relief.`
`...Oh.`
` ...Was there even a club in this world?`
`If I could receive the baptism of those crazy club games... maybe it would clear up my feelings a little.`
`...On days we had club, she'd always call all the members right when school ended.`
`Expecting that, I stayed in my seat as everyone ran out into the hallway.`
`Satoko was one of those who dashed out.`
`She was flying headlong towards the entrance, jostling the other kids her age.`
`Satoshi left too, following behind her.`
`Mion and Rena talked to each other as they got ready to leave.`
`As far as it looked, we didn't have club.`
`...The club was annoying at times, but I yearned for it so much now... Was there no club in this world?`
`As I started to feel lonely, I saw a grin spread across Mion's face before she and Rena approached me.`
`Normally that grin would look gross, but when Mion did it, it didn't feel bad.`
`Our eyes met.`
` ...Thank goodness.`
` Even this world had the after-school club it was supposed to.`
`"Hey, hey, Rika-chama~!`
` Got a moment before you go home~?"`
`"...Meep! Is it club?"`
`For the first time since coming to this world, I smiled.`
`I had no idea what was going on in this world, so having one of my hopes come true made me very happy, for the moment...`
`"No, not that. You're on duty tomorrow, right?`
` Here's the logbook.`
` And club, huh? Hah-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` What, did you want to be in my club too, Rika-chan?"`
`"...Meep!"`
`I gleaned two things from Mion's few words.`
`One was that I still wasn't a club member.`
`The other was that, even so, the club still existed.`
` ...For me, right now, that was an incredibly happy thought.`
`"Hmm!`
` Then, Rika Furude, I hereby grant you permission to join my club!"`
`"Mii-chan, you're being weird.`
` Ahh hahahahahahaha."`
`Rena laughed like it was a funny joke... But why...?`
`"But even if you're in the same club, you still can't do club things with us."`
`"...Wh... Why not?"`
`"I mean.`
` Your house and my house are in opposite directions, right?"`
`"...Meep...?"`
`Umm...... Oh...`
`When Mion said "her club," she probably meant the "club" of not having a clubâ€”the "going home" club.`
`And she must have been saying we went home in different directions, which was why I couldn't do club activitiesâ€”going home togetherâ€”with her.`
`.........In other words... the club doesn't exist in this world, either.`
`"...Mii-chan.`
` Can't we have club activities with Rika-chan once in a while?"`
`"Hmm?`
` But we go in opposite directions."`
`"Aha ha. Maybe it's okay from time to time. Maybe."`
`After I realized I'd have to go home all alone, Rena said she'd leave school with me.`
`That kind consideration was just like the Rena I knew so well.`
`...We didn't have club, but Mion and Rena were still Mion and Rena...`
`"Sorry, but I'll have to pass.`
` I gotta get back quick for my job at my uncle's place."`
`"Oh.`
` Then Rika-chan and I will have our afterschool going-home club."`
`"......Thank you, Rena."`
`"Mm-hmm."`
`The three of us headed for the entrance.`
`Our outdoor shoes were the only ones left.`
`"...There are fewer slippers here than I remember."`
`Yes, I decided to naturally mention it.`
`Rena responded right away.`
`"It's lonely, but what can we do?"`
`"As they say, you gotta look for a nice big tree when you seek shelter.`
` Anyway, sorry about this, but I'm gonna get going.`
`I'll leave Rika-chan's escort to you, Reina!"`
`"Okay!"`
`"......Rei...`
` na...?"`
`"Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"......Nothing."`
`Rena was the kind Rena I knew... but her name wasn't Rena.`
`Reina.`
` ...That was Rena's real name, but in the worlds I knew, she'd thrown it aside.`
`...Which meant......... she hadn't given up being Reina...?`
`Or... her path leading to today was different from the one in the worlds I knew...?`
`I knew Rena hated herself because she considered herself responsible for her mother's divorce.`
`...And as she'd messed up both her life and herself...`
` She would have decided to part ways with that old self, start over, and rename herself 'Rena'.`
`But that... didn't happen...?`
`That wasn't the only thing I learned from this conversation, either.`
` Regarding the number of people in the class...`
`When I mentioned there weren't many people, they acted like there was a reason.`
`...That meant the current number of students in this world hadn't been that way from the start.`
` It had decreased to this number.`
`Mion ran off, and Rena and I left school together.`
`When we went across the schoolyard, I saw Satoko, fooling around playing tag.`
`"Are you looking at Satoko-chan?"`
`"......Meep."`
`Her name was different, but she still picked up on these things quickly.`
`"I'm sure Satoko-chan wasn't trying to be mean when she hit you with the ball.`
` Forgive her, okay?"`
`"......I don't really mind."`
`Rena... no, Reina seemed to be trying to smooth it over.`
`It kind of sounded like Satoko and I weren't normally friendly with one another.`
` So I asked.`
`"......Are Satoko and I... not friends?"`
`"Of course you are.`
` You're both in the same class."`
`"............"`
`The way she said that was enough of an answer.`
`...Now I knew why Satoko acted so coldly to me in the nurse's office.`
`In this world... Satoko and I weren't friends...`
`Maybe... that made sense.`
`After all, if Satoshi was alive and well, then Satoko would spend all her time with him.`
`The reason Satoko and I got to the point we could call close... was because Satoko ended up all alone, I asked her to stay at my house, and we started living together.`
`...Of course, we were friends before that too, just nowhere near how close we were in 1983.`
`Maybe, in the end, our relationship... was nothing more than me sitting in Satoshi's empty seat.`
`When I thought about that... when I considered what would happen if Satoshi was around in June, 1983... maybe this was the most natural future...`
`With regretful eyes, I watched as Satoko frolicked about.`
`Satoko looked like she was having a lot of fun with her other classmates. She wouldn't ever notice me going home from school.`
`......I'm going to stop thinking about it so much.`
`Before the true world I need to reach, this world is all but a defective one.`
`I don't need to bother trying to understand a broken world.`
`"......There's a lot less stores open, too."`
`When we went through downtown, with all its stores with their shutters down, Reina spoke up.`
`I didn't care about this world anymore, but as a classmate going home with her, I answered unconsciously.`
`"......I wonder why so many closed up."`
`"Well, it only makes sense.`
` They can only do business until next year anyway.`
` They're getting less and less customers, too.`
` It's not strange that some would want to close up shop early."`
`"......Why won't they do business after next year?"`
`"They can't. They're getting evicted."`
`"Evicted?"`
`"...It sucks, but there's nothing we can do.`
` ...And even if the village sinks, it won't destroy our souls, the ones that belong here."`
`I gave a start when I heard that.`
`That couldn't...... No... It was possible.`
`In every single world, the story of Hinamizawa being submerged under an artificial lake was always present.`
`But the Irie Institute, working from the shadows, would make sure that the dam project was cancelled.`
`If there was no Irie Institute around to make them cancel it, that meant the dam project was proceeding as planned, and...`
`"......Th-Then... The dam will...?"`
`"I heard they decided to flood this area next year.`
` ...I think it'll take quite a few days to submerge, but I don't really want to watch.`
` Maybe after it's all a lake, but... Watching it go under would be sad..."`
`"Wasn't anyone opposed to it...?"`
`"At first there were.`
` But we can't be selfish when it comes to helping the nation grow.`
` ...I don't really understand, but apparently the government people were really nice and talked to us a lot about it."`
`The dam conflict I was hearing from Reina... wasn't even a conflict in this world.`
` ...Everything regarding the dam was completely different from the worlds I knew.`
`They'd proposed the Hinamizawa Dam Project, which was the same as the worlds I knew.`
`Relations between the nation, who wanted to evict us, and the residents, who refused, gradually worsened... and eventually broke down.`
` It snowballed into a dire conflict over the dam.`
`...But in this world, it had been different from the very beginning.`
`First off, relations between the country and the village were stormy at the very, very beginning, but apparently that was resolved quickly.`
`The Sonozaki and Kimiyoshi families negotiated on the village's behalf, and they accepted the eviction on the promise of a large sum of compensation money.`
`After that, the conversation was between the Three Families and the villagers.`
`Nobody wanted to part with the soil of their ancestors.`
`But for the villagers, who certainly couldn't be called wealthy, the money the nation would provide was no trivial matter.`
`...They worried over it to no end.`
` Rumors flew about, wondering if Oyashiro-sama's curse would befall them if they abandoned these lands.`
`But the Furude family head...`
` my father, in other words, declared we couldn't be cursed if we built Oyashiro-sama a new shrine somewhere else and remembered to honor him.`
`Despite many objections, the elderly agreed on a cooling-off period of several years.`
`In addition to the compensation money, they demanded from the government the movement of the Furude Shrine, the graveyard, and its symbolic trees, in addition to the guarantee of a new place they could call Hinamizawa. `
`And if those requests were fulfilled, they would consider agreeing to the eviction.`
`The nation consented to this.`
`They proposed preferential occupation rights of reclaimed public housing land in Shishibone.`
`With regards to giving the town a new name, they considered the residents' proposal as most important, and they consented to the movement of the shrine, graveyard, and other locations as well.`
`...In conclusion, though there were several years of turmoil...`
` the dam conflict never happened in this world; everything was resolved through talking alone... `
`and the villagers had actually agreed to the dam project.`
`Actual construction on the dam had begun a few years ago, and apparently construction vehicles were a constant source of traffic on the village's wider roads.`
`And the eviction deadline was set at the end of April next year, so more than a few families had begun moving out in advance.`
`One closed shop's shutter had a worn paper notice on it.`
`On it was written... "Our deepest gratitude for your many years of patronage."`
`I spotted a few other notices with "Opposed to the dam" on them...`
` but those had deteriorated over time, a silent indication that the dam war was a thing of the past now...`
`"I don't think all of the kids in class are moving into the public housing.`
` Satoko-chan's family is supposedly moving somewhere else. `
`...It's a little lonely to think we won't be able to see all our friends after next year."`
`"......Meep."`
`The village I was born and grew up in being submerged was very sad...`
`But all my classmates, enjoying this day to the fullest even though they knew that, seemed so strong to me.`
`...And if the dam war never took place, that would cause several other effects.`
`For example... the relationship between the Sonozaki and the Houjou families.`
`At the beginning of the dam conflict, the Houjous declared themselves in favor of the dam, with the Sonozakis in opposition, and the former ended up a scapegoat of the village for a long time.`
`...But that trouble never occurred in this world...`
`"Satoko-chan's family?`
` I don't know. I think they're normal.`
` I don't think they have much particularly in common with Mii-chan's family."`
`"...Does Satoko... get along with her family?"`
`"Oh... you mean her father?"`
`Even without the dam conflict, the presence of a stepfather would be a burden on Satoko's mind.`
`And with the L5 symptoms appearing... she would push him from the viewing platform at the park... and be given into the care of her malicious aunt and uncle...`
`Because her stepfather's presence would be the very gateway to Satoko's later, unfortunate fate...`
`"When I think about it now, maybe their awkwardness with each other at first made for a good memory.`
` ...They aren't connected by blood... `
`So they tried hard to be father and daughter... and maybe now they have a stronger bond than she would with her biological parents. `
`......I've talked to them a bunch of times, but he's a good person that works hard to support his family."`
`"...You mean Satoko's current father?"`
`"Yep."`
`Which meant... In this world, none of the dice threatening Satoko had come up on a one.`
`For Satoko... did that make this world a happy place for her...?`
`.........`
`My walk home with Reina was very significant for me understanding this world.`
`And I found out that this world's composition betrayed every last bit of my common sense...`
`The reason Reina wasn't Rena.`
` ...That was different from the very start.`
`First, the Ryuugu family didn't move to Ibaraki.`
`They had lived in Hinamizawa this entire time.`
`Her mother was still working as a designer at a small company in the city.`
`Her father had switched careers, and now he was a salesman for his wife's designs.`
`...The couple must have been on good terms for one to design things and the other to sell them.`
`As always, her mother's position seemed to be stronger, but their relationship was an average one... and divorce, at the very least, seemed impossible.`
`That meant a nice, peaceful family for Reina.`
`...That satisfied her fully, and she even said that she lived a happy life.`
`......The fact that she knew that without going through hardships, thoughâ€”she really was still Rena.`
`I asked about the Takano Clinic, too.`
`It was as the big doctor Yamamoto had said.`
`The Takano of Takano Clinic was indeed the one who had been Miyo Takano's adopted grandfather.`
`Hifumi Takano.`
`Right after the war, he built a surprisingly grand clinic in Hinamizawa, which had no doctors, and became a celebrity to the villagers.`
`I learned that there was a monument dedicated to Takano in the place of the one dedicated to Irie in the worlds I knew.`
`After Takano's passing, there was nobody to succeed his place in the clinic, and for a long time, it had been left empty.`
`That was when a man from Okinomiya named Yamamoto arrived and breathed new life into the clinic.`
`...Takano had discovered the Hinamizawa Syndrome and searched for research sponsors, but found none.`
`And eventually, Miyo Takano would succeed him... but what if the older Takano had found a sponsor?`
`Neither Miyo Takano nor Irie would appear, and the Takano Clinic being built right after the war would make sense.`
`...Which meant that Takano, in this world, had been blessed with good dice rolls.`
`At this point, I had a vague idea about something.`
`...Weren't these dice rolls the exact opposite of the ones for the world I knew well?`
`The people themselves hadn't changed at all.`
` But the dice God had cast for these people were all reversed.`
`...So it made sense that it had turned into such a strange world for me.`
`I learned one more thing from talking to Reina, too.`
`...In this world, I had no friends. I was all alone.`
`Keiichi never transferred to our school, we didn't have a club, and Satoko had no connection to me...`
` so maybe it was only natural.`
`At that point, I finally realized why Reina had sympathized with me going home alone and done her "going-home club activities" with me.`
`"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow."`
`"...Huh?`
` ............Oh... I see."`
`For a moment, I was confused when she said good-bye, since we weren't in front of the temple... but I quickly understood.`
`We were in front of the Furude main house.`
`Since Takano never appeared, there was no Irie Institute, nor any research into Hinamizawa Syndrome...... and so, my parents never died.`
`...At first, my parents cooperated with the researchers...`
` but when I fell ill with a high fever one day, they stopped cooperating... had some kind of trouble, and were assassinated.`
`My mother was the hysterical type; when she made a fuss, settling her down took a while.`
`And because she made a fuss, the Irie Institute, which wanted to do its research in secret, naturally wanted to make sure she didn't talk.`
`She'd held such an attitude even knowing how shady the Institute was...`
` so in a sense, I couldn't deny that she reaped what she sowed.`
`In any case, no matter how many times I did this over, no matter how many times I warned her, it never worked, and I had resigned myself to the fact that I'd no longer have parents by 1981.`
`...And I'd repeated it many times.`
`I'd seen my parents for dozens of years in total, so I was fed up with them.`
` ...We weren't on good terms to begin with anyway.`
`And now, in June of 1983, they were here again...`
`"I'll see you again tomorrow.`
` Bye-bye~!"`
`"......Good-bye.`
` Nipah~ â˜†"`
`After seeing Reina off, I looked at my real home.`
`...I saw my mother patting out a dried futon in the yard.`
`In normal worlds, they would always die... but in this one, they were alive the whole time.`
`...I found myself unsure of how to talk to my real mother...`
`"Is that you, Rika?`
` Welcome home."`
`"...Meep.`
` I'm home."`
`"Go wash your hands and rinse out your mouth.`
` And then get your books ready for tomorrow.`
` Did you get any homework?"`
`............`
` Yes, she was my mother, all right.`
`Honestly speaking... I wasn't used to the Furude main house.`
`It was my true home... but it had only ever been my home before 1983...`
` like a prison of time while I waited in melancholy for the day Keiichi transferred here.`
`But Keiichi wouldn't transfer here, and my parents wouldn't die.`
`Which meant in this world, I would never get out of this prison...`
`...But maybe that was a weird way to think about it.`
` ...Without a dead-end fate, there was no victory or defeat, no destiny or miracles.`
`This was my actual home.`
` ......It was nothing more, and nothing less.`
`I went to my room, put down my bookbag, and took a breath.`
`...Usually, when I was by myself, Hanyuu would appear.`
`But in this world, she hadn't shown up.`
`How long are you planning on wasting time?`
`...Hurry up and appear, and take me back to my original world.`
`I knew by now this world was odd and filled with what-ifs.`
` I'd had it up to here with my exploration of this alternate universe.`
`But Hanyuu didn't appear...`
`...Oh, that's right.`
` Hanyuu was by herself in the ritual storehouse a lot.`
` Maybe she was there right now.`
`In any case, whatever else happened, I just wanted to see Hanyuu.`
`I put on my shoes and ran out towards the shrine...`
`As I turned my back on my annoying mother who called after me, asking if I'd really rinsed out my mouth.`
`In a world where my father was alive, it was hard to get the key to the storehouse.`
`But thanks to the innumerable worlds I'd been through, I found a way to get into the storehouse without it.`
`I could hear the elders having a pleasant talk in the assembly hall, my father's laughs mixed in with theirs.`
`...My father hated me even going near the ritual storehouse.`
`...Well, considering what it stored, I could sort of understand why he wouldn't want to let his beloved daughter inside it.`
`After making sure nobody was looking, I climbed up a tree growing behind the storehouse.`
`...My climb didn't go as smoothly as when Satoko had shown me she could do it.`
`In any case, I crawled up stubbornly and jumped down onto the storehouse roof.`
`I was a little scared of jumping.`
` I'd climbed pretty high off the ground.`
`...Even a centenarian witch can't escape the danger of heights.`
`If I recalled right, there was a broken lattice window on the roof, and you could get in and out through there.`
`......This world was betraying all my expectations, and giving me the exact opposite.`
`I considered that maybe you couldn't go in and out through it anymore.`
`But... in the place Satoko once told me about, it was broken just like she said, and a child would be able to fit inside.`
`...Even trivial things like this were a relief.`
`Maybe just the sun setting in the west would be a relief for me right now.`
`...Because in this world, it could always set in the east.`
`Yes, this discomfort I felt at having to doubt everything... made me feel dizzy and sick.`
`"...Hanyuu?`
` .........Hanyuu?`
` ......Are you there?"`
`......No answer.`
`I was too afraid to call out again.`
`Because maybe if I did, I still wouldn't get any answer.`
` ......For me, personally, Hanyuu not existing in this world was the one dice roll that couldn't happen.`
`".....................Hanyuu?`
` ...Hanyuu?!"`
`Then I felt something I couldn't describe.`
`The presence of someone, but not a person.`
`...Something only I could perceiveâ€”the presence of Hanyuu.`
`But Hanyuu always answered me when I called for her.`
` She wasn't nowâ€”what did that mean?`
`But she was here.`
` She was!`
`I couldn't help poking my head through the roof.`
`I climbed down a bundle of hanging chains and entered.`
`"...Hanyuu, Hanyuu!`
` Where are you?`
` Answer me...!!"`
`.........Rika...`
` .........Rika......`
` Where are you...`
`This time, I heard her for sure.`
` There was no doubt!`
`"Hanyuu!`
` I'm right here!`
` Where are you?!`
` I can't see you at all...!"`
`...Rika......`
` Rika...`
` Answer me......`
`Hanyuu's feeble words implied she was actually the one who couldn't hear my voice.`
`I looked for a place where I could hear her better.`
`Before I realized it, I went to the altar in front of the holy vessel.`
`Something that looked like a small crystal ball was on the altar, and I sensed it giving off a faint light.`
`......That was where Hanyuu's voice seemed to be coming from.`
`The ball was about the size of a large toy marble.`
`But it was seated respectfully on a small cushion, which told me it was no ordinary stone.`
`I took the crystal ball in my hand and pressed it to my ear.`
`"...Rika, if you can hear me, please answer again...`
` Rika... Rika..."`
`There was no doubt.`
` I was hearing Hanyuu's voice from this crystal ball.`
`And it sounded like it was searching for me, growing more distant all the while...`
`"Hanyuu!`
` I can hear you! It's me, Rika!!`
` I'm right here...!!"`
`"...Rika...... Rika...`
` I can hear your voice.`
` ...Where are you? I can't find you.`
` Your voice is so distant, I don't understand...`
` Please, call louder..."`
`"I'm here!!`
` I'm right here!!`
` Why can I hear your voice from this crystal ball?`
` Wait, no, that's not important!`
` I'm right here, right in front of the altar in the storehouse!!`
` Hanyuu, Hanyuu!!"`
`"...I can hear your voice...`
` I'm searching for you now.`
` Please don't let go of the Fragment...`
` Keep on calling my name... louder..."`
`"I'm here!!`
` Hanyuu!!`
` Come, hurry!!`
` Hanyuu, Hanyuu!!"`
`For a while, I kept shouting her name as if I'd gone mad.`
`It was like clinging to a tin can telephone right before the string snapped.`
`...If Hanyuu's voice cut off in the middle, if she left me behind, alone, in the darkness of the storehouse...`
` That was scarier than anything else I could imagine.`
`So, as she told me to, I shouted her name over and over again.`
`Hanyuu had to be searching for me by listening for my voice.`
`...I didn't know what her situation was... but it seemed Hanyuu and I were far away from one another... that we were immeasurably distant.`
`And as the crystal ball's light strengthened, I knew she was coming closer.`
`At first, the light I sensed from it had been faint.`
` But now, it was bright as a weak miniature light bulb, and I could clearly see it was shining.`
`".........Rika... What's going on...?!`
` I can't enter the world you're in...!"`
`"...What?!`
` What are you saying? I'm the one who needs help here!`
` I don't care how, just come here!`
` Take me out of this world!!"`
`"...Rika, please listen carefully.`
` For some reason, your world rejects me.`
` This should be impossible...!"`
`...Given that she's both a paranormal existence and a deity, I couldn't imagine any situation that would make her anxious enough for her to weakly say "this is impossible."`
`All I could do was keep on wailing half-insanely for her to do something, anything.`
`"B-But I can't do anything...`
` Au au au au!!`
` This is the first time...`
` This isn't possible...!!"`
`"Stop acting so miserable and hurry up and do something already!!`
` Anything!!"`
`"...I... I can't, Rika...`
` Your world is giving off a power that rejects me.`
` If you don't do something about that, there's nothing I can do...!"`
`"Stop saying things that don't make sense!`
` What do you mean, a power that rejects you? You're a deity! That can't be!"`
`"Y-You're right.`
` It can't be...!`
` But... There is no Fragment on this side..... so I can't line up the pieces...`
` I don't know how, but the Fragment is lost somewhere in your world...!"`
`"Fragment?`
` What do you mean?`
` Explain it so I understand!`
` I'll do anything I can!!"`
`Continuing to act so deranged won't help with anything.`
` I managed to figure out what Hanyuu wanted to say, and now I knew I had to eliminate the obstacle.`
`...The situation utterly escaped me... but it seemed like if I didn't do something, Hanyuu couldn't appear in front of me.`
`"I'm sorry for losing my composure.`
` I'll calm down now, so explain again, please.`
` What on earth is going on?!"`
`"...Rika.`
` I don't know why this is, but... part of a Fragment, which should be in the world of the gods, seems to be lost in the world you're in right now. `
`As an analogy, it's like the key you need to unlock a door being locked inside that room."`
`"What's a Fragment?"`
`"...What appears as the world to you is called a Fragment in the higher dimensions.`
` We've been connecting those Fragments like a jigsaw puzzle to walk between worlds."`
`"I see, I think I understand the analogy.`
` ...The world I'm in now is a Fragment...`
` a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, but something happened to the part that connects to the rest, and it won't fit with the pieces around it, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` That missing piece always has to be on this side...`
` but now, for some reason, it's on that side instead...!"`
`"The Fragments should be in the world of the gods, but for some reason it fell into the human world and now it's missing...?"`
`"That's about right.`
` ...Au au au..."`
`"All right.`
` I just have to do something about that Fragment, right?`
` ...I'll do what you say.`
` Where is that Fragment?`
` And what should I do with it?!"`
`"Ah,`
` ...u...`
` au au au au au..."`
`"I-Is this really the time to be 'au'ing?`
` Where is that Fragment thing?`
` And what does it look like?!"`
`"Au, au...`
` I... I don't know...!"`
`"What?!`
` How am I supposed to search for it if you don't know?!"`
`"I don't understand either...`
` From here, I can only hear your voice.`
` I can't interfere at all with that world as I am now...!"`
`"...But if it's called a Fragment, then will it look like a glowing piece of crystal like this?"`
`"I... I think...`
` that's probably right...`
` ...But I can't even imagine what shape it would take if something that belonged in a higher dimension ended up in the human world..."`
`I felt all my energy drain out of me, and I heaved a sigh...`
`"...We don't even know what it looks like...`
` ...This is the worst...`
` Anyway, if I do find it, what would I do?`
` How would I get it back into the world of the gods?"`
`"...Ah...`
` au au au..."`
`"You don't even know that...?`
` ...Haha...`
` Ha ha ha..."`
`"......I'm sorry...`
` It's the first time this has happened...`
` I...`
` I don't really know either..."`
`Ha ha ha... ha ha ha...`
`I laughed, mostly at myself... and before I realized it, I couldn't stop my tears from falling.`
`After getting sent to this crazy world... I don't even know how to get back...`
`Today, of all days!`
` I was in such high spirits, going to the pool with my friends.`
` That tiny fragment of happy days we'd all finally obtained after escaping the dead end of June 1983. `
`And just because I was messing around on the way back, just a little...`
` I got sent to this horrible world...!!`
`"......But if I'm going to complain about that... in the end, it's my own fault for not being careful on the road, isn't it...?"`
`"............Au au..."`
`I lost my balance on my bicycle, got thrown off... and then fell into the car there.`
`A common traffic accident.`
` A common death of a child.`
`...It just happened to be me this time.`
`The future I'd won after over a hundred years... Now, just because of that, everything was in pieces...`
`I could wail all I want... but the only thing at fault was my own carelessness.`
`In fact, I should be thankful to Hanyuu for letting me live.`
`......But sending me to a world like this... It's too cruel...`
`No, it wasn't as though Hanyuu sent me here because she wanted to...`
` I know that... I know that...`
`"...It's like you remember, Rika.`
` ...Our power has been wearing away.`
` And with the last of that power, we reached our victory.`
` ...So we were never supposed to be able to use it again..."`
`"You mean you used that power to save me...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` There was nothing else I could do.`
` ...Rika, your body flew off your bike.........`
` and if the dice had come up better, you might have fallen on the car and made it out injured, but alive.`
` ...But...`
` ......You were unlucky...`
` and when you flew off...`
` you landed... right in front of the car's tires......"`
`From Hanyuu's words colored with sadness... it felt like she'd watched me fly off, get run over by the car, and die...`
`"......Everyone...`
` had...`
` their mouths wide open...`
` in a daze...`
` The car's brakes screeched as it crashed into the guard rail, but nobody was listening.`
` ...And then...`
` Satoko...`
` She ran over to you...`
` but you... you looked...`
` ......au...`
` ............u... `
`......your face...`
` was gone...`
` ...uuuuu!!"`
`"...The car... crushed my head flat...`
` Ha ha ha... ha ha.`
` ...Chie was always talking about this, wasn't she?`
` ...Never to play in the road.`
` ......Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."`
`...I could imagine the rest of the story without Hanyuu telling me.`
`That fun day we had... was wiped out in an instant by my careless fooling around.`
`We dove together into the longest June 19, 1983 of these past hundred years...`
` and the peaceful future we finally reached through the sharing of countless miracles...`
` was wiped out in an instant.`
`My corpse was too horrible to look at...`
` Satoko came running over first...`
` and then everyone else came......`
` and they all wished they'd wake up from that nightmare...`
` until they lost all hope......`
` broke down, and wept...`
`Compared to that heart-splitting sadness...`
` the one who was actually careless grumbling about wanting to go home since this world was uncomfortable counted for nothing.`
`......Did that mean... in the end, it was all my own fault?`
`I'd struggled through so many years to reach that future, and I'd carelessly lost it by nobody's fault but my own.`
`...And I was blessed since Hanyuu was here for me, so I should be thankful.`
`Because if that had happened to someone other than me... they'd just lose their life, and nothing more.`
`Just the fact that there was hope, even if it was only a single, tiny ray, surely meant I was fortunate.`
`".........Thanks."`
`"...Au...?"`
`"...Idiots die in accidents from carelessness all the time in Japan.`
` ...And I was one of them.`
` I should have just died without complaints... but thanks to you, even though things have gotten strange, I'm alive. `
`...And I'm sure it will be really, really hard...`
` but there is still a way to return to that world."`
`"......Au."`
`"Let's review.`
` ......To bring me back to the original world, Hanyuu, you need to come here.`
` ...Right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Of course.`
` I want to return to the original world with you, Rika..."`
`"...Naturally.`
` We won that world after over a hundred years of struggle. We're going back.`
` ...I would spend another hundred years to do it.`
` ...I won't lose.`
` ...I won't lose heart...`
` ...Just for...`
` fooling around a little on the road...`
` and being sentenced to another hundred years...`
` That won't make me cry......`
` ...Uuu..."`
`"......Rika...`
` ...Even in the world beyond...`
` everyone is praying for you.`
` They're praying that... even if it costs them their lives, that you turn back time and make it so the accident never happened... `
`......I think those prayers...`
` were why I was able to find you, Rika..."`
`In this storehouse, in which I could smell only dust... I thought I caught the scent of incense.`
`...I couldn't see it, couldn't hear it...`
` but somehow I knew.`
`It was my funeral......`
` and I thought I could hear them...`
` my friends' heartbroken grieving over my coffin...`
`Their cries were incredibly sad... so sad, so painful, as though it would tear me apart...`
`I understood.`
` ...My carelessness...`
` It had destroyed not only my life, but everyone else's happiness...`
`"...I'll go back...`
` ...I'm going back...`
` I will return to that world no matter what...`
` ...uuu, no matter how narrow the path may be... I'll do it...`
` I'll go back for sure...!`
` Uuuuu!!"`
`My tears, filled with sadness mixed with determination mixed with saltiness, dropped to the floor...`
`"...Rika... Being locked in that world is the same as the dead end of 1983.`
` ...It may look like an inescapable fate... but you absolutely can escape it."`
`"I know...`
` Keiichi taught me that.`
` And even Takano taught me, too..."`
`Fate was thinner than a goldfish scooping net.`
`And strong enough feelings can reshape the future.`
`"That's right, Rika, that's the spirit...`
` Maybe it was because of your carelessness.`
` But you've been given the chance to atone for it and make it go away.`
` ...That's a really, really lucky thing."`
`"I know.`
` Normal people would be starting over in their next lives, but I alone got one last chance.`
` ......I know...`
` what that means..."`
`"...Rika.`
` ...I want you to somehow find the Fragment rejecting me.`
` I'll see if I can figure anything out in this world."`
`"I'll have to make do without any hints...`
` ...Also, as long as you aren't in this world, if I die here, that's the end, right...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` My power doesn't affect that world right now...`
` So please, Rika, be really careful...!"`
`"I know.`
` ......I'll never fool around on the road again."`
`"We don't have any hints, but... I'm this village's deity, and this village is all I've ever watched over.`
` ...If this power can interfere with me... then I think the power must be in the village too."`
`"...Somewhere in this village...`
` If it has anything to do with you, to be honest, I'd think it would be in this ritual implement storehouse..."`
`"Rika, is there anything in that storehouse that isn't in the usual worlds?"`
`"......I don't know. I can't tell right away.`
` There's no proof it would be obvious, right?"`
`"...If it's enough to interfere with me...`
` Rika, you've stepped into places incredibly close to the world of the gods before, so you might be able to sense it."`
`"Another thing to worry about...`
` I don't think anything on this altar, including this crystal ball, has changed, at least.`
` ......But this is a strange crystal ball. `
`It's interesting how, for a mere marble, it's on display in such an important place."`
`"Right now, you're holding the Furude Shrine treasure, the Kamu-no-Mikoto-no-Ri.`
` ......Long ago, when I performed a miracle at the Furude Shrine, I left it there as proof. `
`...After such a long time, most of the power inside is gone, but luckily for us, it's the only source of power I have that affects you. `
`......If it had more power... or if I could prevail against this, I might have been able to go to the world you're in..."`
`"...Which means... I'll only be able to talk to you with this crystal ball for a limited time."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Rika, can you hear my voice?`
` From here, your voice sounds like it's slowly fading away..."`
`"I get it. It's like a transceiver about to run out of battery power...`
` All right, I won't contact you unless it's important.`
` ...That way, we can talk for a little bit longer, right?"`
`"...Probably."`
`"Then that's enough.`
` I'll rummage around the storehouse now.`
` It could be hidden anywhere if it's the same size as this crystal ball.`
` ...And it might not be in the storehouse, either. `
`I'm going to need perseverance for this job..."`
`"...Rika... Please, do your best...`
` All I can do is stay here and cheer for you.`
` ...And... even the words I can use for that are limited now..."`
`"It's fine.`
` Mark my wordsâ€”I'll open the door to this world and invite you in.`
` I promise we'll go back to that fun world together.`
` So you do your best too.`
` If you learn anything that could be a clue, tell me."`
`"...I will."`
`"Then that's it.`
` I'm going to stop talking now.`
` ...See you again, Hanyuu."`
`"Au au au..."`
`"...I promise.`
` Once we get back to the last world, I'll fill the refrigerator with cream puffs for you."`
`"Au.`
` ...I'll...`
` look forward...`
` to...`
` that promise..."`
`Hanyuu's voice gently vanished... like water seeping into sand...`
`But that didn't mean Hanyuu had vanished.`
`...It was kind of like I was talking to Hanyuu on a public phone and my ten yen ran out.`
`We may have been in different worlds... but we were cooperating, trying to get out of this world and back to the last one.`
`...When I thought about it, Hanyuu had always been an ally in my life.`
`In this world, that ally was gone.`
`...Maybe that was a fitting punishment for wasting my life by being careless.`
`To get back to the last world... I would pile up as many stones as I needed to.`
`...For these were the banks of the River Styx.`
`Nirvana, from my viewpoint as one who had lost her life in the previous world.`
`But I'll get back... I swear... I'll get back there...`
`Then, suddenly, the inside of the storehouse brightened.`
`Someone had just turned on the switch for the naked bulb hanging from the ceiling.`
`And then, with a heavy clank, the door opened.`
`My father appeared there.`
` His face was like a demon's.`
`...Ah, that was right. I'd entered the cordoned-off ritual implement storehouse.`
`...I only received the right to enter the storehouse when I succeeded them as the head of the Furude family.`
` In other words, in a world with my parents alive, I wasn't allowed to come in here.`
`"Rika!!`
` How did you get in here?!`
` How many times have I told you never to enter the storehouse?!"`
`My father was in a rage.`
`Thanks to the property imprinted into one's very genes that made children tremble when their father looks at them with a scary face, I reflexively cringed with fear.`
`He grabbed me by the back of my neck and took me outside.`
`And then I ended up being disciplined, something I'd forgotten for a very long time.`
`...Ah, my parents being here is such a bother...`
`Just when I thought I'd been lucky that they made it through the year 1981, they're getting in the way of me returning to the final world...!`
`In the storehouse, I'd been shouting Hanyuu's name pretty loudly, so he'd probably noticed.`
`...I would investigate the storehouse for real tomorrow, but I'd have to take extreme caution so that my father didn't find me.`
`...In the middle of the night, unable to sleep face-up on my futon because of my rear end swelled up from all the spanking... I bit my pillow and cried again......`
` then thought back over what I had to do...`
`This was my room.`
`This was my futon.`
`...But this wasn't where I was supposed to sleep.`
`The futon I was supposed to go home to... was in the small house on the second floor of the renovated warehouse... the one next to Satoko's.`
`But in this world, the youth group was probably still using it as a meeting place.`
`...So my futon obviously wouldn't be there.`
`Then... what futon was I supposed to use in this world......`
`Punishment... for doing something stupid and careless, bringing the future we all won to nothing.`
`I needed to find what was keeping Hanyuu away so I could call her here.`
`It would take a lot of effort.`
`For that reason, I needed to build up my energy and get some sleep; shedding tears was nothing but a waste of time and stamina.`
`...I knew that... but until I fell asleep, I wept into my pillow......`
