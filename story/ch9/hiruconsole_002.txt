`"Hold on, Satoko~?`
` If you don't go shopping soon, you'll miss the special sales!!"`
`"Each customer can get one pack of eggs for ten yen!!"`
`"And a 6-pack of toilet paper is on sale for eight yen today, and it comes with a sample bath cleaner! And they say we get twice the stamps if we go before sundown!!"`
`"Come on, I came all the way down here because you said you needed help!!"`
`"...What on earth is going on, Rikaaa?`
` If we don't go shopping soon, we'll keep Shion waiting, you know?"`
`"...Meep, this is really bad.`
` Satoko, please take a look at this."`
`"...Oh, did something happen?`
` This incense burner is missing a foot."`
`Maybe it deteriorated over time from continued use, and that's why it broke off.`
`"It seems rather worn out.`
` Well, if that's the extent of the damage, we have lots of tools to easily fix it, so don't worry."`
`Do we have any more of that wood glue? Last time we bought some was when we needed to fix that chest of drawers...`
`"Meep, not that.`
` This incense burner was offered by my ancestors 200 years ago to seal something away.`
` And if it's broken, that means the seal is undone...!"`
`"...Somehow, it seems like a huge exaggeration to make a big deal out of a mere broken incense burner, but... What is it?`
` Is something terribly bad going to happen?"`
`"Meep...!`
`  According to the ancient texts, it's dangerous. If used in the wrong way, it could cause a huge disaster...!"`
`"Your ancestors went to the bother of sealing it, so... It must be bad, is that what you're saying?`
` Well?`
` How bad of a disaster might this be?"`
`"Meep, that's also written in the ancient texts.`
` It's all in kanji that are a bit hard to read... Can you read it, Satoko?"`
`"...Hmm, what do we have here?`
` The C-Calamity of the Magatama of Fuwarazu?`
` ...One Summer, which had... come earlier than most Years?`
` Th-the Magatama-of-Fuwarazu, two most v-va-valuable Jewels..."`
`"The Magatama-of-Fuwarazu, two most valuable Jewels, never to be removed from the Premises, spilled into the Worlde of Man and brought forth a most terrible Disaster.`
` ...That's what's written in the ancient texts. `
`And the way this is written, a lot of people were hurt back then."`
`"...The Magatama-of-Fuwarazu are valuable Jewels of Hell, left behind by the Savage-Gods. `
`Should they appear in the Human Village, the Hell-Daemons shall appear, possess its People, and create a hellish Portrait of Pandaemonium..."`
`" ...Which means there could be a terrible incident."`
`"...I don't really get it, but that sounds pretty bad. `
`...Speaking of hellish pandemonium, when Shion-san came here earlier with a lunch box full of pumpkin, she was like the devil himself, come straight out of hell."`
`"And what's worse, leaving 'just a little bit' behind meant facing the special Sonozaki tickle torture machine. Even just remembering it now... Yeeesh...!"`
`"It was pretty amazing to watch, though. Nipah~."`
`"Anyway, it has a wonderful power if used properly...  but, well, if you use it wrong, things get this bad."`
`"It's very dangerous, so my ancestors apparently sealed it away beyond the distant sky to place it far away from the human world."`
`"And now that the seal is broken, what happens?"`
`"Meep, that which is sealed above the sky will be unsealed..."`
`"So, it'll fall down somewhere in the village, then?"`
`"...But didn't you say it has a wonderful power if used properly?`
` It might be something I'd want to play with a little first~!"`
`"Meep...!`
` Anyway, find it, quickly.`
` If someone else finds it and figures out how to use it for evil, things could get really bad...!"`
`"...At times like these, the person who finds it and picks it up is always the one you least want it to be.`
` There's no way we can let some weirdo get their fingers on this Furude Shrine treasure!"`
