`*craaaack*`
`""Wh-whooooaaaaa!!""`
`All riiiight!!`
`The pitch was skillfully hit back, and was now coasting straight toward the home run zone on the right!!`
`However...`
`"...Ah, aaah~!`
` So close~~!"`
`The ball dropped just a few meters, no, just a few dozen centimeters too soon.`
`But it seems like I got the timing right, so I should be ready for the next one! All riiight...!!`
`"...Haah."`
`I was expecting Rena to feel threatened by that, but she had a smile full of pity on her face as she slipped off her glove and grabbed the bat, then spoke up.`
`"...I'm a little disappointed, Keiichi-kun.`
` Rena even went to the trouble of holding back to make it a more interesting game."`
`"Wh-what?!"`
`"Keiichi-san... that was a fastball.`
` And it was very precisely aimed."`
`Satoko seemed like she was struggling to speak as she commended Rena.`
`Shit...! Did my confusion about if it was going to be a breaking ball or a fastball prevent me from getting enough distance?`
`"If you can't catch up now, the results are plain to see.`
` And you better prepare yourself, because I'm going all out next time, all right?"`
`"...!!"`
`O-oh no...! It's sad to say, but right now there's just too much of a power gap between Rena and me!!`
`"D-damn it...!`
` Satoko, what should we do?`
` Do you know how to hit a slider?"`
`"I've only read about it in books.`
` I've never even played against someone who could throw a breaking ball like that in the first place...`
` How on earth can we... Oh!"`
`Just then... Satoko clapped her hands together like she'd just had an epiphany.`
`"Keiichi-san, Keiichi-san, would you please allow me to handle the next at-bat?"`
`"I have a most wonderful idea... Oh ho ho ho!"`
