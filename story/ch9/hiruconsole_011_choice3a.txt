`*tiiiing*`
`"...Foul!!"`
`The ball grazed the top of the bat as I swung, and then slammed into the net behind me.`
`I had the timing right, but... was that a straight pitch just now?`
`"...Timeout!"`
`Just then, Satoko jumped up and ran up beside me, with a look on her face like she couldn't take it anymore.`
`And then,`
`"...Keiichi, what do you think that last pitch was?"`
`"Huh?`
` Umm... a fastball?"`
`"Wrong!`
` That was another slider!`
` ...This is bad.`
` If it keeps up like this, we'll need to hit every single pitch...!"`
`"D-damn it...!`
` Satoko, what should we do?`
` Do you know how to hit a slider?"`
`"I've only read about it in books.`
` I've never even played against someone who could throw a breaking ball like that in the first place...`
` How on earth can we... Oh!"`
`Just then... Satoko clapped her hands together like she'd just had an epiphany.`
`"Keiichi-san, Keiichi-san, would you please allow me to handle the next at-bat?"`
`"I have a most wonderful idea... Oh ho ho ho!"`
