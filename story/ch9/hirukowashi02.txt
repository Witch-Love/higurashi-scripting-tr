`Today, our normally fun lunchtime was somehow lacking in excitement.`
`This was because Rena had been acting strange since this morning.`
`"You haven't looked good all day.`
` ...Are you feeling sick?"`
`"...No, I'm not sick.`
` ......Hau..."`
`"There's that sigh again.`
` Did you know that every time you sigh, a little more happiness is allowed to escape?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...Happiness...`
` ......Hau..."`
`It wasn't this bad when we first got to school...`
` Was she sick after all?`
`She'd been kind of dazed all morning, like she was running a slight fever.`
`"Do you want some cold medicine from the nurse's office?`
` The difference in temperature between day and night has been pretty extreme lately."`
`"...No, I'm okay.`
` ...Today, well... Could you leave Rena alone?`
` ...Could you?"`
`Rena said only that, her tone lethargic, before leaving our circle and going back to her seat.`
` Then, she rested her chin on her hand, stared out the window, and sighed again.`
`"Hm-hmmm?`
` From what this ol' man can see, it must be love!"`
`"L-L-Love?!`
` Awawawa, th-that's, well, oh ho ho, what a splendid occasion indeed!"`
`"No doubt about it!`
` Her mind's been somewhere else all day, filled with thoughts of a certain someone.`
` Putting your chin on your hand and sighing like that—isn't that exactly what a maiden in love would do?"`
`"You... you think...?`
` It looks to me like, well... that she's feeling sick because she swallowed something weird yesterday..."`
`"Something weird?"`
`"Hm?`
` Yeah. Yesterday, when we went treasure hunting.`
` ...Something, I don't know what, fell on her.`
` Then it popped right into her mouth and she swallowed it whole."`
`"So what, it fell from the sky?`
` Ahahahaha!`
` It must have been one of Cupid's arrows of love."`
`"......Fell... from the sky?"`
`As we were focused on our Rena discussion, Rika-chan, who had secretly planted a frog toy on Satoko's seat, pricked up her cat-like ears and turned around.`
` ...Those are just human ears viewed from the side, right? `
`I must be seeing things.`
`"...Keiichi.`
` What's wrong with Rena?"`
`"Well, get this.`
` Yesterday, she said that someone had dumped a new trash pile at the dam site, and we went treasure hunting there. `
`The usual stupid stuff happened, and right when she looked at the sky with her mouth open wide, something fell, dropped right into her mouth, and she accidentally swallowed it whole."`
`"......Something fell out of the sky into her mouth?`
` And she swallowed it?"`
`Hanyuu, did you hear that?!`
`"That... That can't be!`
` Au au au au!!"`
`Hanyuu being invisible was convenient at times like this.`
`As Rena breathed another sigh, her expression absentminded, Hanyuu went right up to her, held her hands above her head, and started trying to sense something...`
`"Ah, au au au auuu!!!"`
`"Eeek!!!`
` What did you just yell for?!`
` Wait, you mean..."`
`"A-A m-magatama is inside Rena!!`
` The magatama's power is inside her!!"`
`"Well, that makes things easy.`
` Want to try a drive-by gut punch?`
` ...Actually, her counterattack would kill me.`
` What about giving her a laxative?`
` ...Wait, this isn't a joke!!"`
`"It isn't that simple, au au!`
` It's not even shaped like a magatama anymore.`
` Rena ate it, so its form lost all meaning, and now its power resides in Rena!!"`
`"Which means what?`
` You can take a dose of magatama and absorb it through digestion?`
` What now? You were the one who created this item. Can't you do something?!"`
`"O-O-Of course I can do something!`
` If we get the red and white magatama together, then bring her to my sanctuary, the Furude Shrine grounds, I can chant a curse-removing charm and undo it!"`
`"Then it's simple!`
` Let's bring Rena to the shrine on the way home, and that'll be that!"`
`"But Rena only swallowed the red magatama!`
` Without the white one, I can't undo the curse!!`
` Rena will fall in love with whoever picks up the white magatama! `
`And if the red magatama's effects are appearing in Rena now, that means someone already did!`
` That person is now the only thing on Rena's mind!! `
`Au au au! If Rena goes out of control and does something she can't take back, a fait accompli, it'll ruin her whole life, au au au!!!"`
`"Why...`
` you...`
` little...!!!`
`You made these magic items! You better take responsibility!`
` Why the heck did you make something so dangerous?!"`
`"If you just use them properly, they have a wonderful effect! They can bond people in love!`
` Au au au!!"`
`"But they caused a huge disaster a long time ago, didn't they?!`
` Ahh, I get it now. I know exactly why my ancestors sealed them away!`
` You're such an inconvenient nuisance of a god!!"`
`"Ah, au au, but on the other hand, if it came undone like this, your ancestors didn't do a very good job sealing it! `
`When they sealed it, if they'd offered steamed buns or something to me like they were supposed to, it would have made the seal stronger!"`
`"Right, okay!!`
` Now you've said it! Offerings are important, right?!`
` Then since you can't eat them, I'll eat instead!!`
` The stuff we got at Seventh Mart for such a bargain yesterday, that is!! `
`The giant maximum spicy king-size kimchi!!`
` And I'll make a special version just for you...`
` where I mix together mustard and wasabi and tabasco sauce and pour it all on top!! `
`I'll be totally okay with that, but what about you?!"`
`"R-Rika, your sense of taste is crazy!`
` If you ate that, you'd burn your tongue off!!"`
`"And then I'll shove it all inside those cream puffs I got for you!!"`
`"Giiyaaahhhhhhhhh!!`
` Demon...`
` You're a demon,`
` a brute,`
` a monster!!`
` Stop it, stop it, au au au au au au!!"`
`"*giggle* Ku ku ku ku!!`
` It's too late to apologize!!`
` Eat this!!`
` ......Wait...`
` Meep?"`
`Suddenly, someone picked me up by the back of my shirt.`
` ...What am I, a kitten?`
` Meow.`
`I looked up to see Keiichi holding me.`
`"...I don't get what you're floundering around for.`
` But you know something, don't you?`
` Something about what happened to Rena!"`
`"...Meep?`
` Meep~♪"`
`"We'll need someone who speaks Meeplish to translate.`
` Which is it, yes or no?"`
`"She's faking innocence, which means she's guilty.`
` What did you do to Rena?!"`
`......Guess there's no point in pretending anymore.`
`Either way, I couldn't leave Rena like this.`
` I confessed to them and asked for their help...`
`"Sacred Furude Shrine treasures, the Magatama of Fuwarazu?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` Very amazing(ly annoying) treasures that bind people in love, whose name is said to mean 'not knowing discord.'"`
`"From the scroll's pictures... they just look like key rings with seals on them, don't they?"`
`"I agree.`
` Even if it hadn't fallen into her mouth, knowing Rena, she would have taken them home.`
` Why do these jewels look so adorable?"`
`"Fur seals are known for their vigorous reproductive habits, so I think I've seen them used on TV to symbolize passionate love."`
`"I see...!`
` That proves that fur seals were in Japan for hundreds or thousands of years, and even introduced to the Furude Shrine?!`
`I see... these might be some real out-of-place artifacts."`
`"But there's one thing that doesn't make sense!`
` Why would treasures like these fall out of the sky and into Rena's mouth?"`
`"...Nipah~☆..."`
`"Still, I'm a little surprised treasures that belong to Oyashiro-sama would bind people in love.`
` I always thought of him as someone who tormented and cursed people."`
`"People have been talking a lot about Oyashiro-sama's curse and stuff in recent years, which gave him a reputation for wickedness, but originally, he was a god of marriage.`
` Of course...`
` mainly, he'd curse you if you didn't get along."`
`"Oh, indeed.`
` I believe the Furude Shrine used to sell marriage charms!"`
`"So... this isn't just a story they tell about the magatama—they actually work miracles?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` At this moment, the power of the Magatama of Fuwarazu has taken root in Rena."`
`"Um, they were a red and white pair, right?`
` And whoever holds the red one falls in love with whoever holds the white one?`
` Sounds way more one-sided than a mutual love."`
`"...Yep.`
` Rena swallowed the red one, so no matter who picks up the white one, she'll fall for them.`
` Meep."`
`"Th-This is turning out to be a rather fantastic story!`
`...And to return Rena-san to normal, we need to find the white magatama?"`
`"Plus, given how she's acting, someone's already found the white one, right?!`
` If we leave this be, Rena's just going to fall deeper and deeper in love with them.`
` Regardless of how she really feels."`
`"Sounds romantic, but we have no clue what sewer the other person crawled out of. We can't have that.`
` All anyone has to do is pick it up to steal her heart, right?"`
`"...That's right.`
` They could be a child or an old person, a man or a woman—it doesn't matter.`
` To say nothing of a family member picking it up—that would be a disaster in a number of ways, nipah~☆"`
`"That certainly would not be good...`
` It would seem the situation calls for immediate action!!"`
`"It's a race against time.`
` And it still works if you eat it, so if a dog happened to walk by and gobble it up...`
` it would be a terrible thing."`
`"Th-Th-Th...`
` That...`
` well...`
` haha,`
` that would be...`
` terrible, huh...?"`
`"Er, urgh...`
` This ol' man, uh...`
` he'll pass on that kind of thing..."`
`"Why is that?`
` Would that not keep damage to a minimum if Rena-san could play with a dog??"`
`"...Satoko is still pure.`
` Pat pat☆."`
`"Anyway, we know these magatama magically deceive people's hearts.`
` We've gotta do something before it's too late!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Free will is important in love.`
` You can't force it with some magic spell or another!`
`...Even though that does seem a little romantic!"`
`"...Anyway, let's do something before it turns into a fait accompli.`
` If we don't, it'll become a real disaster."`
`"The problem is, who picked up the white seal?`
` Hinamizawa may be a rural village, but if we don't know who found it, there's nothing we can do!"`
`"Huh?`
` That's the easiest part!`
` The magic is making Rena fall in love with the person with the white magatama, right?`
` That person is all she's thinking about right now! `
`In other words, we just have to ask Rena herself!`
`Reenaaa~~!!!`
` This ol' man wants to know!`
` Just who is it that stole your heart, Renaaaa?"`
`...I'd seen Rena go into a frenzy more than a few times before, but this had to have been the longest one yet.`
`"...Ha... Hauuuu, I can't say it...`
` Hau~!"`
`"...W-Well, I figured as much.`
` Man, she got a lot stronger...`
` There's a lot more hits in her combo, too..."`
`"...I'm sure she'll be nerfed in the next patch.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"It will be fine, Mion-san.`
` It's just not right to ask a girl who she likes so directly!"`
`"......I'm sorry—this ol' man isn't a little girl, so he didn't understand..."`
`Ahhhhh, this is getting really annoying...`
`"Rena, of all people...`
` Didn't we know she could convert the love in her heart into raw attack power?`
` This is just getting worse...`
` Hey, you're directly responsible for this, so start thinking of a way to fix it!"`
`"Au au au, I'll think about it if you put that spicy demon away...!"`
`"...Oh, is that so?`
` Let's find out how many mouthfuls I need to eat before you come up with a bright idea!"`
`"I'll think about it!!`
` Au`
` au`
` au`
` ding!`
` I've got it!"`
`"...That was pretty lame... So, what did you come up with?"`
`Hanyuu pointed to Rena's seat.`
`...She was reading a book now, probably because she was tired from all the sitting around and staring out the window with her hand on her cheek.`
`Sometimes she left the horseplay aside and read a book.`
` It wasn't an unusual sight by any means.`
`"...But she still seems different.`
` She brought some books that aren't quite the same as her usual ones."`
`"What's the matter, Rika?"`
`"...Meep.`
` I'm watching Rena.`
` She might give us a hint."`
`"I wonder what she's reading.`
` I can't really tell from here..."`
`Having learned her lesson from Rena's attacks earlier, Mion was being careful to keep more distance than she had to.`
`"What is it?`
` Oh, I think it's a how-to book.`
` I wonder what she's learning about."`
`"Ah!`
` They're photographs!`
` It's a photography magazine!!"`
`"And she's got a camera catalog too!`
` There's only one person in Hinamizawa who matches those keywords!!"`
`"Yep, no doubt about it!`
` She even has the weekly supplemental peeping issue, Nurse Low Angle's special edition!!`
` There's only one person it could possibly be!!"`
`...The last item was the nail in the coffin, but anyway... Anyway, it meant it had to be that guy.`
`Geez, he's always just wandering around, so why does he end up being a key person in every single world?!`
`"Hau~ I wonder if he'd teach me how to use a camera if I asked him. If I did...!`
`I wonder if he'd go into great detail, if he would, if he would!`
` I wonder if he'd treat me nice if I dressed up as a nurse! `
`If I dressed up, dressed up, dressed up!`
` And then, and then, hau hau, hau~~~!!"`
`Rena calmly got out of her seat!`
`Hearts and flower petals filled her eyes, and doubtless you would see an even more amazing image if you peered into them.`
`"Hey, hey, Mii-chan!`
` Rena suddenly feels really sick, so she's going home early, hau~!!"`
`How brash!`
` Rena burst out of the classroom without waiting for school to end!!`
`"Ahhhh, Renaaa!!`
` Oh, Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun, perfect timing!!`
` Don't let Rena leave! Stop her!!"`
`"We can't do that!!`
` We saw what she did to the class president just now!!"`
`"...It does seem impossible even for all the club members at once to defeat her."`
`"We still can't let this happen!!`
` Satoko!!"`
`Mion snapped her fingers, and a single string dropped down from the ceiling, ending up in Satoko's hands.`
`"Oh, aye aye, sir!!`
` Take this!!"`
`Satoko yanked it! And that was when the jump-rope trap sprung into action near Rena's feet as she ran for the school entrance!`
`"First we'll make her trip, and then we'll all pile on her!!`
`Fugyah?!"`
`But before Satoko could finish, the jump rope tore with a loud ripping noise.`
` ...What superhuman strength to tear apart a nylon jump rope like that...`
`A mere jump rope was unable to stop Rena, and now she was already changing into her outdoor shoes at the shoe cubbies!`
`"Hey!!`
` No running in the halls!!"`
`"Sensei, I'm sorry, I'm going home early today~~!!`
`I'll invite you to the wedding reception!`
`Hau~!!"`
`"Wh-What?!`
` ...Hey, stop!`
`*moan* How did I let a student get ahead of me...?!"`
`"Wait, that's what you're upset about?!`
`W-We're leaving early too!`
` We have to find Tomitake-san before Rena does and get our hands on the white magatama!"`
`"That's our only option!`
` Let's search for places Tomitake-san might be!!"`
`"...Hanyuu!`
` Look for Tomitake using your ghost energy radar!"`
`"Au au, I don't like that name for it, but I can tell you he's on the shrine grounds!`
` And Takano is with him!"`
`"...Oh, wonderful.`
` Hooray for cliches!`
` Couples are always together at times like these, aren't they?`
` Mii, Tomitake should be at the shrine!!"`
`"You think so too, Rika-chan?!`
` I was just thinking that!!"`
`"But it looks like Rena-san is thinking the same thing!!`
` She's running towards the shrine!"`
`"What monstrous speed!!`
` She'll be out of sight in a flash at this rate...!!"`
`"All we can do is chase after her!`
` We have to do something before Rena starts hitting on Tomitake-san!"`
`"...When Takano gets jealous, the love triangle will be very awkward.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`I don't really care if the two of them break up, but it would be terrible if she vented her anger by putting her final plans into action right away!`
`Rena had already vanished out of sight.`
`But we couldn't stop here.`
` Our only choice, like Mion said, was to chase her down as fast as we could and keep casualties to a minimum!`
