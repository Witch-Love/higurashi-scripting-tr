`"And it's decided!!`
` Keiichi Maebara is in last place today~~!!!"`
`"Uwwoooohhhh!!`
` N-N-Not again!!`
` I lost agaaaaaain!!"`
`That was how it came to be that Keiichi Maebara once again played an embarrassing punishment game.`
`For the sake of his honor, we'll keep exactly how embarrassing it would be a secret for now...`
`"Nowaahhhhh!!`
` No, please, forgive me!!`
` Heeeeeee!`
` I can't get married anymooore!!"`
`"Why... Why can't I win...?!`
` I've been losing constantly lately.`
` I'm a punishment game regular at this point.`
` ...I-Is this it? Am I just everyone's dress-up doll now?!"`
`Keiichi was just experiencing firsthand what it meant to cry into one's pillow...`
`"Ahhh... God, Buddha, if you're out there, please, grant my prayers.`
` I don't want to have to lose these club games forever!`
` Please, grant me the power to never lose again...!"`
`Just then!!`
`"Don't be so distant, Keeeeeeeiiiiiiiii!!"`
`"God, Buddha, the Holy Mother?!`
` You pray to many—when you have other more reliable allies you could be asking first!"`
`"Exactly, nfu fu fu!!"`
`"Tomiiii!!`
` Cloud!!`
` And Iriii!!"`
`"""On the scene!!!"""`
`"Owah!!`
` Wh-What do you three want at this hour?!`
` I'm not gonna ask why you showed up from inside the ceiling for now..."`
`"Isn't it obvious?`
` We're siblings in spirit...`
` Soul Brothers!!"`
`"That's right, K!`
` Your worries are our worries!!`
` You were crying just now, weren't you?!`
` About how you can't win at club games lately!!"`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` We shall grant your wishes brilliantly!!`
` We will make you win!`
` We will give you the strength to win!!"`
`"U-Uwaaahn, everyone~!!`
` Thank you~~!!!!"`
`Squeeze!`
` The four men engaged in a tight group hug.`
`It was a touching scene of ardent friendship...`
`"I want to win, but I just can't.`
` I wonder why..."`
`"K.`
` Why do you want to win?`
` Do you want to win because you don't want to lose?"`
`"Well, yeah...`
` The punishment games have been escalating in embarrassment lately.`
` ...I just want to avoid being last place somehow..."`
`"That passive stance is the problem!`
`If you avoid last place, you won't have to play the punishment games, you say?`
` That lack of fighting spirit is the very reason you can't win!!"`
`"*sob*... *sob*... Y-You're right!`
` Right now, I'm not after first place.`
` I figure it's enough just to avoid the punishment games..."`
`"I see you've realized it.`
` At some point, your fear of the punishment games stripped you of your fangs of greed."`
`"When you regain those fangs, K, your true power will bloom once more!!!"`
`"You really are my seniors in life...`
` You're right...`
` But how am I supposed to get my fangs back...?"`
`"You lost your fangs because you were scared of the punishment games.`
`But if you think about it, you can also use that to get them back!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Cloud, that... What does that mean...?!"`
`"I'm...`
` talking...`
` about...`
` the punishment gaaaaames!!!"`
`"Take...`
` Mion-chan, for example.`
` She's the one who always dresses you in shameful outfits, isn't she?!`
` What if...`
` you dressed her up in those embarrassing outfits instead?!"`
`"Embarrassing things Mion made me wear...`
` ...`
`Yeah, I remember!`
` When she made me wear the school swimsuit!!`
` I'll remember that humiliation for my entire life!!"`
`"Yes!`
` Take revenge on her for that humiliation!!`
` Put Mion-san in a school swimsuit!!"`
`"Whoa, now, just making her wear it isn't enough.`
` What about making her go to class for an entire day with it on~?!"`
`"""Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!?!"""`
`"I-I thought punishment games were things you only had to endure for a few minutes.`
` ...B-By extending it to an entire day... What a wicked punishment game it would become!!!"`
`In Iri's delusions, he made Mion wear a school swimsuit and forced her to spend an entire day walking around in it.`
`"Wouldn't the impossible mismatch of wearing a school swimsuit with socks and shoes be delightful~?!`
` And while she wore it in class... wouldn't her face be bright red...?"`
`"Huooooohh!!`
` That's good!!`
` That's very good!!!"`
`It would be so embarrassing she'd spurt fire from her face,`
` but the rules of her own club were the one thing she couldn't break, so she'd have to endure the humiliation all through class.`
`Normally, I could always feel her joy at winning everything in her supremely confident expression.`
`"What do you think, K?!`
` Wouldn't a punishment game like that make you want to win?!"`
`"It does!!`
` It really does!!`
` Iri, you're amazing!!!"`
`"But this is only the start, K!`
` Now that you've realized the significance of beating Mion-chan, you can realize it for the other club members too!!!"`
`"""Yeeeah!!!!"""`
`"After Mion would have to be Rena."`
`"School swimsuits are nice, everyone, but I would definitely want to put her in maid clothes~!"`
`"Hmmmm, that's good, very good—I think maid clothes would suit Rena-chan!!"`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` Now, hold on, simply making her wear clothes doesn't amount to a punishment game!"`
`"Why, Cloud?`
` You think we should make her wear it in class too?"`
`Cloud waggled his finger and tsk-tsked, grinning.`
`"For this, you see...`
` you should have her help you eat a refreshing bowl of yogurt!"`
`"...What?`
` Cloud, how is that a punishment game?"`
`In Cloud's fantasy, K was making Maid Rena hold a short spoon in her mouth backwards.`
`And then, she awkwardly scooped up some yogurt with it, and brought it, trembling, towards the winner's mouth...`
`She wasn't using her hands, so the yogurt dripped down to make the spots around her chest and mouth dirty, and that by itself was an incredible image.`
`And as she brought the spoon in her mouth towards his face... close enough for him to feel her very breath...`
`When she put the yogurt in his mouth, their lips would meet over the spoon... Whoaaa!`
`"Mufufu, you know, that's a game they play at the shops with girls in them?`
` Maybe that was a little too stimulating for a minor like you, Maebara-san~~!!"`
`"C-Cloud~!!!`
` I never knew of any shops with that kind of game~~!!!"`
`"Mfu fu!!`
` You can leave all the naughty shops to me!!!"`
`"""Yeeeeeeeeeah!!`
` Cloud's the best!!!"""`
`"Great, then what should we do to Satoko and Rika-chan?!`
` That pair has done some terrible things to me before!!"`
`"For this, we'll want to use Angel Mort uniforms.`
` They keep making you wear them, so I bet you want to return the favor once in a while!"`
`"Ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` Just making them wear it wouldn't be fun, of course!`
`And so!`
` I have a good idea!`
` Here it is!!`
`Have them stand in for cleaning duty!!`
` Like wiping down the windows and such."`
`"Tomi, that's an interesting idea, but it's missing an important moe factor.`
` Why wiping the windows, anyway?"`
`In Tomi's fantasy, Satoko and Rika were forced to change into S-size Angel Mort uniforms.`
`Satoko hadn't thought she'd end up wearing something like that, and she'd glare at K with a bright red face, struggling to hide her embarrassment.`
`Then, they would carry a desk to the window, and climb up on top.`
`"And this is the important part.`
` We get them to wipe the windows...`
` with their butts!!!"`
`Pffft!`
`Bright red mist spurts from the noses of K, Cloud, and Iri.`
`In their fantasy, the two of them had never even considered being made to do this in those uniforms, and even Rika-chan had her gaze downcast in embarrassment.`
`...And then, the both of them would use their butts to wipe in circles...`
` *squeak*`
` *squeak*`
` *squeak*`
`According to Tomi, the windows part was important.`
`In other words...`
` you could see them from everywhere outside the windows!!`
`As expected of a photographer!!`
` His obsessions were something else!`
`"How's that?!`
` How do you like the punishment game I thought of?!"`
`"""Tomi!!`
` Tomi!!!`
` Tomi!!!`
` The greatest!`
` WOOOAHHHHHH!!!"""`
`"Oh, and now that I think of it, I owe quite a bit to that Shion, too!!!"`
`"Very good, very good!`
` Let's think of a revenge punishment game for her that will heal K's bitterness!!"`
`"Mfufu~!!`
` Well, the Sonozaki siblings have real nice figures!`
` They make me want to work hard!"`
`"I'd lean towards taking off clothes, rather than putting them on~!!`
` One option is to have her remove one article at a time, just like Ryuugu-san made you do once!"`
`"...Hm!`
` Everyone, I've just had a spark of inspiration!!`
` Please, hear out this idea of K's!!!`
`First, we have Shion put on a school swimsuit."`
`"You made Mion-chan wear one too.`
` There's nothing amazing about that, though."`
`"Tsk tsk tsk!`
` Tomi, don't rush the answer!`
`And then, on top of that...`
` we have her put on a full gym uniform.`
` Then we make her strip!!`
`We'll have her only take the gym shorts off halfway, though!!!"`
`"""M-M-My mind cannot comprehend such a collaboration?!?!"""`
`In K's fantasy, Shion, decked out in a gym uniform, was on her knees, face bright red.`
`And... unable to disobey the winner's commands, trembling, she took her gym shorts halfway off...`
`The school swimsuit's bottom peeked out from the half-removed shorts!!!`
`Normally girls weren't embarrassed about the exposure from a school swimsuit...`
` but by having her take the gym clothes off to reveal it, the swimsuit gains an impossible moe factor!!`
`"What an incredible combination, K!!!`
` An impossible, absolutely impossible pairing of clothes, but you drew out the strong points of each, giving us Shion's ultimate form!!"`
`""A-Amazing, Keeeeeeeeeeeeeiiii!!`
` Wooaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!""`
`"Ahh... Ahem. Everyone?`
` I know she's not a club member, but since we're thinking about punishment games, let's think up one for Takano-san~~!!"`
`"Hmmmmm!!`
` You're right—her sensual figure is perfect for punishment games!!"`
`"But... Takano-san seems cool and collected... She'd be able to withstand a regular one."`
`"Which just means this, K!`
` We'll just have to come up with an even more amazing punishment game!!"`
`"Ku-ooohhhhhhh!!`
` This is really getting me fired up!!`
` Ahh, crap, what kind of punishment game should we take to Takano-san?!"`
`"I've got it.`
` I think her voluptuous figure would, to say the least, fit well in a bunny suit."`
`"Hmmm... Shops with bunnies...`
`Oh, yes—`
` the kind where they hold the lighter in their cleavage!`
`We can't leave that out!!"`
`"But Cloud, his club is a school event, so wouldn't cigarette-related tools be a bit risky?"`
`"Hm!!`
` Tomi, that's it!!!`
` We could just have her put something from the school in there!!`
`You know how they have recorders, right?!"`
`"Ahhh!!`
` Recorders, yes, I see!!`
` W-We'll put that... in Takano-san's rule-violating chest...`
` her cleavage...`
` in the middle of it!!!"`
`Recorders are long. They're definitely long enough.`
` So then,`
` she holds it in her breasts,`
` then wraps her tongue around it like this~~!!`
`"Whoa, you're saying you'll make Takano-san do that?!!?`
` ......I...`
` I actually...`
` have a recorder.`
` Maybe I'll secretly test it out..."`
`"Urgh, don't get ahead of the pack, Tomi!!`
` Aren't we Soul Brothers?!`
` Now that I think of it, our old man has a shakuhachi, so maybe I'll bring that!!"`
`"Hmmmm!`
` I've played flute for a long time—would that be OK...?"`
`"""It's more than OK!!!!"""`
`"Oh, we mustn't forget.`
` There's Chie-sensei.`
` As an instructor who teaches discipline, she'd never be able to go against the rules of a punishment game!!"`
`"Ch-Chie-sensei?!`
` ...Our teacher playing a punishment game...`
` I'd never even thought of that..."`
`"Nfu fu!`
` Chie-sensei is your teacher, K, which let her through your woman filter~`
` But Chie-sensei is wonderful!!`
`There are no gaps in her symmetrical body!!`
` If Takano-san has a demonic allure, then Chie-sensei's charm is pure and angelic!! `
`Imagining the body hidden under that summer dress is the final paradise of intellectual imagination allowed to us middle-aged men!!"`
`"...Uh... When you talk about her like that... I feel like I'm gonna be too embarrassed to look her in the face tomorrow..."`
`"What's wrong, K?!`
` How pathetic—weren't you the one who just devised such a shameful punishment game for Shion-chan?!`
` Not seeing someone as a woman merely because she's your teacher...`
` It looks like you need to study up a bit more!!!"`
`"Chie-sensei... Her butt sure is attractive."`
`"Mm... *gulp*.`
` Yes, that tightness... it is good!!`
`Iri, you have quite an eye for these things yourself!!`
` As expected of the school doctor~~!!"`
`"The first important thing is to destroy her sanctuary of teacherhood!!`
`So how about this?!`
` We put Chie-sensei at a podium in front of all the students...`
` and demand to see her butt?!?"`
`"""Ugyaaaahhh!!!!`
` Wait, Tomi, that's the kind of situation you'd seen in Fr*nce Publishing House's female teacher series!!!"""`
`"Ah, I-I-I apologize—not demand to see her butt, to see her do something with it.`
`...Remember back when you were a kid?`
` Drawing letters with your butt for punishment games?"`
`"I see!`
` We'd make her do that in front of the whole school, even though she's a teacher!`
` Humiliation play~~!!!`
` Tomi, our interests are aligning more and more by the day!!"`
`"...Ku-ku-ku-ku!`
` Tomi, Iri, don't you think there'd be a little something missing with only that?"`
`"Hmm, K.`
` Then what sort of other option would you propose we add?"`
`"Ku-ku-ku!!`
` We have Chie-sensei hold that embarrassing pose for 30 minutes...`
` and have her be a model for a giant school sketching competition!!!"`
`"""A-A-A-A-A giant!!`
` School!?!`
` Sketching competition!!"""`
`"Th-That's amazing, K!!!`
` No cameras, right?`
` It has to be sketching, right?!"`
`"Hmmmm, fine arts go so well with the autumn season that it's driving me crazy!!!"`
`"Yes, Chie-sensei's butt is definitely the part to go with..."`
`"Do you see it, everyone?`
` This is a punishment game!!`
` It's only a punishment if we go that far!!!"`
`"""Keeei!`
` Keeei!`
` Keeei!!!`
` Yeeeeahhhhh!!!"""`
`"Thank you, everyone!!`
` I finally want to win now.`
` You made me remember how sweet victory can taste!!"`
`"This is as far as we can help you!!`
`K, all that's left is for you to seize victory!!"`
`"Yes, but I won't be seizing it alone.`
` We will be!!!!`
` With the power of our fantasies!!!!"`
`At that moment, Keiichi felt his power rising high enough to reach the heavens.`
`Overwhelming power, enough to walk out in the rain and dodge raindrops, or walk on the sea and have it part ways for him!`
`Thus, on the next day.`
`K, wielding his powers fit to give him the nickname "the Dark King," realized one fantasy punishment game after another.`
`None of the club members had any way to match his overwhelming strength.`
`All of Mion's plans failed,`
`and even Rena's kyute mode couldn't come close.`
`Satoko's traps were no more than sparrow snares set for an elephant.`
`And the only thing Rika could do was pat the heads of her defeated friends.`
`The club members could no longer break out of the situation!!`
`Mion, realizing this, asked Chie-sensei for help,`
` but K, filled to the brim with his fantasy power, beat her with no more effort than twisting a baby's hand!`
`"B-But that's...!`
` This punishment game is just too much!`
` Maebara-kun, can't you make it something else?!"`
`"Hmmm~~~~ Chie-senseiiii?`
` Your job is to teach us to obey the rules, and now you want to bend them?`
` Hmm~~~??`
`All you have to do is stick your butt out and draw figure-eights with it. `
`During drawing class tomorrow~!!`
` You just have to be a model for our sketches."`
`"B-But... That's... that's so embarrassing...!`
` You're being too cruel, Maebara-kun...!"`
`Compared to the club members, who were prepared to some extent for the punishment games, Chie-sensei seemed to be quite resistant to them.`
`...But even as she stubbornly refused, she couldn't go against the ultimate rule of this club's world, the absolute right of the victor to make any command... and her mind gradually gave in.`
`Clatter!!`
`Just then, the principal threw open the classroom door.`
`Everyone believed that the school's most powerful joker had come to the rescue.`
`But from his mouth came the most unexpectedly strict words...!`
`"Hmm.`
` If both parties are in agreement, then that's that.`
` As a teacher, Chie-sensei, you must obey the rules and play the punishment game.`
` Yes, yes."`
`"Ku-ku-ku-ku... Principal~~!!`
` I knew you'd understand!!"`
`"...Oh, no~`
` ...I thought for sure the principal would overcome this situation with his fists of steel!"`
`Even upon seeing this amazing sight of all the club members dressed in their grand punishment game outfits, the principal remained calm and collected.`
` ...As expected of him.`
`"Hmm. Now then, Ryuugu-kun.`
` What kind of punishment game will this be?"`
`"...Umm... What was it again?"`
`Rena turned to Satoko and Rika, all of them tilting their heads in wonder.`
`"Um... umm!`
` It was... sticking out her butt, and... what?"`
`"No, that wasn't it, Rena-san.`
` He was saying something about doing sketches."`
`"...In other words, Keiichi is extorting Chie's butt."`
`The last sound Keiichi heard was the sound effect of the principal using his level three special...`
`"Let this be a lesson to you!`
` Enjoy your fantasies on your own time!`
` Don't push them onto other people!"`
`"...Uuu, I'm sorry, Sensei...`
` I'll be more careful from now on..."`
`After that, it is said Keiichi upheld that lesson and kept his fantasies to himself to enjoy.`
`"...Uehehehehehehehehehe~~~~☆"`
`"Maebara-kun!!`
` Please don't laugh in such a creepy way during class!!`
` And please, don't look at your teacher with those eyes...!"`
`Today was another day of pure bliss for K☆`
`"Did you all enjoy the bonus story?`
`It was kind of a lewd one...`
` I wonder if this was all right..."`
`"Still, I get the feeling Kei-chan got to see all the good stuff in this one!"`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` It ended terribly for me as always, but I certainly liked it!`
` Punishment games are the best~~!"`
`"I... I wish you would put yourself in our shoes, abused by a man's unhealthy desires!"`
`"E-Even if it was all in his imagination... I think there were a little too many lewd punishment games. Too many..."`
`"Too many? I'm pretty sure ALL of them were lewd.`
`Half-stripping a gym uniform with a school swimsuit underneath is simply too suggestive."`
`"...Satoko and I were both played with like toys."`
`"Wiping a window with our butts? Disgraceful! It would never happen!!"`
`"I... with my mouth... spoon... yogurt...`
` *thump* *thump* ...Hau~..."`
`"Crap!`
` You're all lucky your punishment games were short!`
` I would have had to wear a swimsuit all day!`
` This was clearly unfair to me!"`
`"C-Come on, everyone.`
` Don't blame me...!`
` I was just following the script!`
`Still, I'd love to see this situation again in the main story sometime!!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"Keiichi-kun does go through a lot of trouble in the main story...`
` Maybe a fantasy event like this is okay once in a while, while..."`
`"...He can only feel good in his fantasies.`
` So sad, so very sad."`
`"Even his fantasies were a huge bother to us!!`
` I'm getting really angry now!"`
`"Hmm.`
` That means we need to use our fantasies to take revenge for his."`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` Makes sense to me!`
` I don't care what you do in your thoughts.`
` Give me whatever punishment game you want inside your own minds!`
` It won't hurt or itch even a little~!"`
`"Shion-san... It simply doesn't feel entertaining enough to get revenge in only our fantasies."`
`"Satoko~ No, no, that's not it.`
`Let this be a strategy meeting to figure out what we'll make Kei-chan do next time he loses!"`
`"Ahahahaha, I get it.`
` You're saying we should do the same thing Keiichi-kun and the others did in this story!"`
`"In that case, that does sound entertaining!`
`If we think of a fabulous game, it will be even more fun to beat Keiichi-san."`
`"That's right.`
` Our fantasies will be our fuel for tomorrow.`
` For now, let's give it a try."`
`"...Go for it, yay."`
`"What he made me do`
` was spend the whole day in a school swimsuit.`
` What would be good in exchange?"`
`"They do say an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.`
`...Then should we have Keiichi-kun...`
` spend the day in a school swimsuit too...?`
` The whole day...?"`
`"Ho-ho-ho-ho!!`
` I can just picture Keiichi-san's misery!!"`
`"Spending a day all red, half-sitting, looking down, trying desperately to hide how his lower regions' pole is standing...`
`Ku-ku-ku, that wouldn't be so bad."`
`"...Keiichi-kun all red and flustered...`
` Together all day with him in a school swimsuit...`
`...His fertility, so kyute... Hau~~!!!`
` I'll take it home with me~~!!"`
`"......I think I would still rather see him wear a maid outfit."`
`"No, come on, Rika-chan! A school swimsuit is more cruel—it wouldn't hide his body lines!`
`His lordly, boyish circumstances would be on full display~~!!"`
`"Lordly circumstances, shaking and swaying... pfwahhh...`
` Hau~~~☆"`
`"I agree with Mion-san's opinion.`
` Maid outfits are a little cliche, aren't they?"`
`"......We'll make him wear maid clothes, then play in a game for Coach."`
`"A Hinamizawa Fighters game?!`
`...That could... Rika-chama, you're good.`
` I can't tell whether it's more gross or more cruel."`
`"M-Making him play a game for Coach in a maid outfit would be like tying a goat up by the legs and leaving it out as shark food...!!"`
`"I'm kind of interested in how Coach would react!`
`Okay, let's do a simulation!!`
` Fantasy mode, switch on!!"`
`"Ma...Maebara-san...!!!!`
` Wh-What on earth are you wearing?!!?"`
`"""Chatter chatter chatter chatter!!!"""`
`"Er, you see!!`
` This, uh, it's... It was a punishment game for club, and...`
` I-I-I'm sorry, I promise I'm not trying to make fun of this baseball game!"`
`"Clearly he's not serious in that outfit.`
` It's an insult to baseball!"`
`"No... I, I promise I wasn't..."`
`"We're not feeling it today, Hinamizawa Fighters!`
` Let's just call today's game a draw!"`
`"......Ah... I......"`
`As Keiichi cowered, Coach, with a resolute expression, cut between him and the others.`
`"...Everyone, please, quiet down! `
`Nowhere is it written in the baseball sportsmanship mentality that you're not allowed to play baseball unless you wear a uniform.`
` It is said that back when Japanese baseball had just gotten past the war, they didn't have matching clothes, and some players wore their military uniforms. `
`What matters is your mentality! `
`Besides, they say you can trace baseball's roots back to 18th-century England.`
` And when you think England, you have to think of...`
`Maids.`
` Yes, maids.`
` Maid culture, along with`
` the Nile,`
` the Indus,`
` and the Euphrates,`
` are the four major civilizations`
` that even elementary schoolers know these days. `
`In a way, this maid clothing from maid culture, born in the same place baseball culture was, is much more in line with tradition than our uniforms,`
` which you call the proper clothing of baseball!!!"`
`"""Yeaaaaahhhhhhh!!!`
` Coach!`
` Coach!!`
` Coach!!!"""`
`"""It doesn't matter what we wear!!`
` Start the game already!!"""`
`Smash, roooar.`
`Swoosh, roooar roooar!`
`"Maebara-san is next in this gambling ring.`
` As you know, the Hinamizawa Fighters and the Okinomiya Titans have a long rivalry.`
`If you mess up your chance at bat, you won't be getting off lightly."`
`"...Uu... I'll do the best I can, but... I can't promise I'll hit it..."`
`"How sad.`
` A maid sworn to absolute obedience by their master should never say such things.`
` If you strike out during your chance at bat..."`
`"...Wh... What'll happen...?"`
`"I would need to punish you.`
` ...The act of coming out in a proper maid outfit and losing is the same as insulting both cultures, baseball and maids, at the same time.`
`And in that case...`
` I would, of course, punish you in the English way."`
`"...What's the English way?!`
`asks Kei-chan, trembling. Coach grins like a cold-blooded reptile, then strokes Kei-chan's waist as he whispers into his ear."`
`"Wha, what could the English punishment be, what could it be...`
` Hauuu~~..."`
`"Kei-chan steps up to the batter's box, grips his bat, and notices something.`
`Oh no—the bat has been tampered with! There's no way he can hit it now!`
`Yes, he's fallen into Coach's trap.`
` At this rate, Coach will have his way with Kei-chan's chastity...!!"`
`"Wait, hey, wait, hold on, Shionnnn!!!`
` I stayed quiet and listened this whole time, but now things are getting out of hand!"`
`"Oh, come on, Kei-chan, don't get in the way!`
` This is all just a fantasy.`
` It doesn't have anything to do with the real you, Kei-chan!"`
`"That's right!!`
` This is simply a few girls getting together to talk about their wildest dreams.`
` Is this not the exact same thing as when you and the boys got together?"`
`"Well... Yeah, I guess, but... Even if these are just daydreams, I still can't pretend I didn't hear that."`
`"......If you want to hear it, you can sit on a chair and listen.`
` ...Nipah~☆"`
`"I want to talk about other punishment games too!`
` Oh, yes, weren't you talking about how much you liked bunny girl outfits, Keiichi-san?"`
`"And wiping windows with our butts, if I recall...?`
` Kei-chan, you came up with some pretty amazing things too, hmm?"`
`"It wasn't me!!`
` And you're getting them a little mixed up!`
` And those were Tomitake-san's and Ooishi-san's ideas!!`
` I mean, I guess I'll admit I got carried away, but..."`
`"Hau~!!`
` It doesn't really matter who thought of it!`
` Keiichi-kun in a bunny suit would be so kyute...☆"`
`"Then let's go see it.`
` Fantasy mode, switch on!!"`
`"...Damn...!`
` This was an embarrassing outfit to begin with!`
` And now... wiping the window with my butt?!`
` Damn... If I don't hold the chest up, it'll come right open and embarrass me more...`
` Gah, I feel so miserable I could cry.`
` ...All right, here we go... *squeak* *squeak*"`
`Snap snap snap!!!`
`Snap snap snap snap snap snap!!!`
`"Owaahhhh!!`
` Wh-What were those flashes?!`
` Super rapid-fire photography! Hundreds of pictures per second!!`
`T-Tomitake-san?!`
` Gyahhhh, please, stop! You're taking pictures of me like this?!?`
` I thought you were a wild bird photographer!!`
` When did you switch to bunnies?!?"`
`"K-Keiichi-kun, don't misunderstand.`
`I really am a wild bird expert.`
` At this very moment, too, of course!"`
`*snap* *snap* *snap*!!!`
`"Explain to me what birds you're taking pictures of right now!!`
` What are you zooming in on with that magnifying lens?!?"`
`"Have you ever heard of people calling wild boars 'mountain whales', Keiichi-kun?`
` Whales obviously don't live in the mountains.`
` But people in the Edo period said there were whales swimming in the mountains, and their meat was highly prized.`
`Ha-ha-ha. They say it was actually boar meat. `
`They were forbidden for religious reasons from eating animal meat.`
` But if it was a whale, it was fish meat—meaning technically, they were allowed to eat it."`
`*snap* *snap* *snap*!!`
`"Now, don't hide yourself with your hands!`
` Wipe the window with your butt! Wipe it!"`
`"I... I think I can see where this is headed, but could you please stop with all that snapping?!?"`
`"That's right—bunnies are rabbits.`
`And rabbits, too, were called relatives of birds in the Edo period.`
` It was the same as the mountain-whale.`
` They said that technically, rabbit meat was actually bird meat, so they were allowed to eat it!`
`Yes, in other words, bunnies are relatives of birds!`
`That means that even if I found you through my viewfinder, there's no problem at all!!`
` Hurry, there's still more to wipe!"`
`*snap* *snap*!!!`
`"Even I know rabbit stew was super popular for Edo people... but their culture doesn't have anything to do with you taking embarrassing pictures of me!!!`
` Besides, aren't chefs the people who should be concerned with rabbit stew?!`
` Tomitake-san, you're a cameraman! You're twisting this too far!!"`
`"You just don't get it, Keiichi-kun!!`
` I'm a cameraman, but sometimes I think I'm a chef behind my viewfinder!`
` If I didn't roll up my sleeves when enticing, mature rabbit meat is in front of me, I'd be a disgrace to chefs everywhere!!`
`Right now, I've obtained the greatest ingredient—you—and I'm hard at work on the best recipe of my life!!!"`
`"Gyaaahhhhhh!`
` Someone stop this pervert cameraman!!!`
` Peeping photos are not cool!!`
` I'm morally against low-angle photography!!"`
`"Dwahhhhhh!!`
` Say what you like, but you're heartless!!`
` This is way beyond punishment game territory now!!!"`
`"Ohh-ho-ho-ho!`
` I did say this was a fantasy earlier, didn't I?`
` This isn't doing you any real harm, Keiichi-san!"`
`"Yes it is!!`
` Those grins you keep looking at me with, those suspicious eyes—it's like they're licking me, and it tickles!!"`
`"Come on, you can't lick people with your eyes.`
` Ku-ku-ku!`
` Fantasies are simple thoughts.`
` Freedom of thought is the number-one guaranteed right we have in post-war Japan~~!!"`
`"...But, you know~~☆`
` I don't know if just fantasizing about it is enough~~☆`
` I can't wait for the next club session~~~!!`
`Hau~~~!!!`
` Keiichi-kun going squeak-squeak with his butt.`
` Hau~!!`
` I'm taking you home with me~~!!!"`
`"Oh-ho-ho!!`
` I will think of some amazing trap ideas!`
` No matter what, I'll make Keiichi-san do them for these punishment games!"`
`"Sis, promise to call me for your next club session.`
` We'll rally the combined might of the Sonozaki sisters and win a complete and total victory!"`
`"......No day would be more of a nuisance than the one the Sonozaki sisters joined forces."`
`"We'll have to get Ooishi involved too~!`
` What was it, a punishment game where you make Rena eat yogurt?"`
`"Ah, and it's boring how Satoshi-kun has been missing from all this.`
` Now that we're on the subject, if we get Satoshi-kun and Kei-chan to take turns spoonfeeding each other yogurt......`
` Pfft!!`
` Almost had a nosebleed..."`
`"D-Damn it! I'll remember this!!!!"`
`"Um... well... we don't have a choice, Keiichi.`
` ...We lost."`
`"Damn it, damn it!!`
` I couldn't afford to lose this game!`
` Your rookie mistake midway through really cost us...`
` If not for that, we could have recovered!!"`
`"I...`
` ...S-Sorry."`
`"...N-No, that's... You're not the only one to blame, Satoshi.`
` I'm responsible too, for not realizing my mistake.`
` ...I said too much.`
` I apologize."`
`"Today we may have lost.`
` But with the two of us together, we can win next time."`
`"............Ah... Yeah, y-you're right!`
` We'll just have to admit defeat today and do our best next time...!`
` Hahahaha..."`
`"Then, uh... Let's get this punishment game over with.`
`I'll start.`
` I just have to put the spoon in my mouth, scoop up yogurt, and feed it to you, right?`
` ......Mgh...... Mm~~~~~~~~~..."`
`"..............Agh...... uh..."`
`"...What's wrong... Keiichi?`
` If you don't eat it soon, my jaw will get tired..."`
`"......No, I just......... It's just a little... Well, two men having to do this, it's... embarrassing..."`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` Keiichi.`
` I think the whole point of the punishment is to be embarrassing.`
` So if we do it without getting embarrassed, maybe it'll go a lot more quickly."`
`"...Well... Maybe.`
` ...Acting embarrassed like that would just amuse them more... Right...`
` ......But... Still, I don't know..."`
`"We just have to spoonfeed each other once, and that's it.`
` Let's get it over with and call it quits."`
`"...I know that logically, but... well...`
` ...Going all-out like that... it's...... embarrassing........."`
`"...I...... To tell you the truth, doing this with you, Keiichi... it embarrasses me too."`
`".........Huh...?`
` Oh...... Your hand..."`
`"...See?`
` ...My heart's been pounding since we started.`
` So... I want to get it over with quickly.`
` Because if we don't, I'll............"`
`"......Satoshi......... I......"`
`"Do you not want... to eat my yogurt...?`
` ...If it were me... and your yogurt, Keiichi... I'd... want to eat it..."`
`"Woahhhhhhhhhh, Satoshiiiii!!`
` Ahh, and so they took their first step on their road to forbidden love!"`
`"Graaahhhh!!!`
` Please don't wrap Nii-nii up in your strange punishment games!!!`
`Grah?!`
` Au au au ah...!"`
`"Wow, Rika-chan, what's that? Chloroform?"`
`"......Meep~`
` It was just getting good, so I wanted Satoko to quiet down."`
`"Rika-chan is scary sometimes with how merciless she is.`
` ...Ahahahahaha..."`
`"Hau?!`
` Wait, where did Keiichi-kun go?!`
` Someone other than Rena took him home!!!`
` No fair, no fair, no fair!!!"`
`"Ooishi-san, are you there?`
` You've got a civilian call on the outside line."`
`"Wh-Why can't I declare ron?!`
` Ah, wait, please, Ooishi-saaan!"`
`"Whoops, thank you.`
` I'll be back in just a bit!"`
`The man sitting across from Ooishi was waggling a receiver at him.`
`"It's the outside line.`
` From a payphone."`
`"Ahh, I'm terribly sorry!`
` ...This is Ooishi—sorry for the wait.`
` Who is this?"`
`"I-Is that you, Ooishi-san?!`
` Hello?!"`
`"Well, if it isn't Maebara-san.`
` Hello, and what can I do for you today?"`
`"...I... At first, I thought this was going to be an ordinary afterparty.`
` ...But ever since it started, it's gotten very, very strange!!"`
`"Please, calm down, Maebara-san!`
` I'll send a patrol car over to you now!`
` It'll be there in three minutes, so do your best to hang on until it gets there!!"`
`"Three whole minutes?`
` I'm already surrounded...`
` Gya-gyah!!`
` Please stop!!!`
` Or at least be gentle with me!!!"`
`"Hold still already! For a man, you really don't know when to give up!"`
`"Somebody help!!`
` Moommmmm!!"`
`"Hau-au, Keiichi-kun is so cute when he's struggling~~`
` I'm taking you home with me!!!"`
`"*loud noises* You were caught in my trap the moment you fled to this phone booth~!"`
`"Squeeze~~~~~!!`
` Urghrhghgh... *thud*"`
`"Hello?!`
` Are you there?!`
` Can you hear me, Maebara-san?!"`
`I knew all too well how distant the voice beyond the receiver was.`
`Yet... I couldn't help but shout anyway.`
`And then, from the other end of the phone... I could hear a faint murmur.`
`"...Nipah~☆"`
`I don't know what he's talking about.`
`...Based on his tone of voice... was he talking to himself?`
`Or... was he speaking to somebody there?`
`I sharpened my senses... hoping to hear something more...`
`What was he trying to convey...?`
`What on earth... could it be...!?!`
` *click*`
` *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* ...`
`The line abruptly cut off. ...Did the 10-yen coin run out?!`
`It was a pay phone, after all...!!`
`"......Ah."`
`And because it cut off so suddenly.`
`...His last words vividly lingered inside my head.`
`"'...Nipah~☆', he said."`
`Just then, I had a feeling.`
`......That there was no longer any need to be in a hurry.`
`That was how one unlucky boy found himself swallowed in Hinamizawa's darkness once more...`
