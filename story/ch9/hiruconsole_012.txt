`According to Rika-chan, the Magatama of Fuwarazu wouldn't take effect until after a short period of time.`
`By the time we peeled Rena away from Irie-san and took her out of the baseball field, she'd suddenly gone back to her normal self.`
`But we couldn't waste time, because if we did that, she'd start getting cozy with me.`
`We got on our bikes and rushed to the shrine.`
`"Man, this is really taking a while.`
` We missed out on lunch, and now this ol' man is starving."`
`"But it's good that we settled everything safely!`
` Though it may be rude to Rena-san of me to say, the past two days were far from boring!"`
`"Fun or not, we got a glimpse of how terrifying Rena really is!"`
`"Can't say I'm totally satisfied with the ending, though."`
`"...Ohhh?`
` Didn't we resolve things safely and smoothly?`
` You're being a bit odd, eh, Sis~?"`
`For some reason Mion was puffing her cheeks like she wasn't very amused.`
` ...Shion laughed at that and gave her a "there, there." ...What the heck was that about?`
`"...All right. Rena, Keiichi...`
` Once you clean your hands, you two have to pray.`
` And keep praying until I say it's okay."`
`"Got it.`
` Come on, Rena, let's get this over with and settle things!`
` If we waste time, that weird power will start affecting you again!"`
`"Y-Yeah...`
` ...Hau... Little by little, well...`
` I think I feel it coming on..."`
`"Hey, Rika-chan, this is bad! Please hurry!"`
`"...I am hurrying, so you focus your mind on prayer."`
`"A-All right... Mmmgh..."`
`"...Hey, Keiichi-kun."`
`"What?"`
`"Back there, when you... um, saved me. Thanks."`
`"Do I look like I'd abandon a friend?`
` There's no need to thank me."`
`"...Okay.`
` ...The things you said to me back then, well, I was kind of happy... Kind of."`
`"...When you said you'd rescue me.`
` That by itself... Even though my mind was all fuzzy... I heard it loud and clear.`
` ...It made me happy."`
`"I-I didn't mean anything special by it.`
` Well, uh, it just seemed like the right thing to say at the time, and I mean, it's pretty cliche!"`
`"...Keiichi-kun, you want to get the magatama out of your stomach as soon as you can, right...?"`
`"That's a dumb question.`
` I don't want to have some weird thing stuck in there forever."`
`"...R...Right.`
` ...It would bother you if, well... someone like Rena started clinging to you..."`
`"H-Hey.`
` Don't get me wrong, here...!`
` I'm not in a rush because I hate you or anything."`
`"...I mean, when the power starts up again, you'll, uh, start clinging to me, right?`
` I mean, I'm, uh, a man too, so I wouldn't hate that, but..."`
`"Your emotions being toyed with... I don't think that's fair."`
`"...Because that's not how you really feel, right?`
` That love you have is for the person you actually fall in love with. It's unfair to them if you let this weirdo mystical power direct it at me."`
`"...Yeah, you're right.`
` ...Oh, but, Keiichi-kun.`
` Back during the maid showdown, did you hear the others talk about how amazing it is that I match myself to my partner?"`
`"...Well, I guess."`
`...Ahh, so Rena was able to hear our conversation back then.`
`"This isn't just me being humble, but... everyone can put in the work to get someone they fall in love with to like them back, if they want.`
` It's not a special power Rena has."`
`"...If the person you liked said they liked homemade cookies, Rena isn't the only one who would want to do her best to make some."`
`"Mii-chan and Shii-chan and Satoko-chan and Rika-chan all would."`
`"And of course you have that power too, Keiichi-kun."`
`"Is that how it works?"`
`"I guess I can relate to liking your homemade cookies, though, Rena. I really thought they were delicious when I ate them yesterday!"`
`"Th-Thanks."`
`"...And Rena doesn't always match herself to her partner, either.`
` Sometimes, when she tries to pull them into her own world, she drags them in without thinking of the bother she's being..."`
`"Aha ha, you mean with the treasure hunting?`
` Well, at first I was pretty confused about that!`
` I was surprised when I first learned a normal girl had a hobby like that, but it ended up being a good memory for me."`
`"...Yeah, it makes sense that it confused you.`
` Because it's weird...`
` Rena shouldn't bother inviting you out for that..."`
`"If the other person doesn't seem like they'll enjoy it, it's probably better not to force them to come, yeah.`
` There are a lot of guys out there who are too soft to say anything."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...You're right."`
`"But don't get me wrong!`
` I've always thought it was fun!`
` After all, I promised that if tomorrow's club ends early, I'll go treasure hunting with you again."`
`"Y-Yeah.`
` You did.`
` Yeah..."`
`"Well, I'll stick with you until you find someone you truly want to bring on a treasure hunt.`
` So don't worry, and leave the manual labor to me! `
`But I don't think I'd be able to move a refrigerator by myself. Aha ha ha ha."`
`"Hau... Oh no...`
` Keiichi-kun... The Magatama of Fuwarazu... its power is coming up again..."`
`"Ah, crap, that's not good!`
` Just focus on praying for now!`
` Those feelings will go away in a few moments, so hold tight!"`
`"...You're right.`
` They'll disappear soon."`
`"Sheesh, I can't believe a god made such an annoying treasure!`
` He should think about the trouble he's causing."`
`"...M...Maybe.`
` ...Rena, well... I think it was a wonderful treasure..."`
`"Some people really like someone. They really love them... and need something to give them a little push.`
` ...I'm sure there have always been lots of people like that."`
`"...This magic treasure gave people like that a lot of happiness, I think."`
`"Hmm.`
` Well, you're the biggest victim of all this, so I guess I can agree."`
`"Ah... umm......... Hauu... no... no more..."`
`"Hey, Rika-chan, again?! Hurry!!"`
`"...I am hurrying. I'm going as fast as I can!"`
`"...Ke... Keiichi-kun, this... umm, it might not be how I really feel...`
` It might be the magatama's power, okay...?"`
`"W-Well, Rena Ryuugu... She really... really loves you, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...I just wanted to tell you that... since the magic is going away soon..."`
`"...St... Stupid.`
` ...Don't let that power get the better of you...`
` ...You want to be true to yourself, right?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I hope the magatama's magic... goes away soon..."`
`(Because if it doesn't, then... no matter how brave my words are... they wouldn't tell you anything...)`
`"...Meep!`
` Did you hear that, Satoko...!`
` Rena just confessed to Keiichi, meeeeep...!!"`
`"......Yeah, I heard just fine.`
` Keiichi-san and Rena-san getting along should be a good thing, but this ticks me off for some reason."`
`"Rikaaa, what if we made them bunny hop up and down the shrine stairs and told them it's part of the ritual~?"`
`"It was a good thing Mii couldn't hear that.`
` ...If she had, she'd probably drop Keiichi into a hundred-game-long losing streak of punishment games."`
`"...What if we went and told Mion-san about it right away?"`
`"That would be amusing, but I think we ought to hold on to this sort of story, just in case."`
`"It's the most deadly of magical items, an emergency escape tool for desperate situations.`
` Nipah~â™ª."`
`"...Rika, you're quite a scoundrel, aren't you...?!"`
`"Hinamizawa Village... was always a very small world.`
` ...I think they needed something wonderful to happen once in a while."`
`"...I bet that's why my ancestors continued to hold on to the Magatama of Fuwarazu."`
`"Look, I know you're trying to wrap everything up now.`
` But considering the huge number of men crying behind the backs of couples born this way, I can't be proud or happy about this."`
`"It seems a little arrogant to call yourself the god of marriage if you can't fulfill everyone's wishes, don't you think?"`
`"Meep, that's a mean way to say it!`
` There are things that can and can't be done, even for gods. `
`People out there who always rely on gods and things like that should remember that making an actual effort is an important first step. Meep."`
`"...What's this? It sounds to me like you're trying your hardest to justify a god slacking off."`
`"Oh, that's right! Rika, you still haven't received your punishment yet, have you?!"`
`"Earlier, Shion-san said she had everything all set up in the Sonozaki family's secret room, riiight?! `
`Kasai-san should have a car ready and waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs, so please look forward to what's to come!"`
`"Ahh, but of course, I will personally accompany you there~! Oh ho ho ho!"`
`"S-Satoko, you still need to receive medical treatment today, so that should be our top priority for the moment!!!"`
`"Plus, the sins of the ancestors should not be passed on to their descendants!!`
` Only by letting bygones be bygones can we pave the way to normal diplomatic relations!!"`
`"...H-Hey, Satoko, Rika-chan.`
` How long do we have to do this?"`
`"Oh, I'm sorry.`
` The ritual is over now, so it seems like you're all good now.`
` Well then, with that out of the way, it's time for Rika's trial session in the tickle torture machine!!"`
`"Heh heh heh...!`
` Rika-chama, are you ready for this...?!"`
`"M-m-m-meeeeeeep!!!"`
`Anyway, well, we had a half-baked ending, but everything worked out peacefully.`
`...Or so it seemed.`
