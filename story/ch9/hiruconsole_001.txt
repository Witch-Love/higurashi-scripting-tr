`"Ru ru, ru ta-ta, run-ta-ta~ â™ª"`
`"You're in a good mood. You found a new pile of trash at the dam site, didn't you?"`
`"Yep, that's right~!`
` I wonder what's buried in the new pile!`
` I predict I'll find a kyute little treasure~!`
` After I get home, I'm going straight there for treasure-hunting!`
` Keiichi-kun, wanna come too? Wanna come?"`
`"Who, me?`
` Hmm... I still haven't finished all the comics Mion lent me."`
`"Uu~ A girl invites you out, but you'd rather read comics... Hau.`
` ...This is what I get for helping a friend in need during club today, huh..."`
`"N-N-No, I'm sorry, I lied! I'm all for treasure hunting!`
` Please, allow this one to accompany you on your journey, Rena-san!!"`
`...Club activities today could be summed up as "heartless." Every man for himself! Anyone showing weakness was crushed and dropped into last place.`
`I would gladly romp people at an advantage, and be romped when the roles were reversed.`
`But today, luck just wasn't in my favor, and the deciding match completely backfired on me.`
`...That was when Rena had given me a little help.`
`"But you ended up in last anyway.`
` Ahahaha, the punishment game is this Sunday, and I can't wait! Can't wait!"`
`"...Uuuu, you helped me so much, and now look at me...`
` I'm worthless..."`
`In the end, I couldn't put Rena's help to good use, and that locked me in last place.`
`...But it was definitely thanks to her that I could even try going for that big, deciding match to turn things around.`
`If she hadn't helped me out, I would have lost even worse, without even having that opportunity.`
`Rena didn't have any responsibility to try and rescue me. Normally, you'd decide that if you couldn't hope for first, you could at least avoid last.`
`If she left me alone, it would have assured my last-place finish. She wouldn't gain anything from saving me aside from risk to herself, would she?`
`And yet she'd helped me anyway.`
`...That fragment of kindness in the world of our cold, heartless club was sublime, as though the Buddha's nimbus had reached me in hell.`
`The one rule of our club was to fight without pity or mercy.`
`But even amidst that... Rena was the one who always held onto her kindness. She wants everyone to have a good time playing games.`
`"Ahahahaha, you think too highly of me.`
` ...Rena just hates one-sided games.`
` I mean, anyone would get sulky if they knew they couldn't make a comeback no matter how hard they fought."`
`"W-Well, I guess.`
` ...After all, once I was locked in for the punishment game, they started taking my clothing measurements without waiting for the end...`
` Ah, crap, what the heck did they need them for...? Sob..."`
`"I think you can always make a comeback, no matter how bad it gets.`
` ...Or, more like, that's how the world should be.`
` That's why Rena can't help but give a chance to people who are up a creek without a paddle."`
`"......Rena, you're such a nice person.`
` ...When you were weak, I knocked you out without mercy, so hearing this pricks my conscience... Uuu!"`
`"Ahahaha, Rena does it because she wants to. I'm not telling you to do it too.`
` But, well, when Rena is in a pinch... She'd be really happy if you repaid the favor! She would be!"`
`"Right!`
` I owe you one for today!`
` Well, aside from that.`
` I'll go treasure hunting with you once in a while.`
` Let's meet up at the dam site?"`
`"Okay!`
` Let's meet at the treasure mountain!!"`
`After answering with a wide smile, Rena ran off, waving her arm...`
