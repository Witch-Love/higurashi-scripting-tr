`*craaaack*`
`"R-ridiculous...?!"`
`This time, Kameda-kun fell to his knees and collapsed right there on the mound.`
`Rena's third hit of the day arched toward center field and then disappeared.`
`"K-Keiichi-san...?"`
`"No need to worry!`
` I'll show you my true poweeer!"`
`Then, I stepped into the batter's box and tightened my grip with all my might as I set the bat into position.`
`"Come on, hit me with whatever you've gooot!!!"`
`"I told you so~~!!`
` How could you strike out seven times in a row after running your mouth like that~~!?!"`
`"I-I'm sorr... Gah?!"`
`"I-it wasn't supposed to be like... Aaah?!"`
`"C-come on, I'm trying to talk h... Bwuh?!"`
`"...Consider this your punishment.`
` Any fool who betrays our expectations deserves a thorough reprimand~!!"`
`"Gwuh! Gah! Ergh! Agh!!"`
`Going up against Rena when she was going all out, without even a plan, I suffered a crushing one-sided defeat.`
`And then, the club members dished out their punishment for me, which they called "octo thwacking."`
`"Come on... this is like the rough blessing players give a batter who hits a game-winning home run, y'know?"`
`"...Just think of this as the opposite of that, with 'rage' and 'loathing' mixed in."`
`"Then again, aren't these some weird weapons added to the mix?"`
`...At any rate, Satoko and Rika were able to persuade Coach afterwards with their "Weaponized Crying Strategy", and we were able to free Rena from the magatama's curse.`
`However, one of the conditions of the exchange was "Satoko and Rika-chan serve me dressed as maids", so the two people who took the most direct damage from this mess were especially bitter and resentful, and wanted to take it out on me...`
`...Oww! Ow, ow, owwww?!`
`"Well, I suppose for now that settles things... We good?"`
`"N-no, I am not good at all!`
` S-somebody, help meee~~!!`
` Renaaa~~!!"`
`"...Hau?`
` Keiichi-kun, did you do something wrong? Wrong?"`
