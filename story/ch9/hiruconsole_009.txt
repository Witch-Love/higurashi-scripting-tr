`After nightfall, right as we were about to eat dinner, a phone call came in.`
`Mom, who had just finished making preparations, rushed over toward the front door.`
`"Huh?`
` I wonder who it is.`
` Could it be about Rena?!"`
`Just as I predicted, it was a call from Rena's father.`
`"H-Hello?`
` Yes, good evening!"`
`"I apologize for calling this late.`
` Is Reina there?`
` She ran out of the house earlier this evening and hasn't come back."`
`"She ran out of the house?`
` Umm, how was she?"`
`"Well, she was in a headlong kind of run, like when she's playing a prank on someone.`
` I'd thought she was going to one of her friend's houses..."`
`"...That settles it.`
` Somebody picked up the white magatama!!"`
`"I'm very sorry for being late!!"`
`"...What's the situation?"`
`"We just got permission to go into Rena's room.`
` Judging by how she was acting at school, she must have left some clues in there."`
`"Yeah.`
` Come to think of it, I've never been in Rena's room before.`
` ...Makes me kind of nervous!"`
`"""Oh, wow..."""`
`"I had a feeling, but... This room is really something.`
` I can't tell whether it's a collection of trinkets or just a mess of junk!"`
`"...And yet she knows exactly where to find each and every one of her treasures."`
`"It's just as terrific as she is.`
` How did she fit all these things in here?`
` She must have been a dog in her past life!`
` I bet she liked collecting a lot of shoes and stuff."`
`"I always thought girl's rooms would be like... more tidy, more cute and bright and girly...`
` Maybe that's just a misconception that guys have. `
`I mean, Rena's room is like this, and Mion's room has comics laying around everywhere."`
`"Ahahahaha, well, this old man isn't a little girl, after all~"`
`"...Huh?`
` I think that was just Sis's manga room.`
` Kei-chan, have you ever been in Sis's actual room?`
` Not in the main building, the one farther awayâ€” mmff!!"`
`"Sh-Shion!!`
` Shhhh!! Shhhh!!!"`
`"Ah, would you look at this!!`
` Look at all the books over here!!"`
`Satoko pointed over at Rena's desk. A big pile of books, some open, sat on top of it.`
`"What kind of books is it this time?!`
` Hmm~?`
` Hardcover books of some sort?`
` Did she borrow these from the library? `
`Let's see... 'Modern Maid Theory,' 'The Way of the Maid is not Walked in a Day,' 'What is Beautiful Service.'`
` ...What the? They're all books about maids?"`
`...Hmm?`
`""Wh-what the heeeeck?!""`
