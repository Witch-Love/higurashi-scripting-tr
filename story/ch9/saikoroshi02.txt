`I'd hoped Satoko would be there when I woke up that morning.`
`I'd hoped this baffling world was just a half-awake dream of mine.`
`So when I awoke, not to a familiar ceiling, but to the one in the Furude main house... I could feel nothing but disappointment.`
`My mind hazy, I recalled the situation I'd been put into...`
`Thanks to my own carelessness, I'd gotten lost in this strange world.`
`Hanyuu's power couldn't reach here, so it would be incredibly difficult to escape.`
`...It was like trying to climb up the spider's thread to paradise.`
`But the spider's thread was still there.`
`No matter how thin it was... its presence meant there was still a chance.`
`To discover what was blocking Hanyuu's power.`
`...And I didn't even know what it looked like.`
`The only possible clue was that Hanyuu was the deity of Hinamizawa, so it was probably in the village somewhere.`
`I picked up the crystal ball, which I'd snuck out of the ritual implement storehouse.`
`...The ball gave off a weak and somehow unnatural light.`
`I pressed it to my forehead... and I could sense a faint presence that only I, as a witch, could feel.`
`I was sure that whatever I needed to find, I would get the same feeling from it as this.`
`But again, like the crystal ball, I'd probably have to hold it to my forehead to sense anything.`
`...It didn't seem like things would be as simple as wandering about until I felt something.`
`But, if it was related to Hanyuu's power like the crystal ball was, it was almost certainly in that storehouse.`
`Unfortunately, the storehouse was a complete mess of everything from ancient torture devices, to piles of old documents, to mountains of trash I didn't even know how to use.`
`The only place with any semblance of cleanliness was the space around the vessel and the altar.`
`Finding anything, especially an object as small as this crystal ball, would be no simple matter.`
`"Rika!`
` Eat your breakfast and hurry on to school!"`
`I heard my mother's voice from the kitchen.`
`...The school in this world wasn't the one I went to.`
`If I had the time to go somewhere I didn't belong, then I should be using it to search the storehouse.`
`But there was no proof my search would only take one or two days.`
`...I really hated to say it...`
` but since I didn't even know what it looked like...`
` maybe I needed to prepare myself for the search to take years.`
`If I didn't go to school, Chie, ever-conscientious, would call the house to see if I was staying home that day.`
`...If that happened, it would cause trouble with both the school and my parents.`
` I couldn't imagine how much time this search would take.`
`If my parents grew suspicious, things would get harder.`
` ...Slow and steady wins the race, I guess.`
`...Although it was frustrating, for weekdays, it would be better to pretend I was going to school like normal.`
`I let out a languid sigh, got up, and decided to eat breakfast.`
`During mealtime, my mother's ramblings about how I was never allowed to go into the ritual storehouse again steadily made the food taste worse.`
`...My mother was always insistent and long-winded.`
` I hated this part of her.`
`The elders in the village laughed and said she couldn't help it, since she did it for her only beloved daughter, but to me, she was just a nuisance.`
`Tough love wasn't what I needed at the moment.`
`The only thing I could be thankful for was, maybe, that I didn't have to make breakfast for myself.`
`......But I could do it on my own, so I almost would have rather she left it to me.`
`After I was done eating and started getting ready for school, my mother continued to nag me about making it on time.`
`Ahh, how aggravating...`
`Maybe going to school wasn't so bad—I wouldn't have to see my mother's face for half a day.`
`I thanked her for the food, cleaned my plate and utensils in the sink, and left immediately for school.`
`If everything was going to betray my expectations anyway, I wish class would too.`
`...But even in this world, class went the exact same way as the world I knew.`
`I thought I'd escaped that world, and now it was repeating.`
` ...Thinking that way made me feel even more listless.`
`Normally I'd distract myself by teasing Satoko, but her seat was far away from mine.`
`She was probably also so bored with class she didn't know what to do with herself.`
`Satoshi, earnestly studying in the next seat over, was constantly trying to get her to focus.`
`Mion seemed to be butting into Reina's business, too.`
`But they weren't fooling around. It was a strange, though pleasant, sight—they were helping one another learn.`
`Actually, they weren't the only pleasant sight; everyone in the classroom was like that.`
`I felt like I was the only one left out.`
`I didn't know whether my seat was in its own row because of the odd number of students...`
` or if I'd chosen this seat on purpose in this world... but it felt like my seat was separated from the rest of the classroom.`
`When lunchtime came, I felt even more alienated.`
`My classmates formed groups with friends and took out their food.`
`The club members who would always eat with me weren't here.`
`...Satoko was part of a circle of several friends, including her brother.`
`There was no place for me to wedge myself into.`
`Mion and Reina were sitting face-to-face as they ate.`
` ...No room for me there, either.`
`And nobody asked me if I wanted to eat with them.`
`And they had fun eating their own meals, so this seemed natural, like it was something that happened every day.`
`For a short while, I waited, hoping for Satoko or Mion or Reina to invite me over.`
` ...After the clock's minute hand moved five, and then ten places, I realized I might even be left behind in eating... `
`and finally gave up and opened up my bento box.`
`Inside were the leftovers of last night's burned hamburg steak and white rice with nori seaweed that was now sticky.`
` Spinach wrapped with gooey nori. `
`And the remains of kinpira with chopped burdock root, also burned.`
`...I guess I'd forgotten about that.`
` For some reason, my mother overcooked everything.`
`"Summer is dangerous if you don't let the heat in" was a favorite phrase of hers; she would cook steaks until they were rock-hard, and even when she made fish, she'd turn half their insides to ash.`
`Even Satoko was better than that—at least she knew how hot to cook things.`
`...Ahh, and when I learned how to cook from Hanyuu and started to make things better than my mother, she must not have been happy.`
`It tasted terrible, too.`
` No presentation, either.`
`......If Mion decided to have a bento contest and I only had this, I'd end up in last place.`
` But... there was no club in this world, so I didn't have to worry about that...`
`Satoko's happy laughter not being directed at me... made me feel sad.`
`...Suddenly, our eyes met.`
`Did my feelings... get through...?`
`Satoko burst out of her seat and glared at me.`
`"...What are you staring at?`
` If you have something to say, say it!"`
`"I... I don't have anything to say."`
`"Stop it, Satoko.`
` You just happened to look at each other, didn't you?"`
`"It didn't 'just happen'!`
` She was staring at me this whole time!`
` It was getting gross, come on!"`
`Satoko and her friends began whispering amongst themselves while looking at me.`
`I couldn't hear what they said, but I could easily imagine them enjoying themselves...`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` I won't stare at you."`
`"I hope not!`
` You were making my cream croquettes taste worse!"`
`"......"`
`I angled my desk a little so that I couldn't see Satoko and the others.`
`...At first, I had called this world's Satoko 'cold', but it looked like I was mistaken.`
`This world's Satoko either didn't like me... or outright hated me.`
`And the other kids close to my age seemed to have formed a community around her...`
` with no place for me in it...`
` so they all hated me too.`
`The hardened, ash-like steak tasted of salt...`
`Why... did I have to feel this sad and lonely when I ate...`
`In all of the other worlds... all the club members would be enjoying lunch together.`
`Satoko would be there, and Rena, and Mion and Keiichi... Everyone would be having fun... and spending their break cheerfully and noisily...`
`That was when Reina came over and peered into my bento box.`
`"Rika-chan, you have steak and spinach for lunch today?`
` That looks good."`
`"..............."`
`It was clear that Reina had come over to try and comfort my distress... and for some reason, that was frustrating, so I didn't want to answer her.`
`When I stayed silent, she held out an octopus-shaped sausage in front of me.`
`"I'll trade your spinach for my octopus.`
` Okay?"`
`"........."`
`Reina, trying to be nice as I ate lunch alone, hated by my classmates... I just couldn't accept it.`
`I suddenly said I was going to wash my hands, then left... and in a bathroom stall, I covered my face with toilet paper and cried.`
`...The tears soaked through the paper and crinkled it up, but I didn't care...`
`...This was fine.`
` It was better if I didn't have friends in this world.`
`I had plenty of friends in the one I needed to return to.`
`There, even Satoko was my irreplaceable best friend... and all the club members, who would never leave me alone during lunch hour, were waiting for me.`
`...Why would I be sad that some Satoko I didn't know was being mean to me in a world I didn't care about?`
` Why would I be...`
`But... despite the lies I told myself, I couldn't stop crying for a while...`
`...I decided to steel my resolve and wait for school to end.`
`Then I'd run back home, say I was going out to play, and sneak into the ritual implement storehouse again.`
`...That was the only way I could get back to my original world.`
` I had to try and do my best for that purpose alone.`
`......Okay.`
`I looked into the mirror in the bathroom to see a face red from crying.`
`...If Chie saw me like this, things would probably get even more complicated.`
`I washed my face, then spent the rest of lunch break quietly in a corner of the classroom.`
`After school, I literally dashed out of the building.`
`It would be a huge pain if I ended up caught in the rush of the other classmates as they headed out to go play.`
`I think Satoshi called after me, but I ignored him.`
`...He was probably just trying to apologize for his sister about what happened during lunch.`
` I didn't care about that.`
`I didn't want to stay in this horrible world a second more than I needed to.`
`I ran full speed back to the house, ignored my mother when she asked, as usual, if I had any homework, and searched for a lantern.`
`Then I told her I was going out to play, and without waiting for a response, burst out of the house.`
`Then I went around the shrine and looked for my father.`
`I saw a note hanging on the assembly hall that said there was a shrine association meeting.`
` ...I could hear my father's voice amidst the lighthearted chatter.`
`...It was the same opportunity I had yesterday.`
`Today, I'd have to be careful not to let on that I was inside.`
`After making sure nobody was looking, I climbed up the tree I'd gotten the hang of yesterday.`
`I had been scared of the height before, but I wasn't afraid any longer, probably because I'd cried my eyes out and resolved myself during lunch.`
`...What I really had to be afraid of wasn't heights, or my parents, or the coldhearted Satoko.`
` ...It was not being able to return to my original world.`
`The next scariest thing... would be losing contact with Hanyuu, I think.`
`In the darkness of the storehouse, I took the crystal ball out of my pocket.`
`...Its weak glow seemed a little more energetic than yesterday.`
`Maybe if she rested, a little of her power would come back.`
`Nevertheless, it was still weak.`
` ...If I wasted it on fruitless conversation, the light might go out entirely.`
`I firmly squashed down the desire to check and make sure I could still call her and turned on the lantern.`
` ...It was time to go treasure hunting.`
`Was there anything around, anything only I could feel?`
` ...Something that felt the same as this crystal ball... Somewhere...`
`I closed my eyes, honed my senses, and hoped.`
`...But all I heard were the cries of cicadas.`
` I hadn't expected anything else—it looked like this would be a tough nut to crack.`
`"...Too optimistic.`
` ...Phew......"`
`Searching the entire storehouse... How much time would that take?`
` ...I didn't want to imagine it.`
`......But I had to do it, or I couldn't go home.`
`...I'd do it systematically.`
` Start in the corner, and go in order.`
`Without knowing what it looked like, I'd start in the corner and go from there, not even letting water past.`
`And despite all that, I had no proof it was even in here.`
`......I felt like it would be easier to just fight Takano and the Mountain Dogs again...`
`"...I don't think it's going to get any weaker.`
` I can hear your voice about as loudly as I could before."`
`"Which means, like always, it'll only get to you weakly.`
` ...I guess there was no need for us to chat."`
`"...No, I think chatting is exactly what you need to do right now, Rika."`
`".........Maybe.`
` Thanks.`
` ......I'll talk now.`
` ...I'm pretty sure I searched the storehouse as well as I could.`
` ......But I have nothing. `
`...I searched for about a week, but I don't even know what the thing I'm searching for looks like.`
` ...And even if I did find it, I might have put it down again without realizing."`
`"...Au au."`
`"Honestly... this is really hard.`
` ......If only I knew what it looked like...`
` Or had some proof it was in this storehouse.`
` ......Being locked in here for so long is going to make me go crazy."`
`"I understand.`
` I know it's a very difficult search...`
` ...I'm doing my best, too, to see if I can at least find out what the Fragment looks like."`
`"And?`
` Did you find anything out?"`
`"...Rika, in your world, Fragments are interpreted as 'feelings.'`
` When those feelings reside in something, they become Fragments."`
`"I understand the logic...`
` but that doesn't give me much of a hint."`
`"...Au.`
` ...And as for how to return the Fragment to this world... I think that it needs to lose its form in that world."`
`"What does that mean?`
` Do I have to break it?"`
`"Yes, and completely.`
` If it's lost from the human world, you can send it to the world of the gods."`
`"...Do you know about the law of conservation of matter?`
` It's impossible to destroy something completely."`
`"Well, that's why I'm saying you only need to destroy its form.`
` Understand, Rika?`
` Even in ancient times, people used methods like this to send things to the gods."`
`".........I see. All right."`
`A way ancients sent tributes to the gods. A way to get rid of something from the human world...`
`"You're telling me to burn it.`
` Burn it into ash, and send it into the sky."`
`"That's right.`
` By burning something to ashes, it loses its form, loses its meaning, and vanishes from the human world."`
`"...I see.`
` So I need to burn whatever is housing the Fragment.`
` ...I pray that it's easy to set on fire.`
` If it was a boulder, I'd have to throw it into a blast furnace or something..."`
`"......Actually, Rika...`
` The Fragment might not only be in an object...`
` It's possible it could be in a person, too."`
`"I see—because the Fragments are 'feelings'.`
` They might not only reside in objects.`
` ...But Hanyuu, if it was a person, what would I do?`
` You're not telling me to burn them to ash, I'm sure."`
`"......The meaning of a human disappears the moment they lose their life."`
`"That would make sense.`
` Corpses aren't people anymore.`
` ......So if the Fragment is residing in a person..."`
`"...............Au au."`
`......I'd believed until now I'd been searching for an object, but maybe it doesn't even have to be that.`
`I'd have no problem burning an object.`
`...But if... it wasn't an object, but a "person"...`
`"............I don't like this.`
` ......This world...`
` For some reason, only the bad ideas turn out to be true."`
`"...I can only pray it doesn't turn out like that."`
`"If only bad ideas turn out to be true,`
` then I could take advantage of that... and search there first.`
` ...If it was a person, they'd be closely connected to Oyashiro-sama, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Most likely..."`
`"...Is it possible it's me?"`
`"No, it isn't.`
` If you were the Fragment rejecting me, you wouldn't be able to talk to me right now."`
`"...Which means......`
` next is my father, head priest of the Furude Shrine...`
` and my mother, carrier of the Furude lineage.`
` ......If it was one of them, I'd just have to kill them, right?"`
`"......Ah... au au au..."`
`My human morality refused the idea of killing my parents.`
`...But that was nothing a world-crossing witch needed to think about.`
`For someone with a true world somewhere else, this was a false world.`
` ...Meaning it was the same as a dream.`
`Murdering someone in a dream was no different from doing it in a delusion or daydream.`
`There was nothing to consider about committing the sin in this world...`
`Hanyuu was making sad "au au" noises, so I told her how I felt.`
`"...Stop being such a hypocrite.`
` ...Would you rather give up on returning to our original world?"`
`"...Ah... au au au..."`
`"You're a coward.`
` You're going to force me to dirty my hands, while never dirtying yours.`
` ...Convenient, isn't it? If you can blame it all on one person, nobody else will be marked with sin. `
`I'm the perfect human sacrifice."`
`"..........................."`
`I felt those words were a little harsh on Hanyuu.`
`For a short while, she remained silent, not saying anything.`
` ...But her breathing made it sound like she wanted to say something, but was hesitating.`
`"...I... want to go back to the final world.`
` ......Rena said this once.`
` 'I wonder how much we're allowed to struggle in order to be happy...'`
` I didn't think there was a limit to that effort."`
`But Keiichi changed that.`
`There's no limit to effort.`
`...But you have to talk to a lot of people to get their advice on whether your efforts are misplaced or not.`
`That's why I was talking about it with Hanyuu, the only one who shared my current situation.`
`......And Hanyuu said that if the object possessing the Fragment was a person, I had to kill them.`
`...I would want to avoid that, of course, if there were any other way.`
`But if she said that was the only way......`
` then I wouldn't hesitate.`
` That was all.`
`".........I...`
` I want to go back too..."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Me too."`
`"I'll be praying... that the Fragment... isn't held by a person."`
`"Please, do.`
` ...I will too.`
` ......And I apologize.`
` I was too hard on you.`
` ...All you can do is look for clues and keep my spirits up so I don't get discouraged. `
`...I didn't understand how annoying it must be not to be able to look for the key yourself."`
`"......It isn't as hard as it is for you, Rika.`
` ...The only thing I can do... is at least be here to care for you, so that your heart doesn't tire out..."`
`"...Thanks.`
` These idle chats with you are the most enjoyable thing about this world.`
` It's like I wake up from the nightmare for a few minutes."`
`"......Au au..."`
`...I see.`
` I sort of understood why she said chatting could be important.`
`Hanyuu was the only one I could talk to from my original world.`
`If I lose contact with Hanyuu... maybe my very connection to that world would weaken, and my memories would blur.`
`And that... would simply give birth to a miserable, broken-hearted girl, living a delusion that this world wasn't the one she belonged in.`
`"...Leave it to me.`
` I swear we'll go back there together.`
` ...You keep looking around for any clues you can find.`
` ...If there are any developments on my end, I'll contact you again."`
`"......I understand.`
` ......Rika, hold it together.`
` ......Go for it, yay. Remember?"`
`"...Yay."`
`I couldn't hear Hanyuu anymore.`
`The crystal ball's light had grown weaker than ever.`
`...But as long as it had its otherworldly glow... then I could keep believing this wasn't the world I was supposed to live in.`
`Before, I might have shed a tear or two by now.`
` But all the tears I could cry had dried up.`
`I gripped the crystal ball tightly, savoring the cheer Hanyuu had given me.`
`......Do your best.`
` ...Go for it, yay...`
`...I moved over to a spot with a pile of old documents.`
`If it could interfere with Hanyuu, it had to be related to the legends of Oyashiro-sama.`
`...So maybe, I thought, a clue would be written in one of the documents in that pile.`
`Maybe even if the thing I searched for wasn't in here, I could find a clue to it instead.`
`I took a few documents from the pile and packed them into the knapsack I brought with me.`
`I could read some, but couldn't understand any of the others.`
`...If something important was in one of the indecipherable ones, I would have no way of knowing.`
` But I shouldn't think about that right now.`
`I pulled out the few documents I could read and decided to read them in secret at school and in bed.`
`As I went in and out of the storehouse, the chances of my parents finding out increased.`
`...In that sense, this would lower that risk, which made it a little easier for me.`
`......Maybe parents did understand their children best, and would be the first ones to help them...`
` but that was when they were normal, and not a witch like me.`
`If their daughter started babbling about not being from this world, they'd probably tie her down and summon a noisy ambulance.`
`...If I were a little more cunning, I could flatter my parents and put the work in to make this world a little more bearable.`
`But the more I thought about this world not being the one I lived in, the more apathetic I felt towards interacting with those who were here.`
`That was probably why it seemed like I was being more and more isolated in class.`
`...Of course, maybe you could say that was my own fault.`
` That was the kind of world this was at the moment "I" arrived; I won't dare let anyone say that this is my fault.`
`Of course, not a single person could tell the difference between Rika Furude and "me" anyway.`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` Who...`
` is "me"?`
`The "me" that isn't Rika Furude... Who is she?`
`I came around to a quiet, electronic beep.`
`I looked at my watch and noticed it was already evening.`
`Being in here made me lose track of time.`
`The other day I was out way past curfew, and was scolded for a long time; the alarm on my watch was to prevent that.`
`...Letting my relationship with my parents grow any worse would make everything else more troublesome.`
` ...I should call it quits for today.`
`With practiced motions, I climbed the bundle of chains and headed through the exit in the roof.`
`When I returned to the main house, surrounded by the cries of higurashi that I'd grown completely tired of,`
` there was a tightly packed case of beer near the front door...`
` and three bottles of wine.`
`The beer case was probably for a drinking party at the shrine's assembly hall or something.`
`...My father didn't drink beer because he liked it, so I knew it had to be for the assembly hall.`
`They delivered it here before the party so he could chill it beforehand in the assembly hall refrigerator.`
`And... The wine probably belonged to my father.`
` My father enjoys Western spirits, and wine most of all.`
`...And wine, at the same time, was something I enjoyed as well.`
`Before, after my parents had died in 1981, I'd gotten wine by bringing it from the main house, but my parents were alive in this world, so I couldn't do that.`
`I stared at the bottles longingly as I tried to open the door, receiving the clack of its lock in response.`
`I took a key from my pocket, unlocked the door, went in, and saw a note addressed to me right upon entering.`
`It was from my mother.`
`The note said an accident had suddenly occurred at the Kimiyoshi house, and they'd gone out to help with a memorial service.`
` They'd be late coming back, and so on and so forth.`
`Written as a postscript was a notice that the brewer would be bringing alcohol, and to take it inside the front door once I got back for them.`
`...I see. That must have been referring to all of this.`
`If the person had come while I was here, I could have told them to put it inside... but I couldn't bear to see them outside like this, put here before I got back.`
`And it would be a pain if my mother started rambling about me being inconsiderate later.`
`...I made a sour face, not caring who saw, and pulled the case of beer through the front door.`
`...Next, I stood before the wine bottles... and solidified my thoughts.`
`Couldn't there have been a slip-up with the order?`
`......It was a brewery in a small village.`
` If my father called to say he'd ordered one more bottle, they'd probably bring over another one without a second thought. `
`...So what would it matter if one of these disappeared......?`
`I always dilute it before drinking, so I'd be able to enjoy one bottle of wine for a pretty long time.`
`Despite being in the entrance, I belatedly looked around, grabbed a bottle, ran into my room, and then pushed it into the winter futon in my closet that I wouldn't use for a while.`
`Actually... My parents live here too, so I won't have many chances to drink...`
`I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a glass, ice, a corkscrew... and a carton of orange juice, then ran back into my room.`
`...I put the corkscrew on the wine bottle, and was overwhelmed by the urge to wet my tongue with the nostalgic flavor as soon as I could.`
`How was I supposed to survive in this world without enjoying a good wine?`
`I poured some into the glass, and just listening to the orange juice splashing in to fill it up made my mouth water like a dog.`
`...If I dilute it this much, it'll look just like orange juice from the outside.`
`But...... it was the nostalgic flavor that belonged to my world.`
`At one time, this had been the flavor of my tears of defeat, shed for the unbreakable June of 1983.`
`...But now, even those tears of defeat felt sweet and tender...`
`Those dead-end worlds were very painful.`
`But I was still... surrounded by my kind friends.`
`I had the leeway to choose to surrender to Takano and continue lazily living in that infinite loop.`
`...But even that warmth was absent in this world.`
`......This made a week now, since I came here.`
`With no prospects of returning to my previous world, I'd resolved myself to staying here for a long time—but a week in, it had already driven me to drink.`
`It'll be fine...`
` Those worlds had driven me to the same state.`
` ...And I still managed, lazily doing my best as I soaked in wine, right?`
`...I needed to be released from this Rika Furude quickly.`
`Nobody in this world would understand that, even if I explained it.`
` That meant I had no allies here.`
`If I told someone... they'd think I'd gone crazy.`
`But considering this world's Rika Furude, that was only natural.`
`...This world's Rika Furude was a dour girl without a single friend.`
`And one day, she'd been hit by a ball in the schoolyard, and started saying she didn't belong in this world.`
`...If that big doctor, Yamamoto, heard about this, he'd probably make a huge fuss about the impact having caused brain damage.`
`But... that would make the most sense to the people who live here.`
`At the very least, until "I" arrived, Rika Furude was Rika Furude, the correct being for this world.`
`Maybe it was more appropriate to say that one day, "I," someone different from this world's Rika, appeared, then took over Rika's body.`
`.........Right.`
` ...Am I...`
` not...`
` Rika Furude?`
`Well, no.`
` This world's Rika Furude was this world's Rika Furude, a different being than me.`
` I'd simply been interpreting her as being the same as me, even when I was in different worlds—until now.`
`...When I thought about that... leaving aside whether I'd been living happily......`
` I felt like I'd done something bad to this world's Rika Furude.`
`Of course, it was too late to apologize now, and I couldn't give this body back to her anymore.`
`...If there was a way to apologize, it would be to acknowledge this world's Rika Furude as a being of her own.`
`Because if I called myself Rika Furude, the girl who already existed would vanish from this life...`
`Which meant the only way to apologize was...`
` to not call myself...`
` Rika Furude.`
`...Well, that had been bothering me for a long time.`
`I've long felt that my young self, pampered as the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, and my old self, who had awakened and traveled countless worlds, had different personalities.`
`But if I thought of them not as personalities, but as different beings entirely...`
`Right now, I was...`
` no longer Rika Furude.`
`I...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` Who am I?`
`I stared vacantly at the wine bottle.`
`Did I like this brand?`
` My father always loved to drink this wine.`
`...As a result, I'd borrowed it in countless worlds, and I loved to drink it even now.`
`Right now, I couldn't even be lazy without borrowing the power of alcohol, and this wine comforted me, just a little.`
`...At this point, I couldn't go on living without this wine.`
`So, in other words, I wasn't alive, but the wine was...`
`Which meant I wasn't Rika Furude... and that I was the wine...`
`...I stared at the Western letters of the brand name written on the wine label, which I didn't know how to pronounce...`
` and thought to myself that it was the name of "me."`
`My name is Rika Furude...`
` no, not that... but this "Bernkastel."`
` ...I don't know what that means.`
` Maybe I'll ask my father.`
`Frederica Bernkastel.`
` ...Ah, whatever. What a silly name that is.`
` Aha ha ha.`
`...My thoughts began to slur and muddle.`
`Cheers... to this shithole of a world.`
