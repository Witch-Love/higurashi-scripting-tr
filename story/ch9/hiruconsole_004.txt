`"...It's already really dark out."`
`"Rikaaa, can't we handle this tomorrow?`
` If any of the adults in the village see us, they'll tell us it's unsafe for kids to be playing at this hour and force us to go home."`
`"...Well, they probably won't scold me for it though, as long as I'm together with you."`
`"Meep... We can't.`
` I've got a really bad feeling about what might happen if we don't find it quick."`
`"...Meep!`
` I can feel energy waves from the sealed treasure...`
` It has to be around here somewhere.`
` Meep, meep, meep..."`
`"Uhh, Rika, that's a... ghost energy radar you brought with you?`
` Sure would be helpful if that thing was a little more precise though.`
` It looks about as weird as you'd expect for something like that."`
`In fact, no matter how you look at it, it just looks like a directional magnet...`
`"Anyway, we've been coming and going all over the village. I'm tired.`
` We're making Shion-san worry... *yaaaaawn*`
` Mmmmmm, isn't it about time to get some sleeeep...?"`
`"Meep... You're only able to be so carefree because you don't know the terrible power of the Magatama of Fuwarazu.`
` If you knew how frightening it was, you'd understand why I'm in such a panic about it..."`
`"They're mystical jewels that bind people in love, right?`
` If you give one of the pair of red and white magatama to your sweetheart, your love will be reciprocated.`
` Isn't that wonderful?"`
`"...That's exactly why it's dangerous!`
` The young people around here would probably have a big, bloody war over them!! `
`One story from the ancient texts says that a group of men started killing each other over a single maiden!"`
`"...If you feel that strongly about it, I guess. Though it seems like that energy would be better spent on a different endeavor.`
` But I guess you're rightâ€”they shouldn't be lying by the roadside."`
`"Oh, right!`
` Rika, since we're going through all this effort, would it be so bad to have a little bit of fun with these things before returning them to the heavens?`
` Oh ho ho ho!`
` *yaaawn*"`
`"That would probably be okay, but we still need to find them first."`
`"Meep? ...We're getting closer, we're getting closer...!`
` Meep... me-me-me-me-me-meeeeep!!"`
`Satoko turned toward something glimmering on the dark night road.`
`It looked almost like luminous paint, and for a few moments, the light shone weakly...`
`"Is that it?!"`
`I pointed my flashlight at it and saw a small, open box on its side.`
`Though small, it had an intricate design, convincing me it would make sense if it held the Furude Shrine's treasure.`
`But the outside didn't matter. What mattered was the inside.`
`"Ah!`
` ...Meep."`
`"...It's empty.`
` I see. The two magatama, one red and one white, would sit in these dents."`
`On the inside, it was made like a jewel box, empty save for the two depressions the Magatama probably fit into.`
`"Meep, it might be lying around nearby.`
` Let's search a little more for it!"`
`"Rika, why don't you use your ghost radar to find it?`
` There's no way we'd be able to find such a little jewel in the dark."`
`"Well... meep.`
` I think my ghost energy transmitter is stuck on the box instead...`
` If they're not in the box, I can't search for them... Meep."`
`According to Rika, a stronger radar would apparently be able to detect the magatama themselves.`
`But that one was tucked away deep in the recesses of the ritual storehouse and would've been troublesome to retrieve, so they left it behind. ...What a waste.`
`Although, a 'transmitter' and ancient treasure finding 'radar' sound like weird objects. But no matter how you look at it, it seems like a directional magnet.`
`The two of them swung their flashlights about, but even if it had been daytime, it was hard to believe they'd be able to find anything in all the gravel and weeds.`
`What's worse, the magatama were probably only the size of candies, judging by the size of the depressions in the box.`
`"They probably flew out when the box fell out of the sky and hit the ground."`
`"...And it had to be right next to the trash piles?`
` The day it falls down this slope and into that mess... it'll be over.`
` We'll never find it."`
`"...Meep."`
`...Just then, an idea flashed through Rika's mind.`
`...That may be the case for normal people, but... what about Rena, lord of the trash piles?`
`The red and white jewels were called 'magatamas', but the pictures of them in the scroll looked more like key rings with seals on them. To be frank, Rena's fingers would be just itching for these.`
`After explaining as much to Satoko, she nodded in agreement.`
`"Come to think of it... Rena-san said she was going to stop by the landfill, didn't she?`
` There was a new trash pile, so I think she wanted to go treasure hunting."`
`"Could Rena have picked them up...?"`
`"I don't know for sure.`
` Why don't we ask her at school tomorrow?`
` Calling her this late would be quite rude."`
`"...Meep..."`
`"Rika, let's call it quits for today.`
` If it gets any darker, it won't be safe to walk the streets.`
` And if we read the scroll a little more closely, maybe we'll be able to find a hint, right?"`
`"...It can't be helped."`
`Good grief. This is one troublesome magic item that made its way into Hinamizawa...`
`...Wait, could there really be a treasure with an effect like that?`
`Despite how serious Rika was about it, Satoko herself hadn't seen it with her own eyes, so she was still skeptical...`
`"Ahh, seriously!`
` Good grief~..."`
