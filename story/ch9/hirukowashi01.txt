`"Treasure hunting!!`
` There's two fun things about it.`
` One is obviously finding kyute treasures, but do you know the other?!"`
`"...Getting all sweaty, not finding anything, realizing how precious our lives and time are, snapping out of it, and going home?"`
`They say you don't get tired when you're having fun, but... Where in that slender body was Rena storing all this horsepower?`
`Rummaging through an oversized garbage heap was exhausting in and of itself.`
`It didn't take long for me to pull out a picnic blanket, spread it on a decommissioned vehicle's roof, and sprawl out on it.`
`"Nooo, that isn't it!`
` It's the time you spend looking and wondering what kind of kyute things you'll happen to find.`
` That's what makes it so much fun, even if you don't find anything."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Well, it wasn't boring for me, either.`
` Thanks to all the work, this bottle of barley tea you brought tastes great!`
` This is definitely better than the stuff at my house. `
`How should I put it—it's like they smell different, or something."`
`"That's the normal kind.`
` You just put a pack in a teapot and boil it to get the flavor."`
`"Oh, boiling it must be the secret!`
` We just dump cold water in and put it in the fridge.`
` I guess you don't get the flavor if you don't heat it up first."`
`"Oh, that's right, I forgot!"`
`Rena pounded her fist, then put her treasure hunting aside for the moment and came over to me.`
`Then, she brought over a bag and took something out before unwrapping it.`
`...Why, how considerate!`
` They're cookies!`
` Their lack of uniformity meant they had to be homemade.`
`"Did you make these yourself!?`
` I'd be glad to have some.`
` Mm, yep, these are great!"`
`"They're leftovers from yesterday.`
` Dad ate most of them, so there weren't many left.`
` Rena didn't even get to have that many."`
`"I see, I see, so I shouldn't eat them all myself.`
` I'll just eat half.`
` You have some too!`
` These are cookies after my own heart!`
` Mm, munch munch!`
` This flavor, this texture, oh, they're extraordinary!!"`
`"Rena doesn't need any, so you can eat them all, Keiichi-kun.`
` You look so happy with them, so both Rena and the cookies she made are really happy too."`
`"Really?`
` Guess I don't need to hold myself back!!`
` I could kill!`
` I could kill a man just to have one of these cookies!!`
` Munch munch munch!!"`
`"Ahahaha, that's a terrible thing to say, but I'm happy. I am!"`
`This fun moment sitting together...`
`Going with Rena on a treasure hunt was the right choice.`
`...If I only ended up shutting myself up in my room with Mion's comics, it would have been rude to the day itself!`
`Scarlet began to creep into the sky.`
`Flocks of birds started flying past...`
` Maybe they were going back to their nests.`
`Rena had already put away the cookie wrappers.`
` ...It looked like it was time to go.`
`"So what did you dig up today?"`
`"Hmm, hopes for tomorrow, I guess!`
`This pile goes a lot deeper~!`
` I'm sure something will turn up.`
` Rena can tell by the smell, hau~!!"`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` If you say something will turn up, I'm sure it will.`
` Don't lose heart!`
` Will it be gold, or a hot spring?!`
` I can't wait."`
`"If I go treasure hunting tomorrow too, will you come with me?"`
`"Hm?`
` Me?`
` Hmm.`
` I'll consider it if I can eat more of your homemade cookies."`
`"I-I didn't bake any more cookies, so I won't have them tomorrow...`
` ...If I don't make cookies...`
` you won't come?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ahahahaha, don't look at me with those eyes!`
` O-O-Okay, I get it!`
` I'll help you, so don't give me that look!`
` You'll break my glass conscience~!"`
`"Hee hee, ahahahahahaha!`
` I got Keiichi-kun to help me tomorrow~!`
` When Keiichi-kun is with me, hau, it's fun even if I don't find anything.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`Rena usually went treasure hunting alone, but she probably also had fun doing it with friends once in a while.`
`She gave me a fresh, invigorating smile, the kind she didn't usually show anyone during club games.`
`After that, we decided to clean up, pack up, and leave.`
`And the moment we went up the embankment, there was a sudden dazzling flash!`
`"Ack, my eyes!"`
`"Hah-hahaha!`
` Caught those blissful smiles on candid camera!"`
`"T-Tomitake-san.`
` And Takano-san, too!`
` Hello~!"`
`"Hee hee. Hello there.`
` Jirou-san has no tact, does he?`
` Wrecking your date like that..."`
`"I-It wasn't a date or anything...`
` Not a date, not a date!`
` Right, Rena?!"`
`"H-Hauuu."`
`"Ha ha ha ha!`
` A boy and a girl coming to an empty place like this to talk about the future?`
` Well, well, that's fine!`
` That's the kind of discussion that will strengthen the bond between you.`
` Right, Takano-san?"`
`"Hee hee.`
` Back when we first met, Jirou-san would always have the funniest, most awkward ways of asking me out.`
`I remember one masterful excuse in particular.`
` What was it..."`
`"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there!!`
` That was my mistake, and, well!!"`
`Takano-san ran off, giggling, and Tomitake-san chased after her.`
`From afar, they looked like they had to be a great couple.`
`"They seemed mismatched at first, but they like each other a lot."`
`"Yeah.`
` They have completely opposite personalities. Maybe they went together like the bumps and dents in puzzle pieces."`
`"Hau...`
` Just like a bump and a dent.`
` Hau hau,`
` what do you mean?`
` What do you mean?`
` What do you mean."`
`"N-N-N...`
` No, no, I wasn't trying to say anything weird!`
` Stop blushing! You're only making this more awkward!!"`
`"I wonder, I wonder!!`
` Bumps and dents~~ bump dent bump dent~!!`
` ○△凸※◎~!!!"`
`Ahhh, oh no, Rena's completely broken!`
`The only way to solve this is her usual method: punching me out cold.`
`All right, Rena, I'm prepared!`
` Give me your usual lightning-fast punch and KO me in an instant!!`
`But then, something flew towards Rena and clunked her in the head.`
` What was that?!`
`Rena suddenly choked up and fell to her knees, coughing over and over in a way that clearly wasn't normal.`
`"H-Hey, what's wrong?!`
` Are you okay, Rena?!"`
`I rubbed Rena's back as she coughed.`
` ...What the heck just happened?!`
`"What's the matter?!`
` Are you all right, Rena-chan?!"`
`"Hang on.`
` Can you breathe?!"`
`"Did you two throw something and hit Rena just now?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`I definitely saw it.`
` Something came flying and hit Rena in the head.`
`I was sure it was something Tomitake-san or Takano-san had thrown...`
` but they wouldn't do something so mean, would they?`
`Then what was it?`
` Are you telling me that whatever it was fell from the heavens, or something?`
`"Are you all right, Rena...?!`
` Do you need a handkerchief?"`
`"...Th... Thanks...`
` uuuu...`
` *cough* *cough*...!"`
`"Did you swallow something the wrong way?`
` Have you calmed down?"`
`"I-I was looking at the sky and fooling around...`
` when something suddenly flew into my mouth...`
` and I swallowed it...`
` uuuu..."`
`"Swallowed it!?`
` What did you swallow?`
` Does your stomach hurt or anything?!"`
`"It doesn't, but... I feel a little strange..."`
`"...I wonder why.`
` Did a bug fly into your mouth?"`
`"If it's bothering you, you should try vomiting.`
` They should have a sink at the office site you can use.`
` Drink a lot of water, then put your finger in the back of your throat and throw it all up."`
`"That's a good idea...!`
` Rena, I'll help you stand, so let's go!"`
`".........Huh...?`
` .........I feel better..."`
`"What?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` It felt like something was rolling around in my stomach, but it went away.`
` ...I don't feel it anymore."`
`"Are you sure it was nothing?`
` I hope you're all right..."`
`"...If it's really bothering you, we can take an X-ray of your stomach to see if there's a need to remove it.`
` Are you sure it was nothing?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Yep, I'm totally fine now.`
` Even I don't get it.`
` ...I'm fit as a fiddle."`
`"Really...?`
` Should we go to the clinic and have Coach look at you, just in case?"`
`"No, I'm good!`
` I'll do that if I feel sick tomorrow.`
` But I'm all better for today.`
` Thanks for worrying about me, everyone."`
`The person concerned said it was nothing, so there was no point in prying any further.`
`We said farewell to Tomitake-san and Takano-san, and then I walked Rena back to her house.`
`At first, I was worried about Rena suddenly growing worse. `
`But as I listened to her go on and on about how fun today's treasure hunt was, my worries drifted away, and we got to talking about going hunting again tomorrow.`
`"Bye, Keiichi-kun.`
` Thanks for taking me home!`
` If club tomorrow ends early, let's go treasure hunting together again!"`
`"Yeah!`
` And thanks for the cookies and barley tea today!!"`
`"It won't be homemade,`
` but I'll bring some kind of snack tomorrow.`
` Please look forward to it~!"`
`"Awesome!!`
` I can't wait!"`
`Rena's mood seemed so good that she was fit to burst.`
`As I watched her, I completely forgot about the fuss over the foreign object earlier...`
`"......It's already really dark out.`
` Why don't we do this tomorrow?`
` I don't want some old person to find me and say 'oh Rika-chama, you mustn't be walking alone at this hour.' `
`Most importantly, they can't see you."`
`"We can't, au au!`
` We have to find them as soon as we can!`
` ...Au!`
` I can feel energy waves from the sealed treasure...`
` It has to be around here somewhere.`
` Au au au au..."`
`"If only your ghost energy antenna was a little more precise...`
` We've been coming and going all over the village.`
` ...*yaaaaawn*...`
` I'm tired..."`
`"You don't know the terrible power of the Magatama of Fuwarazu.`
` If you did, you might be a little more enthusiastic about this!"`
`"They're mystical jewels that bind people in love, right?`
` If you give one of the pair of red and white magatama to your sweetheart, your love will be reciprocated.`
` Isn't that wonderful?"`
`"That's exactly why it's dangerous!`
` The young people around here would have a big, bloody war over them!!`
` One story says that a group of men started killing each other over a single maiden!"`
`"...It's nice being young, isn't it?`
` But I guess you're right—they shouldn't be lying by the roadside. `
`Perhaps once the Furude shrine maiden retrieves them, she'll have a little bit of fun with them before returning them to the heavens.`
` *giggle*"`
`"Nooo, you caaan't!!`
`Au au, we're getting closer, we're getting closer...!`
` Au au au au au au...`
` Ahhh!!!"`
`I thought I saw something glimmer on the dark night road.`
`It looked almost like luminous paint, and for a few moments, the light shone weakly...`
`"Is that it?!"`
`I pointed my flashlight at it and saw a small, open box on its side.`
`Though small, it had an intricate design, convincing me it would make sense if it held the Furude Shrine's treasure.`
`But the outside didn't matter.`
` What mattered was the inside.`
`"Ah!`
` ......Au au au au..."`
`"...Empty.`
` I see. The two magatama, one red and one white, would sit in these dents."`
`On the inside, it was made like a jewel box, empty save for the two depressions the Magatama probably fit into.`
`"I-It might be lying around nearby.`
` Let's look for it!"`
`"Why don't you use your ghost antenna?`
` A human can't search for such a little jewel in the dark."`
`"W...Well... Au.`
` I think my ghost energy transmitter is stuck on the box instead...`
` If they're not in the box, I can't search for them~~`
` Au au au!"`
`How useless...`
` Wait, transmitter? What?`
`I swung my flashlight about, but it was clear to me that even if it had been daytime, we wouldn't have been able to find anything in all the gravel and weeds.`
`The magatama were probably only the size of candies, judging by the size of the depressions in the box.`
`"They probably flew out when the box fell out of the sky and hit the ground.`
` ......And right next to the trash piles?`
` The day it falls down this slope and into that mess... it'll be over.`
` We'll never find it."`
`...Actually... What about Rena, lord of the trash piles?`
`The red and white jewels were called 'magatamas', but the pictures of them in the scroll looked more like key rings with seals on them.`
` To be frank, Rena's fingers would be just itching for these.`
`"Come to think of it... Rena said she was going to stop by the landfill, didn't she?`
` There was a new trash pile, so I think she wanted to go treasure hunting."`
`"Could Rena have picked them up...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` I'll ask her at school tomorrow.`
` Calling her this late would be pretty rude."`
`"...Au au..."`
`"Let's call it quits for today.`
` Satoko will get worried if I'm out any longer.`
` And if I read the scroll a little more closely, it might give us a hint, right?"`
`"...Au au au au."`
`Good grief.`
` This is one troublesome magic item that made its way into Hinamizawa...`
`...Wait, I end up reading old documents and treasure hunting no matter what scenario I'm in...`
`Ahh, it's true! Good grief...`
