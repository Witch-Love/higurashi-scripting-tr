`"Excellent work on Higurashi: When They Cry Rei~!`
` Bu-bum puff~!"`
`"Ever since Kai started, we've had this series of massive stories.`
` Little scenarios like this one are fine once in awhile too!"`
`"But wait!`
` Even a little knowledge can be dangerous, right?`
` Wasn't the first chapter, Saikoroshi, pretty heavy on the thematic side?"`
`"...It was.`
` Haven't we often given up on certain sacrifices, and blamed it all on the dice of fate?`
` Not being able to blame it on anyone seems a very painful choice."`
`"...I didn't really understand it, but I had no idea such a mean story would follow right after the grand finale in Matsuribayashi!"`
`"......I went through a lot of bad things in that story.`
` Meep."`
`"I was happy I got to make so many appearances. Au au☆"`
`"R...Really?`
` ...But if I put myself in the main character's shoes, it would really stink.`
`...If it were me, I think I'd have been worrying so much the time limit to go back to our original world would have run out."`
`"Huh?`
` Why worry?`
` That world was in a nightmare, right?`
` Didn't Hanyuu say that world was a dream at the end?`
` You'd just have to do your best to wake up from it!"`
`"No, Sis.`
` I thought that after she chose her original world, it would have been too much for her to think about the world she didn't choose, which is why Hanyuu told her it was a dream!"`
`"I think it was so she could sever any lingering attachments to it.`
` In the story, I said a few things about having regrets for the choices you don't pick."`
`"I think that either world would have been the real one, depending on what Rika chose...`
` If she'd chosen the other one, maybe her original world would have been the dream."`
`"......It might have all been a hallucination I saw when Satoko hit me with the ball and knocked me out."`
`"The scenario wanted Rika-chan to make a choice, so it made things tough for her.`
` ...But after all that, maybe a coin flip would have been easier for her to handle."`
`"Like I said during the story, I think that would have meant running away from the choice.`
` ...Whatever choice you make, if you made it yourself, you can be okay with it. `
`But if you didn't make the choice yourself, you'd have a reason to keep complaining forever."`
`"Yeah.`
` You have a choice to make before you even make the choice:`
` whether to choose or not."`
`"With some choices, there's just no way to pick one option.`
` That was probably the theme of Saikoroshi—the distress that can cause."`
`"That was really a cruel tale!`
` It made me out to be a cold person, and Rika hit me with a chair! It added insult to injury!"`
`"That doesn't matter!`
` This ol' man barely had any scenes!`
` But I guess it's okay~ I had a huge role during Matsuribayashi to make up for it!"`
`"I showed up a lot in both of them, so I'm nice and full~ Au au au☆"`
`"......Mm-hmm.`
` You appeared pretty often in Rei.`
` You didn't first show up until later, though, so perhaps it was all right."`
`"C-Come to think of it, Hirukowashi was all about me~!`
` And the story was a tiny bit lovey-dovey.`
` Hau!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Actually, the way your kyute mode sends you on a rampage reminded me of how I saw you way back at the beginning of Higurashi."`
`"This is just my impression after reading the story, but...`
` Sis.`
` You have to start pulling it together a little more, or she'll outdo you.`
` Rena-san is way more aggressive than we thought."`
`"...Meep."`
`"W-Wait, why is everyone taking pity on me?!`
` Huh?!`
` Why, why?!"`
`"Ahahahahaha. Not telling~☆`
`Anyway, Hirukowashi was a story based on motifs from the Higurashi Daybreak world, the fighting action game released by Twilight Frontier. `
`If you're interested after having read Hirukowashi, please go give that game a try!"`
`"Which tag team will get their hands on the love-creating Magatama of Fuwarazu?`
` Aside from me and Rena being on one team, there are plenty of storylines to experience, so give it a look! (shameless plug)"`
`"Hey, Shion-san?`
` Come to think of it, Hirukowashi had different BGM than usual, didn't it?"`
`"Good on you for keeping an ear out, Satoko. `
`You're right—in Hirukowashi, in order to give it more of a Daybreak feel, we borrowed several pieces actually used in Daybreak, composed by Twilight Frontier's composer, U2-san!"`
`"With different music than usual, our normal escapades felt very different too."`
`"Of course—this is a sound novel, so the sound is important.`
` The word 'sound' takes up an entire half of the term 'sound novel', after all."`
`"Yeah.`
` Music has immeasurable effects, and can make scenes much more exciting!`
`Thank you so much to all the composers who contributed to Higurashi!`
` If you can, we would very much like your help again on Umineko~!"`
`"Oh, oh, oh!`
` I've seen that name crop up on the blog on the circle's homepage.`
` Umineko: When They Cry, right?`
` The naming feels like a meme now, but that's really the new game coming out, isn't it?!"`
`"Well, the name is still provisional, but...`
` Aha, in Ryukishi07-san's words, it's 'set in stone, tentatively'..."`
`"...A lot of higurashi sounds were used all through Higurashi,`
` so with Umineko, does that mean a lot of seagulls will be crying?"`
`"What sound did seagulls make, again?`
` ...Squawk squawk?"`
`"It'll apparently take place on an island.`
` And with the words 'island' and 'ocean' in mind, seagulls come up as the natural animal you'd hear making noise in the background.`
` Heh heh!"`
`"Whaaat~~?!`
` They decided the title based on something so minor?!"`
`"Anyway, wouldn't it be more difficult if you didn't even have a temporary title?`
`You have to put together stuff like this beforehand, or you'll be in trouble later."`
`"He says it's only a tentative title, and if he comes up with something 'way cooler' he'll change it.`
`...Though I think it's probably already settled."`
`"I wonder what that story will be about.`
` It has the same 'When They Cry' in the title, after all.`
` I wonder if there'll be more strange crimes with people dying!"`
`"I don't think there's any doubt about that...`
` And I don't know who's gonna be the main character, but they'll have it rough. `
`In any case, if you had to choose a main character from this circle, you might want to give it some serious thought first..."`
`"He said something about it inheriting the blood of Higurashi: When They Cry,`
` but still wanting to aim for a different kind of world.`
` ...I don't really understand what he's talking about.`
` Heh heh."`
`"Ryukishi07-san said he'd start working on the plot for real after making the master copy of Rei.`
` I bet he's gotten all sorts of unpublished writings together already!"`
`"Look forward to Summer Comiket 2007, nipah~☆"`
`"...Well, this was certainly one high-and-mighty next episode preview. `
`Judging by how there aren't even any screenshots of it yet, he must have meant it when he said he'd start working on it for real after finishing Rei!"`
`Urk.`
`"Now, now!`
` Next year's summer Comiket is still eight months away.`
` We just have to relax and wait."`
`"Please keep checking the circle's development blog for progress~!`
` That does it for our PR announcements!"`
`"How did you like Higurashi: When They Cry Rei?`
` We hope you enjoyed it.`
`This volume was called 'Rei', meaning 'gratitude', because we wanted to thank all of those who enjoyed Higurashi and supported us.`
` If you've enjoyed it, then we couldn't possibly be happier."`
`"Right when we thought we wouldn't be showing up anymore after Matsuribayashi, too. We had a ton of fun appearing again like this!`
` Our Higurashi world antics are still a blast!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Maybe Higurashi's most interesting facet was having all kinds of stories—happy ones, angry ones, sad ones, and fun ones—and Saikoroshi and Hirukowashi both fit right in. `
`I had a lot of fun appearing in all sorts of different ways!"`
`"I still haven't shown up enough.`
` Is this the last time we'll be appearing?"`
`"Au au.`
` Ryukishi07 was thinking he wouldn't write any more Higurashi from now on, but he had a lot of fun writing these stories, so he might have changed his mind a little. `
`He said he'd still like to write a few more things if he has time."`
`"Ohh ho ho ho!`
` And that is how it should be!`
` I want him to write a lot more about how amazing I am!"`
`"...Our appearances...`
` Or, rather, Higurashi: When They Cry isn't over yet."`
`"Yep.`
` There's no such thing as an ending.`
` We're still living, and we'll have all kinds of experiences after this, and have many more chapters."`
`"Yeah!`
` As long as we're in Hinamizawa, there's no way weird stuff won't happen!"`
`"Ku-ku-ku!`
` That goes for more than just our club activities~!`
` There might be more horrific tragedies, too!"`
`"I'd very much like you to be in those tragedies, Sis.`
`Ahhh, but I want to be in a romance with Satoshi-kun!"`
`"That's right! We still haven't had a story where Nii-nii comes back!"`
`"...Ahahaha, you're right.`
` I'd like it if there was a story where I had something real to do."`
`"That's right!`
` I want to show up doing a lot more cool things too!`
` What about a Jirou Tomitake Stormcloud Chapter?!"`
`"Hee-hee.`
` Wouldn't a story depicting our adult relationship be a little too stimulating for all the good boys and girls?"`
`"How about we bring them a story about my splendid younger years to set an example for the youngsters?`
` Na ha ha ha!"`
`"I'd be interested in your days as a kid, Ooishi-san.`
` And I'd like to see a story about my own mahjong days."`
`"Sheesh. It's all over the moment you start rambling on about your younger days.`
` I don't care about my days as a greenhorn—I want to be the main character and have a major role.`
` Don't you?"`
`"You jest...`
` Flashy roles? No thank you.`
` What about you, Chie-sensei?`
` You're young, so I'm sure you want a more important role."`
`"...If someone gave me the chance, maybe I would, but...`
` If I was the protagonist,`
` well,`
` ...I think they'd have to change the title...`
` What about you, Irie-sensei?`
` Would you like to be one?"`
`"Who, me?!`
` Well, of course—if someone called on me to do it, I'd take on the role!`
` Everyone born into this world wants to be a main character at least once.`
`What about you, Okonogi-san?`
` You were very powerful, so I'm sure you want to be in the spotlight!"`
`"Hah-hahahaha...`
` I'm fine with my role as villain.`
` If I had the chance, I'd like to make even more of a mess of things."`
`"Me too!`
` I'm fine being a villain, but I just want to show up again!`
` It's only because we're such great villains that the main characters look so good!"`
`"I've had enough of being the villain. A good guy role would be nice for next time.`
` I know it was just an act, but bullying little girls doesn't suit me.`
` Right, Satokooo~! `
`I hope we're good pals in the next story~!"`
`"Ohh ho ho ho!`
` Being on good terms with you, Teppei-san, would make the story a bit embarrassing for me!"`
`"...Even them getting along in just the after party feels very, very odd."`
`"Au au☆`
` But everyone here got to put on a performance together, so it was really fun."`
`"I hope we all have the chance to perform again together... To perform again."`
`"Course we will.`
` If we all wish for it, we're sure to meet again!`
`After all, the main story is already over!`
` And in extra stories, anything goes.`
` I can't wait to see what kind of nonsensical stories we'll be called in for next time!!"`
`"Ku ku ku. And maybe 07th Expansion will finally break into adult stories~?!"`
`"Ahh! But if Satoshi-kun really insisted, I might not be able to refuse.`
` Satoshi-kuuun!"`
`"I-I... I'd like a story that both adults and children can enjoy."`
`"That's right!`
` Shion-san should keep her unclean stories with Nii-nii inside her head!"`
`"...Meep!`
` If it's okay to dream, then I would like a very charming little story where I've grown up and have a nice body."`
`"Au au au!`
` I want a story where everyone respects me more!`
` I'm a god!`
` You should all be worshipping me~!"`
`"Ahahaha, nobody's had enough yet.`
` I feel like we'll have to meet again together in a new story.`
` We're really grateful to everyone, for continuing to follow Higurashi: When They Cry up until today. `
`On behalf of all the characters appearing in Higurashi, we'd like to extend our thanks.`
` The only reason we made it to this point was because of how much you all supported us.`
` Thank you so, so much."`
`"We're looking forward to meeting again in some odd and special stories!`
` Are you ready, everyone?`
` One, two..."`
`"""Thank you for everything you've done for us!`
` Let's meet again~!!"""`
