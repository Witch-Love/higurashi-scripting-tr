`The cicadas' chorus had been growing increasingly lively.`
`The strange weather during that neverending June had been hot enough to make us feel like summer had come early.`
`But, even so, it was still only June.`
`Once we got closer to summer in July, the season graced us with even more summery weather.`
`Today, to fulfill my dream, we all went to play at the swimming pool.`
`The dream might have seemed humble at first, but I didn't have to look back on the hundred years' journey it took to achieve it anymore.`
`Still, I decided I shouldn't forget about it.`
`For many people, this was a perfectly ordinary day, but for me, it had taken so many years of wandering just to get here that it made me feel faint.`
`And remembering it made this seemingly average, regular life fill me with such profound happiness.`
`"Wow, ha ha ha!`
` Not bringing a camera today must be Mion Sonozaki's greatest failure."`
`"Hau, I don't need a camera~.`
` I've burned this into my memory already.`
`When I close my eyelids, I can still see how cute Keiichi looks~. Hau~☆"`
`"Gah!!`
` Don't look at them, don't!`
` I'll file your eyelids off your face!!"`
`"That's what you get for forgetting to bring your swimsuit to the pool.`
` And the whole ruckus about you putting on those shady swim trunks, too, from beginning to end—you reap what you sow!"`
`"...Keiichi, you should thank Mii.`
` If she hadn't brought those swan underpants, your 'swan' would have been swinging all over.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"Heh heh heh heh!`
` Boy, was that a joy to behold.`
`I didn't plan anything specific for today, and just when I was thinking we'd play some nice, quiet pool games... heh heh heh heh!`
`Well, with this group, it would be stranger if something didn't happen!"`
`"No, that's definitely wrong!`
` If you hadn't planned anything, you wouldn't have bothered to bring those embarrassing swan underpants here in the first place!! `
`You were scheming, looking for some excuse to get me to wear them! I'm sure of it!!"`
`"A ha ha ha ha, but today was really fun, so I'm totally satisfied! I am!"`
`"It certainly was fun!`
` On that point, I quite agree!"`
`Satoko smiled at me, looking for my agreement.`
`So I sent her back just as brilliant a smile, expressing just how much fun all the romping about today had been.`
`As we all reminisced on our romp at the pool today, we got on our bikes and started on our way home.`
`Hinamizawa didn't have any pools, so we'd gone to a public pool in Okinomiya.`
`There was an elevation difference between the two communities, and while going downhill had been very pleasant, we had a long trip upward on our way back.`
`For Hinamizawa children at the zenith of their energy, it wasn't much of a chore, but we naturally fell silent as we quietly pedaled up the hill.`
`Seeing everyone so silent made me want to screw things up somehow.`
`Messing with Satoko at times like these was so much fun for me that you could call it the very purpose of my existence.`
`I pedaled harder, caught up to Satoko's bicycle as she pedaled in silence, and gave her a nudge on the shoulder.`
`"Uwa, ack!`
` R-Rikaaa!!"`
`"Meep!"`
`After pretending to be mean to Satoko, I sped up.`
`Of course, she sped up too and chased after me.`
`Satoko struggled to somehow nudge me back, but I was no slouch either.`
`Our speeds naturally increased, and we began to quickly pass the others in the group.`
`"What's this? A race~?!`
` This ol' man won't lose either!"`
`"You shouldn't fool around on the road!`
` It's dangerous, Rika-chan, Satoko-chan!"`
`This was a public road, and cars sometimes came and went.`
`But we'd lived here a long time, so we knew not many cars came around at this hour.`
`"Rikaa!`
` A car is coming!!"`
`"...Meep~!`
` I won't fall for that trick!"`
`So when Satoko said that, I thought she was just trying to distract me.`
`A car horn.`
`When I heard it, I realized Satoko's warning wasn't a trick.`
` ...But it was so sudden that I was overtaken with surprise.`
`When I looked in front of me, the car was right there.`
`I panicked and violently swung my handlebars.`
`The motion was more than aggressive and sudden enough to throw me off-balance.`
`As my body lurched forward, I realized I was flying through the air.`
` ...My nose caught the whiff of asphalt, telling me I was a moment away from being hurt.`
`"Riikaaaaaaa!!!"`
`I heard Satoko shriek.`
`...No. The sensation I was experiencing was so unreal that I only could say I <i>thought</i> I heard her.`
`I couldn't even figure out if the sight of the car coming towards me as I hurtled through the air was real.`
`But that absence of reality probably only lasted about one second.`
`I wasn't even given the time to say "oops."`
