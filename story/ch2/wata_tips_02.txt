`"Huh?`
` Mion-san's family?"`
`"Yeah.`
` More broadly, I was just wondering if she had any brothers or anything."`
`I was actually wondering whether her younger twin sister named Shion really existed,`
` and my curiosity got the better of me, so I quietly asked Satoko about it.`
`"...Hmmm.`
` ...I wonder...`
` She might, she might not..."`
`She wasn't being very clear about it.`
`...Had Satoko never gone over to Mion's house to play?`
`"From your reaction... I guess you've never met any."`
`"Yes.`
` I've never seen any of her relatives except for her grandmother."`
`As far as I could tell... there were already dark clouds over the "Shion is real" theory.`
`"Rika would know more than I.`
` You would do well to ask her."`
`Satoko waved to Rika-chan, who was basking in the sunlight.`
`"Rika!`
` Do you know anything about Mion-san's family?"`
`Rika-chan was surprised at the sudden question.`
`"......Mii has a big family, so I don't really know everything about them."`
`"That many, huh...?`
` For example...`
` ...Hmm.`
` Is there someone named Shion Sonozaki?`
` Umm, well... I might have heard wrong, so she might not actually exist, but..."`
`"......You mean Shii?`
` Shion exists."`
`Huh?`
`That was unexpected.`
` So she was real...!`
`"Hmm?`
` Their names are quite similar, you know.`
` I could get tongue-tied trying to tell the difference."`
`"......I've heard she's Mii's younger twin sister, but I haven't met her too many times."`
`Rika-chan knew a bit about her as well, but hadn't seen her much.`
`"......I think I met her once at a funeral a few years ago."`
`"She's not in this class, so maybe she goes to school in Okinomiya."`
`"She may live there, too.`
` Mion-san herself lives apart from her family with her grandmother, after all."`
`She didn't live with her parents?`
` That was a bit odd.`
` Was there something between them?`
`"......It's a very complicated family."`
`"She seems to have many relatives.`
` There are doubtless many different circumstances."`
`For now, I learned that she had a younger twin sister named Shion, but her family structure, including her own position, still seemed very mysterious...`
`"Oh, what are the three of you talking about?`
` Let this old man in on it!"`
`"Oh, Mion-san, you've come at a good time~!`
` Might it be true that you have a younger twin sister?"`
`Ah... Mion... crap...`
`"...A... a younger sister...!?`
` Um, well...... y-yeah.`
` I do..."`
`Mion grew uncharacteristically red in the face, at a loss.`
`...I think she's looking at me...`
`"Oh, my~!`
` I had no idea~!`
` What kind of person might she be?`
` I would very much like to meet her sometime!!"`
`"You shouldn't bother!`
` Sh-She's not cute at all!`
` She's really conceited!`
` Besides, other than talking to her on the phone once in a while... I haven't seen her for a long time, either...!"`
`...Why did it look like she was in such a panic...?`
`It's like she was declaring that the Shion from yesterday was actually a fake...`
`Anyway, this was pretty funny, so I let it go for a little while longer.`
`...Another Mion, under the name of Shion.`
`...Will I be able to see her if I go to that restaurant again?`
`I had a mysterious feeling, as if I'd made a new friend, despite knowing that she and Mion were the same person.`
