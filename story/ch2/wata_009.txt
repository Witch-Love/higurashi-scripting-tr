`I let out a great big yawn.`
`It was like morning had arrived just as I got to sleep...`
`As Mom set up breakfast, she gave me a pained smile.`
`"What's the matter, Keiichi?`
` What time did you go to sleep last night?"`
`"Well, I wanted to go to sleep at midnight... but I had some trouble with that..."`
`"You were probably all worked up from the festival."`
`"N-No, that's not it...! Crunch crunch!"`
`I crunched down hard on the pickled radish to hide my embarrassment.`
`...After all that happened yesterday, and our discussion about the sound Shion heard...`
`...That banging noise, like a child far away, jumping up and down on a wooden floor.`
`The story wouldn't get out of my head, so I had trouble sleeping...`
`It was a long night...`
` ...and I kept jumping at the slight sounds of faraway tree branches, which should have been either unhearable or too insignificant to notice.`
`When I woke up to the morning sunlight and birds chirping, it made me feel pretty ashamed about it, but...`
`...I felt far from refreshed this morning.`
`"Keiichi-kuuun! Good morning!`
` Huh?`
` Keiichi-kun, your eyes are all red!`
` Why is that? Why?"`
`"Oh, hey, good morning.`
` I didn't get much sleep last night.`
` So I'm sleep deprived today.`
` ...*yaaawn*"`
`"The festival yesterday was a lot of fun...!`
` Rena's excitement took a long time to go to sleep, so I took a long time to go to sleep too! To sleep!"`
`In Rena's case, her excitement seemed to still be wide awake...`
`"They should have this kind of festival more often!`
` So we can have lots of fun together again. Hau!"`
`"Mm, ah... Yeah."`
`Rena talking about the festival yesterday made me remember everything I had nearly forgotten from last night.`
`...The inside of the ritual storehouse had been so utterly different from the relaxed, bright everyday life of Hinamizawa.`
`All those stories that Takano-san told me, too...`
`The mysterious incidents that occurred on the day of the Watanagashi Festival every year.`
`The strange incidents where one person would die, and one would disappear.`
`...The old stories of Hinamizawa, flickering like a candle behind them.`
` The numerous and horrifying traditions of Onigafuchi Village.`
`The villagers with demon blood in them.`
`The terrible, cannibalistic feasts.`
`The poor sacrifices kidnapped from human villages, victims...`
` ...of the Onikakushi.`
`To quell the rage of Oyashiro-sama... the ritual involving living sacrifices.`
`......There were also many, many others.`
` ...There were so many stories that just remembering them put me in a foul mood.`
`Most of them weren't fiction, either—they were true.`
`...We didn't need to fear them just because they were real, though.`
` ...Since it all happened so long ago.`
` Such a very long time ago.`
`"Where's Mii-chan? She's late."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Before I realized it, we had arrived at the place where we'd usually meet with Mion.`
`...Probably because I was so lost in thought.`
`"We agreed that if she isn't here by now, we can just go on ahead, right?`
` ...Should we?"`
`Mion being late wasn't too rare an occurrence... but today she was unusually late.`
`......A few of the ominous tales from the night before came back to life in my mind again.`
`Who would die this year, and who would disappear...`
`......I-It couldn't have been... Mion...?`
`"What should we do, Keiichi-kun?`
` ...If we don't get going, we'll be late."`
`"...She'll be here.`
` She didn't call to tell us she'd be staying home today, right?`
` Let's just wait five more minutes. Okay?"`
`Rena looked at her watch and seemed a little worried, but then she nodded with a satisfied smile.`
`Hmm...`
`If we had to wait five minutes, we'd have to run as fast as we could to school or we'd be late...`
`As soon as I thought that, we spotted Mion, running towards us, out of breath.`
`"Mii-chaaaaan!!`
` You're laaaate!!"`
`"Hah!`
` Hah!`
` ...You waited?`
` Y-You should have just gone on ahead..."`
`...Mion was breathing heavily, and her face was all red.`
`...Her house was right down this road, wasn't it?`
` It wasn't far enough away for her to end up like this, was it?`
`"......Mii-chan,`
` ...Are you not feeling well?"`
`Huh?`
` ...Now that she mentioned it...`
`...Rena pushed Mion's bangs away and put her hand to her forehead.`
`"...Rena, your hand is pretty cold."`
`"Mii-chan... You're a little bit warm."`
`"It's no big deal.`
` ...Give it half a day and I'll be fit as a fiddle."`
`"Are you really okay?`
` ...You don't have to push yourself, you know."`
`"What's this?`
` Kei-chan, are you worried about me?`
` Ahaha... That's nice of you."`
`...That answer wasn't like Mion at all.`
`...She must have had it pretty bad.`
`"I-I just think you shouldn't push yourself so hard.`
` We can tell the teacher you had to take the day off."`
`"I'm fine, I'm fine!`
` I took some medicine.`
` I think it's already working."`
`Mion forced an energetic expression onto her face and flexed her biceps at us.`
`"Okay... then let's go.`
` Don't overdo it... but, of course, there's...`
` ...the time."`
`"Wah?!`
` W-We need to run or we won't m-make it~!!"`
`"Ah-hahahaha!`
` This morning sure is thrilling!`
` Maybe it's just what I need to shake off this slowness!`
` Let's run!"`
`Hey, wait... You're sick! Don't go overboard...!`
`Mion began to run vigorously anyway.`
`"...Mii-chan is older than us, right?`
` She knows her own body better than anyone."`
`I decided to leave it at that and assume she was fine.`
`"Great, then we should get going too!!"`
`We began to run after Mion...`
`The school looked the same as always.`
`The hours passed listlessly, and my lack of sleep took its toll...`
`If there was a sport where people competed by sleeping, I'd be world champion right now.`
`The trick to overcoming this sort of dangerous situation was to hold your pencil upside-down.`
`...Why, you ask?`
`So you don't draw strange patterns all over your notes while half-asleep.`
`If you were holding your pencil upside-down, that wouldn't happen, would it?`
`Bump bump bump!`
` Bump bump bump!`
`Something that felt like an eraser hit me in the head six times.`
`"Ow, ow... What was that for, Satoko?!"`
`"I-I haven't done a single thing...!"`
`"Who else would play a prank on me like this?!`
` Oh, it was chalk, not an eraser.`
` ......Eh?"`
`Behind me... like a female outlaw might hold razors, was the teacher's shadow, holding three pieces of chalk in each hand...`
` Rumble rumble rumble......`
`"Maebara-kun.`
` ...Go and wash your face."`
`"Uh,`
` ......R-Right,`
` g-gladly...!"`
`That alone was enough to wake me up... but I flew out into the hallway, as if shoved out by the pressure exuded by the teacher's sheer power.`
`If I was going to wash my face anyway, then I would rather use the sinks out front, rather than the ones in the dark restroom.`
` ...Thinking that, I left the hallway and went to the entrance.`
`The sunlight was strong.`
` ...So strong you wouldn't think it was June.`
`I turned the faucet, and with a lifeless bubbling noise, lukewarm water came pouring out.`
`...If I let it run for a few moments, would it get cold?`
`...I looked at it absent-mindedly for a little while.`
`"I knew you'd choose these sinks, Kei-chan.`
` The ones out front just feel better, don't they?"`
`"Hm... Mion?`
` ...*Yaaawn*`
` No cutting class now~"`
`I stuck my hands into the water to find it had gotten so cold that it seemed strange it had ever been warm.`
`I scooped it up and splashed it against my face.`
`Once I was done, I moved out of the way and Mion did the same.`
`"...Mion, how is your cold doing?`
` You're sleepy because of the medicine, not from lack of sleep, right?"`
`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And well... I had a bit."`
`A bit.`
`She made a gesture like she was tilting a cup into her mouth.`
` ...Which means you didn't have a cold or anything...`
`"A-Are you hung over?!`
` How old are you?!!"`
`"Nahahaha...!`
` Give me a break.`
` I really don't feel well, you know!"`
`...I suppose she'd be feeling lousy either way.`
` Still, you treat colds and hangovers in completely different ways.`
`"I was worried over nothing.`
` Man... I guess that's just like you, Mion..."`
`Mion scratched her head, a little embarrassed.`
`...She didn't seem to be feeling well, but now that I knew it was a hangover, I didn't need to worry too much.`
` It would go away with time, after all.`
`"Oh, but my head really is pounding, so`
` the teacher told me I should go home early."`
`"Ack, you cheater...!`
` So are you going home now, Mion?"`
`Now that I looked again, Mion had her bag with her. She must have been on her way home.`
`"Yep. I feel bad about it, though.`
` I'll get some rest at home like a good girl.`
` ...Sorry I can't make it to the club.`
` Would you take over as leader for today, Kei-chan?"`
`"......I don't know if that will happen.`
` We have that unspoken rule where we don't do the club unless everyone is there, don't we?`
` We never did it when you had to go to your part-time job, did we?"`
`Mion laughed wryly, saying we didn't need to worry about her.`
`No matter how much fun we have, though, I think that feeling guilty about friends who can't share in it is the sign of a really fantastic friendship.`
`In that sense, the club Mion has created is a wonderful thing.`
`As I thought about it, the moisture on my washed face dried up.`
`...I suppose we were talking too much.`
` If I didn't get back to the classroom soon, I could get in trouble.`
`"Okay, later.`
` I'm going back.`
` Be careful on your way home.`
` Don't wobble into a sewer or a brook, got it?"`
`I left it at that, turned around, and started heading back to the classroom.`
`"Oh, ...One more thing, Kei-chan."`
`Mion stopped me, and I turned my head to listen.`
`"What's up?"`
`"This may sound weird, but don't think too hard about it."`
`"Well, that depends on what it is."`
`"Last night, near the end of the festival.`
` ...Did you see Tomitake-san or Takano-san anywhere?"`
`......I suddenly tensed up.`
`"You know Tomitake-san and Takano-san, right?`
` You remember, Kei-chan, when the four of you were talking during setup the day before?"`
`If I could, I wanted to forget about sneaking into the storehouse that night as soon as possible.`
`...So hearing the names of the people I was with at the time really got to me.`
`...Besides that, though.`
`...Why was Mion... asking me a question like that...?`
`I ended up staring at her, unable to answer immediately...`
`...Was she asking to see if I had seen them or not, or was she asking the question knowing that I had...? I couldn't tell.`
`"......W-Well... Maybe?`
` ...I might have seen them around, I don't know..."`
`My vague response was clearly not to Mion's liking.`
`...What answer was she expecting from me...? There was no way for me to know.`
`"............I see.`
` Then, one more question.`
` On the same night,`
` did you see Shion?"`
`My heart leapt into my throat again.`
` ......The tiny needles buried underneath Mion's words pricked into me.`
`"...That... didn't you ask me that yesterday?`
` ...I think I told you that I wasn't sure if I had or not..."`
`"Hm, did you?`
` ...I guess I just thought I'd get a different answer if I asked you again."`
`I suddenly noticed something in Mion's eyes... something indescribable.`
`Tomitake-san and Takano-san.`
`Shion, too.`
`...She was asking me about them.`
`......There was no doubt about it.`
`...Last night, the four of us snuck into the ritual storehouse... she knew everything.`
`...S-So... So what?!`
` There's not really a curse anyway......!`
`...That's right.`
`Even Shion and Takano-san said yesterday during the festival that there was no curse.`
`...And that rather than a curse, it was the doing of the villagers...`
` ..................................My blood curdled.`
`...Mion was...`
` ...almost without a doubt...`
` ...aware that we snuck into the storehouse...?`
`It was nothing strange.`
`......I screwed up bad flipping on the light switch last night.`
`...If Mion had been searching for me, it was simple to imagine... that she had seen that momentary light and come to find out what was going on.`
`"...Did you really not see her?"`
`"W-Why are you so intent on knowing if I did or not?"`
`"It's not important.`
` ...It's just that there are some people...`
` ...who are speaking poorly of Tomitake-san, Takano-san, Shion, and you, Kei-chan.`
` ......I didn't really hear what they were saying, though."`
`Unpleasant sweat dripped down my arms... and the sound of it hanging from my fingertips was so annoyingly loud...`
`"I don't believe that you were doing something bad.`
` ...I just wanted to ask a bit about it, so I did.`
` ...Sorry for making you uncomfortable, okay?"`
`......I found myself unable to reply.`
`...My reaction must have made it obvious what the truth was... and yet I couldn't explain myself.`
`"Kei-chan, you weren't with Tomitake-san, Takano-san, or Shion.`
` ...Right?"`
`"......Um.`
` ......Yeah."`
`I finally wrung out an answer between ragged breaths. Mion's expression softened a little.`
`"...That's good.`
` I'll have to tell them.`
` You weren't involved in anything bad, Kei-chan,`
` so... I'll make sure to tell everyone."`
`...Yeah... please do.`
`...Tell them I wasn't... doing anything bad.`
`...To everyone... make sure...`
` ......Everyone.`
` ......Everyone... who is everyone...?`
`"Okay, later.`
` I'll be better tomorrow!`
` Bye-bye!"`
`W-Wait, Mion!!`
` What do you mean by 'everyone'...?!!`
`Just then!!`
` A freezing cold hand touched the back of my neck!!!!`
`"Hey!`
` You're late, Maebara-kun.`
` How long does it take you to wash your face?"`
`......It was the teacher.`
`...I was taking so long she came out to get me...`
`"Ah, I'm sorry...`
` I was just speaking to Mion......"`
`I turned around, but Mion had crossed through the schoolyard without me realizing it and was now standing at the gate.`
`"Come, back to your studies!`
` Quickly now."`
`The teacher was being insistent. We returned to the entrance.`
`...I looked back one more time, and Mion was nowhere in sight.`
`"......Keiichi, you haven't seemed well all day."`
`"It's clearly because he had far too much fun yesterday!"`
`"I don't want to be told that by the one who got lost. Your face was all red and you were nearly crying!"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha~!!`
` S-Satoko-chan was so...so kyuute last night! Hau~!!"`
`My friends did their best to try and cheer me up... but it didn't lighten my mood.`
`Was it far worse than I thought?`
` ...Had I really done something that terrible last night...?`
`These thoughts remained with me... for the rest of the day.`
`"...Bye, Keiichi-kun.`
` I'll see you tomorrow!"`
`By the time I realized it, I was in front of my own house.`
`"...Mii-chan had a cold, right?`
` ...Could you have a cold too, Keiichi-kun? Could you?"`
`"Huh? ...I'm fine.`
` I may look scrawny, but I've never missed school because of a cold!"`
`"Both you and Mii-chan didn't look so good today, though..."`
`"...Thanks for worrying about me.`
` I'm fine! Idiots don't catch colds, remember?"`
`Rena smiled, then waved to me and left.`
`...Hoo.`
`...With my shoulders bobbing up and down from breathing heavily, I entered the house.`
`As soon as I got back in, Mom called out to me.`
`"What?"`
`"Keiichi?`
` I'm sorry, but could you go to the library and return a few books for me?"`
`"...Huh? I don't feel like it...!"`
`"Your dad and I have to wait inside the house for a phone call right now, so we can't leave.`
` I need to return them today. Could you please do it?"`
`......Sheesh.`
`Did it have to do with Dad's job?`
` No point in arguing if they bring that up.`
`"I guess so... but`
` I don't know where the library is."`
`"Oh, you don't?`
` It's a little bit past Okinomiya Station..."`
`Just then, the phone rang.`
`My parents' faces immediately turned grim.`
` ...Mom snatched up the receiver.`
`"Hello!`
` Maebara speaking.`
` ......`
` I'm sorry?`
` Yes. He's right here."`
`Then she thrust the receiver at my face.`
`"It's for you, Keiichi.`
` Don't take too long, okay?"`
`I tried to ask who it was from, but asking the person on the phone directly would be faster.`
`"Hello?"`
`"Ah... This is Sonozaki. Well, the younger one.`
` Hello.`
` Do you have time to talk right now?"`
`It was Shion.`
`...The older sister had a hangover today, but the younger made no reference to it.`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be sleeping in today with a hangover, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` Mion had a hangover?`
` Ah-hahahaha! That's so like her~~!"`
`She laughed warmly, but Mom glared at me, silently telling me to finish up.`
`"......Whoops... sorry.`
` My parents are waiting for an important call, so I can't talk for too long.`
` ...What do you need?"`
`"...There's something I wanted to talk about... but if we can't talk long, I guess that's that..."`
`She sounded a little disappointed.`
`...What would Shion want to talk to me about?`
` Now I was interested.`
`"Then how about we meet in person?`
` If you could show me where the library is too, that would be great."`
`"You mean the public library near the station?`
` Yes, that's fine.`
` I go past there on my way to work anyway."`
`"Okay, then you know where I usually meet up with Mion?`
` At that intersection where the small path from the Sonozaki house splits—"`
`"Oh, Kei-chan,`
` did I not tell you?`
` I don't live at the main house; I live in Okinomiya.`
` If we could meet by the ticket machines at Okinomiya Station, that would be great."`
`Main house?`
`Living in Okinomiya?`
`......Now that she mentioned it, it's always seemed like the Sonozaki sisters weren't communicating... did they live in different houses?`
`Also now that she mentioned it, Rena said she'd never met the younger sister, despite going over to play sometimes.`
`"Let's meet at the station, then.`
` I'll go there right away.`
` Bye!"`
`I set the receiver down, and Mom immediately thrust a large pile of library books in my face.`
`...Six volumes of long-form mystery novels.`
` ...Mom had her own hobbies.`
`"Thank you, Keiichi.`
` Be back by nightfall."`
`"Got it.`
` Okay, I'm going."`
`I supposed I'd change my clothes and grab my bike key.`
`I climbed the stairs to my bedroom.`
`Shion had been waiting for me already, so meeting up was a smooth process.`
`"Wow, Mion never keeps her appointments...`
` I mean, honestly."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Making my sister the standard for everything will get you in trouble."`
`Hm?`
`Shion seemed a little unsteady too.`
` ...She was drinking with Mion last night, wasn't she?`
`"You didn't get any sleep last night either, did you?`
` Don't try and hide it!`
` You definitely went home from school early."`
`"Ooh, too bad!`
` I've been at home all day in the first place.`
` I'm smarter than Mion, after all."`
`Hey...`
`I don't think you can call playing hooky 'smarter'...`
`"You should finish your errand first.`
` We don't have that much time.`
` ...We're going to the library, right?"`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` My mom had to return some books by today.`
` ...Is the library far?"`
`"No, it's really close by."`
`As she said that, we spotted the signboard for the library almost immediately.`
`If it was this easy to find, then I guess I didn't need Shion to show me where it was after all...`
`We rode around a bend and the building was right there.`
`Shishibone Public Library.`
`We lived in the country, so I hadn't expected too much... but it was pretty big.`
`The first floor was actually a government office, so the library was only on the second floor, but it still looked large enough to fit a decent collection of books.`
`We passed through the automatic doors and were greeted by the cool breeze of an air curtain.`
`The cicadas had been loud outside, but it was quiet inside the library.`
`The air conditioning inside was keeping the temperature at an ideal level for the books, which had that mildewy smell unique to old paper...`
`"...I guess every library is basically the same."`
`If there was one difference... it was that people studying for tests weren't taking up all the seats.`
`I was one of those people, but now that seemed like a distant memory.`
`"Hello, I have books I'd like to return."`
`The librarian went through the process of checking them in, and then returned my Mom's library card.`
`Shion was going around the bookshelves with a deeply interested look on her face, like she wasn't the type who went to libraries very often.`
`"...Sorry for the wait.`
` I'm all done."`
`"Libraries sure are nice and cool, aren't they~`
` I want to work in a library one day."`
`"Don't know whether to call that boring or dependable... It's a pretty small dream compared to your sister."`
`Mion would definitely want to be a hardworking employee for an international trading company, or some other crazy job that involved her running all around the world.`
`Compared to that... what Shion said is pretty heart-warming.`
`"Well, we need to keep our differences dear to us.`
` We're not copies—we're two different people, called Shion and Mion."`
`"...Twins have a lot to think about, huh?`
` Still, it sounds like fun.`
` ...I don't have any brothers, so there's just me and my parents at my house.`
` It can get a little uncomfortable."`
`"It's the same for me.`
` I don't live with Mion, after all."`
`Oh, right, she said something like that, didn't she...`
` Why, though?`
` Sisters living apart is unusual.`
`We were getting tired of talking while we were walking.`
`...We ended up going to the lounge area, which was vacant, and continuing the conversation.`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Yes.`
` Mion lives at the main house, and I live in Okinomiya."`
`"What do you mean by 'main house'?`
` ...You make it sound like you're nobility."`
`"It's just the main house.`
` The Sonozaki family's main house.`
` Mion's the successor, so she lives with Nana and apparently studies all sorts of things as preparation to be the head of the family."`
`Mion... the head of the family?`
`It kind of fit her personality, but kind of didn't, too...`
`"Kei-chan, you just moved here, right?`
` ...This will sound like I'm boasting, but we of the Sonozaki family are kind of personages around here."`
`"Huh? ...Seriously?"`
`The word "personage" didn't really match the extremely sociable air that Mion and Shion gave off.`
`From what Shion explained... The Sonozaki family goes way back to the beginnings of Hinamizawa. After the war, they had a bunch of successful ventures and extended their influence to a wide area.`
`"The Sonozaki house is a foundation under which the entire family cooperates.`
` ...Though the current family head, Grandma, was the one who built it."`
`The entire family would provide backup to help one relative with a business venture...`
` They were like a huge, living company.`
`This let them avoid tax-related problems and help relatives' ventures succeed, one after another, using large amounts of money.`
`"If you ever go for a walk through Okinomiya, pay attention to the signboards and stuff.`
` There's a ton of shops that are managed by members of the Sonozaki family."`
`"...Now that you mention it...`
` That toy store looked like it was managed by relatives as well.`
` Does that mean your relatives operate Angel Mort too?"`
`...Even what few shops I was familiar with were involved with the Sonozaki family...`
` It was definitely surprising.`
`"The family is particularly strong in finance and real estate.`
` Even a lot of members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry either have the last name Sonozaki, or are their relatives. `
`There are Sonozakis in the city council and the prefectural assembly, too, since they have the Okinomiya area giving them strong electoral support."`
`"......Wait a minute.`
` ...This is all... escalating pretty quickly."`
`Her relatives operate shops in downtown Okinomiya, and they're especially strong in finance and real estate...?`
`On top of that, a lot of those in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry are relatives, and there are even people elected to local offices...`
`"...So then...`
` ......The Sonozaki family, it's... it's pretty famous in this area...?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's crazy.`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`All of a sudden, a cigarette-smoking, overweight old man interrupted our conversation.`
`...Wait... I know this guy......`
`"Hello!`
` Good afternoon.`
` Are you on a date today?`
` Ah, what I would give to be young again."`
`"If you thought we were on a date, then why are you bothering us...`
` Ooishi-san?"`
`That was it.`
` He was Ooishi-san, a police officer.`
`...I thought it was this person who came to my rescue when I got involved with those delinquents before.`
` ......Now that I thought about it, Mion didn't seem to like him very much.`
`"No, no, I apologize.`
` I heard a familiar voice, so I came over to see."`
`Ooishi-san laughed coarsely, not showing any sign of giving up.`
`...As Shion watched him do so, I didn't feel the same sense of malice from her as I had from Mion.`
`"Maebara-san, right?`
` You're one tough guy.`
` Two-timing the Sonozaki sisters, are you?"`
`"No, I... I'm not two-timing anyone..."`
`I turned around to look at Shion and plead for help, but she grinned and maintained her silence.`
`Her gaze wandered.`
` ...She looked at the clock.`
`"Ah, I'm sorry, Kei-chan.`
` ...I really need to get to my job."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh... did you?"`
`Wait... Didn't Shion have something to talk about today...?`
`...Now this weird man is here, though...`
`"Yep. I'll see you later...`
` Oh, I'll give you a call after I'm done.`
` It'll be okay to call at night, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Probably okay."`
`"Then I'll talk to you later tonight.`
` Bye!"`
`Shion left so fast she was practically running.`
`...Ooishi-san was waving at me with a grin.`
`......I felt like I'd been left here as bait so she could get away.`
` ...Maybe she was lying about having to go to work...`
`"...You're quite the big shot, being so close to the Sonozaki daughters.`
` Maybe I should rethink how I talk to you, too. Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`Ooishi-san put a coin into a vending machine as he said something a bit appalling.`
`"Is iced tea okay with you?`
` Do you want milk in it?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Oh... no, I—"`
`"I'll put some in then, all right?`
` Here you are."`
`He handed me a cup of tea, filled to the brim with ice, as I looked on absent-mindedly.`
`...I don't think I'm obligated to have a guy like this buy me a drink, but...`
` He did get it for me, so I'll thank him.`
`Was Ooishi-san just killing time? We didn't know each other well, but he still engaged me in conversation about all sorts of dumb things.`
`...When I thought back to how I talked with Shion, this seemed like a total disaster...`
`"Maebara-san, how much do you know about Sonozaki-san?"`
`"...Other than what I heard just now, nothing."`
`Until then, I hadn't known anything about either Mion or Shion other than the fact that they were interesting.`
` I really did only just learn that she was the daughter of some prestigious family.`
`"The Sonozakis are a yakuza group with this entire region under their thumb.`
` Plus, her father is a high-ranked executive in the ×× yakuza association.`
`Did you know that?"`
`"What...?`
` An executive...?"`
`"Have you ever seen where Shion-san lives?`
`It's the very picture of a gang boss's house, protected by high walls, barbed-wire fence, and security cameras.`
` If you have the chance, you should go and visit her."`
`"............"`
`She'd mentioned Mion being a successor...... but... to a yakuza group...?`
`"No, no, no, no, no.`
` Not at all, not at all.`
` A boring old yakuza group isn't the only thing Mion Sonozaki-san will inherit.`
` She's inheriting the Sonozaki family itself. `
`...I'll leave it to you to mull over what exactly that means."`
`Ooishi-san had spoken lightly about all this from start to finish, but what he was saying wasn't light in the least... it was abrupt and unbelievable.`
`"If Mion-san wanted to, she could kill someone in the middle of the street and still cover it up.`
` Not only would witnesses not show up, but she'd put pressure on the police, too."`
`"M-Mion would never kill someone...!"`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha... She wouldn't, she wouldn't. I'm just speaking hypothetically."`
`"...Umm... Your name, it was...`
` Ooishi-san, right?"`
`"Yes, that's right."`
`"Then, Ooishi-san.`
` ...Whatever family Mion comes from, it doesn't change the fact that she's the best friend I could ever have, and I'm proud of that.`
` I don't appreciate people speaking ill of her."`
`I let my quiet anger show through in my gaze as I stared at him.`
`...Of course, I could never seem to tell what he's thinking, so I didn't know if it had any effect.`
`"Then let me be frank.`
` ...If Mion-san was suspected of a handful of incidents, what would you think?"`
`Suspected? Incidents?!`
`You can't just say terrible stuff like that on a whim!`
`"Then it would be a misunderstanding, of course!`
` Mion may say some dangerous things... but she's not the kind of person who would do something so awful!!"`
`"Maebara-san, keep your voice down...`
` We're in a library."`
`Ooishi-san shushed me, but in a state of heightened excitement as I was, I wouldn't be calmed so easily.`
`"...Please, calm down.`
` As I said before, the Sonozaki family holds a lot of power in this region, for better or worse.`
` So if anything happens, they would immediately be suspect. `
`...I'd appreciate it if you understood that."`
`...Well... I know what Ooishi-san is trying to say.`
`Combining it with what Shion told me before, the Sonozaki family is huge, and controls everything from Hinamizawa to Okinomiya.`
`Mion, meanwhile, is its successor, who apparently holds strong influence over the entire family.`
`Still... that's all? That's the only reason they're suspecting her?!`
`"I'm just doing my job, here.`
` Not to doubt Mion-san of anything, but to clear up suspicions surrounding her... Please think of it like that."`
`...He could talk a dog out of a meat truck.`
`He was the definition of a shrewd, unfair adult.`
`At this point, I began to think...`
` ...that it was no coincidence I'd met him.`
`"...Ooishi-san, do you need something from me?"`
`"Yes, I do.`
` Keiichi Maebara-san."`
`...he answered in an absent tone of voice.`
`"...Mion's being suspected of something, and you came to hear from a friend of hers: me.`
` ...Is that it?"`
`"No, no, that isn't it.`
` I didn't come to talk to a friend of Mion Sonozaki-san. I came here to talk to Keiichi Maebara-san.`
` It would probably have bothered you had I visited your house."`
`"To me...?`
` What do the police want with me...?"`
`Having realized this faked coincidental meeting had me as its target, my mood immediately turned foul.`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha.`
` You don't need to be so tense.`
` Calm down, and just answer a few questions."`
`"Am I... being questioned...?"`
`"Let's call it a chat with a guy you happened to run into. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`Ooishi-san freely suggested that I relax.`
`...That said, behind his eyes was a light, which I could only see sometimes, that was sharp as a hawk.`
`If I tried in vain to run away, he might actually take me in and bring me to an interrogation room or something.`
` ...That was an undoubtedly unpleasant thought.`
`"...You had a roaring good time at the Watanagashi Festival last night, didn't you?"`
`"Don't beat around the bush, please...!`
` I can't do small talk right now..."`
`"Last night, during the festival.`
` ...Did you see Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san?"`
`......Gulp.`
`I could plainly feel myself give a start.`
`"Hmm? ...Where did I put those pictures?`
` ...Oh.`
` Here they are."`
`He opened a small notebook and removed two photographs.`
` ...I didn't have to look.`
`"I... Well...`
` Who knows?`
` I might have seen them around, I don't remember..."`
`I was asked the same question for the second time today.`
` ...I gave the same answer for the second time, too.`
`"Hm? Your memories are blurry?`
` You couldn't have possibly been drinking or anything? Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`Here, too... I got the same answer as I had from Mion.`
`...I realized he wasn't taking my vague reply well...`
`Why... is he asking me... the same thing Mion did...?`
`The dark feelings I had nearly forgotten due to my conversation with Shion came rushing back in a hurry.`
`......We snuck into the sacred ritual storehouse—a punishable act.`
`...It was on a tiny impulse...`
` While it may not count for much now... I do feel sorry about it...`
`"I'll ask you again.`
` ...Did you see Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san at the festival last night?"`
`His tone was soft... but there was a dreadfulness in his voice, clearly different from the first time he asked.`
` ......I'm scared.`
` That was exactly how I felt...`
`"...Er...`
` Even if you repeat the question...`
` m-my answer won't change..."`
`I don't really remember.`
`...There wasn't any better answer I could give him.`
`I didn't have the balls to say I didn't see them... nor the courage to admit I had.`
`"I see.`
` ...I just thought that maybe I'd get a different answer if I asked a second time."`
`I'm too scared... to look Ooishi-san in the eyes.`
`"I'll change the question.`
` ...Come, Maebara-san.`
` Relax, relax."`
`Ooishi-san grabbed my shoulders and squeezed them, as if trying to give me a massage.`
` ...It mostly just hurt, though.`
`Still...... why... would he ask the same things as Mion?`
`...If he's asking the same things, then the next question must be...`
`"On the same night of the festival,`
` did you see Shion Sonozaki-san?"`
`......*clatter* *clatter* *clatter*`
`...I wondered what that sound was, and when I looked down, I saw that it was the unmelted ice in the cup I was gripping in my hands.`
`...My hands were trembling, rocking the ice back and forth.`
`...Realizing that, I hastily put the remaining ice in my mouth and crunched down on it.`
`"...S... Sorry...`
` I may have seen her... but... well, you know, she looks just like Mion...`
` ...I might have just mistaken the two..."`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha.`
` ...But that can't be."`
`Suddenly, Ooishi-san grabbed both my shoulders and hunched down to give me a level stare.`
`...This must be what it's like... to be a deer in the headlights.`
`I want to look away... but I can't...`
`This is the first time I've experienced... such a piercing stare...`
`"Mion-san and Shion-san wear completely different clothing.`
` You wouldn't mistake the two so easily, I would think.`
` Maebara-san."`
`His voice was harsh.`
` ...Harsh, the same as when Mion said it.`
`I could feel my heartbeat quickening.`
`...When I realized he could feel it through the hands on my shoulders, I got even more scared.`
`...Why... why are Mion and Ooishi-san... both asking about last night...?`
`Was sneaking into that storehouse so... bad...... urgh.........`
`...I shouldn't have let Takano-san talk me into it.`
`Tomitake-san casually said to check it out, too... so...`
`...Even Shion... If she hadn't encouraged me...`
`No... I understood.`
`I was the one most at fault here.`
`I shouldn't have let my curiosity get the better of me. I shouldn't have gone into the forbidden storehouse...`
`"Ooishi-san.`
` I think that's our cue to get out of here."`
`A young man wearing a suit came into the lounge.`
`...From the way he held himself, I knew immediately that he was Ooishi-san's subordinate.`
`"Hm? Oh, so it is.`
` Closing time already?"`
`I hadn't realized it until he said something.`
`...The jingle and announcement telling patrons the library had closed had started playing without me realizing it.`
`...I was so irritated, so overwhelmed, that I couldn't even hear it.`
`"Well then, Maebara-kun.`
` We're out of time, so allow me to take my leave.`
` I'd like to talk with you more about this at your leisure, when we have more time."`
`...This isn't a joke.`
` If I never saw him again, it would be too soon...`
`Ooishi-san followed his subordinate and left the lounge behind him.`
` ...However, he spun back around.`
`"Oh, right, Maebara-san."`
`"...Wha...`
` ...What is it...?"`
`"Those two questions I asked you before.`
` ...You don't remember well enough to answer either of them, correct?"`
`"......Eh... r-right......"`
`"Just so you know...`
` ...You saw them all yesterday.`
` You were walking along, the four of you, having quite a pleasant time.`
` ...Near the stone steps.`
` I saw you with my own eyes."`
`"Ugh............"`
`...I caught my breath, and my heart seemed like it was about to stop.`
`...What a detestable person.`
`...He... he knew... and he was testing me...`
`"We'll meet again.`
` Have a good year."`
`I sat there like a rock, unmoving... until I could no longer hear the clacking sounds of their footsteps...`
