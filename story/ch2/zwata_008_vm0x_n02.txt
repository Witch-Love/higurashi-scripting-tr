`Of course, if anyone but the Furude family enters...`
` ...they bring 'impurity' into it, so absolutely no one is allowed a single step inside it.`
` ......It's a sanctuary."`
`"Unfortunately, there is no Momotarou or Superman in this fairy tale."`
`...As Takano-san explained it, those with demon blood in them periodically awaken to their instincts as 'hunters.' `
`So when this happens, it's said that they descended on the human villages looking for prey and conducted Onikakushi.`
`"Broadly speaking, it's when a demon kidnaps someone; when a person is 'demoned away.'"`
`"So on the nights when they stole away villagers...`
` this ritual became known as the 'Watanagashi.'"`
` It... certainly wasn't the sort of event lively with street stands and festive chanting.`
`...It was more of a ghastly feast... the sort which would send a shiver down your spine and chill you to the bones...!!`
`...My fun memories from just a short while earlier swirled and blurred into noise, ...as if vanishing into a sandstorm. `
`It felt like the name of the 'Watanagashi' had taken on a sticky dark, shadowy aura and was pressing down on my whole being, numbing my senses.`
` My vision had turned gray, sapped of color, and everything looked like it was spinning dizzily.`
`"Rika-chan was carrying a festival hoe.`
` ...You've probably realized it already, but that's not a hoe for plowing fields."`
` Takano-san cut off with a smirk... Did she mean to say that despite being a hoe, it actually serves as a sharp bladed tool...?`
`If it's the curse, then I wonder what kind of death it'll be this year?`
` ......It is tonight, you know.`
` The night of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
` The victim surely wasn't allowed to go peacefully.`
` On the contrary, they most likely had to watch the whole process... before finally being extinguished.`
` What... what if that was me...?`
` I couldn't even imagine it... and didn't want to, either.`
`"That's all.`
` ...Only a hundred years ago.`
` Besides.`
` It kept happening even after the beginning of the Showa period.`
` ...Like with the uproar around the post-war`
` canned flesh incident,`
` ......Oh, I apologize. `
`"......Huh?`
` Takano-san, what did you just say?`
` Canned flesh...?"`
`"Oh, Jirou-san, could you not resist seeing inside?"`
`"...Geez.`
` You won't win any Pulitzer Prizes by not stocking enough film for any occasion, you know.`
` ...I suppose that's it, then..."`
