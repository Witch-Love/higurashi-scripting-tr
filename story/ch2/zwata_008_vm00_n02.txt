`Of course, if anyone but the Furude family enters...`
` ...they bring 'impurity' into it, so absolutely no one is allowed a single step inside it.`
` ......It's a sanctuary."`
`"Unfortunately, there is no Momotarou or Superman in this fairy tale."`
`"Well, they eat people.`
` They say that every decade or so, they can't help but want to feast on human flesh.`
` The villagers can't eat other villagers... `
`So when this happens, it's said that they descended on the human villages and conducted Onikakushi."`
`"Broadly speaking, it's when a demon kidnaps someone; when a person is 'demoned away.'`
` They say that the villagers of Onigafuchi would overwhelm unfortunate human villages, in order to kidnap sacrifices."`
`In the texts, it's usually one or two people."`
`"So on the nights when they stole away villagers...`
` they would feast on their kidnapped sacrifices, which is why the nights came to be known as 'Watanagashi.'"`
`It used to be a ghastly, cannibalistic feast... held on the night the villagers had collected their unfortunate dinner."`
`"Maebara-kun, you said that Watanagashi is a ritual about purifying futons, right?`
` What do you think the futons, filled with cotton—with 'wata'—represent?"`
`"Futons are futons!!`
` They're beds!`
` They're things for sleeping in!`
` What else could they possibly represent?!"`
`I was rattling on, desperately attempting to deny the horrible festival that Takano-san was describing...`
`Deep down, however... I found myself understanding all too well what she meant.`
`Futons, stuffed with cotton.`
`If the cotton represented entrails in both pronunciation and meaning, then entrail-filled futons... would have to be humans.`
`"Rika-chan was carrying a festival hoe.`
` ...You've probably realized it already, but that's not a hoe for plowing fields.`
` ...It's a tool for dissecting human bodies."`
`"Broadly speaking, it was quite the bombastic ceremony, where they'd rip out the guts and throw them into a basin.`
` ...And then the ritual was over.`
`It's thought that afterwards, the villagers, each with a different role, dismantled the flesh piece-by-piece and feasted upon it.`
` ...Heehee."`
`"These sorts of things...`
` They're printed realistically in the literature of Germany, capital of the medical world."`
`"If you want a scarier way of looking at it, think of them as cooking utensils.`
` ...Heehee."`
`"...Look."`
`"It's probably... a chopping block.`
` I think you'd strap the sacrifice down to prep them for eating."`
`The words "chopping block" sent a jolt through my body......`
`"Burning at the stake, the famous method of execution for witches, will kill the person immediately.`
`When the body suffers extreme burns on the skin all over, the decomposition of the skin's chemical makeup produces poison-like symptoms and causes an immense shock to the victim. `
`...Though I suppose it's still very cruel—compared to the guillotine, you have to wait far longer for that to happen."`
`"Oh, and also.`
` There was a method of execution in ancient Rome where they would grill the person.`
` Just like a barbecue.`
` They would cover the person in wire netting and slowly cook them over a charcoal fire."`
`To think the memories of when I went to a day camp with my family... would come rushing back now, of all times, so vividly...`
`"...That's what it was like.`
` Apparently they wouldn't die too easily for some reason.`
`According to one source, even if they roasted one side of a person to a crisp for an entire night, they would still be conscious and able to speak fluently."`
`...That's insane... You'd grill someone the whole day... and they'd still be conscious......`
`It's said that ancient Rome, famous for their executions, thought of plenty of ways to execute someone while having the victim stay alive as long as possible...`
`"Among them...`
` there was one method where they would open the gut, pull out the intestines like sausages, pull them up with a winch, and put them on public display."`
`Shion was behind me, clinging to me.`
`...Not just because she was scared.`
` ...She was protecting her stomach...`
`"You would think someone with their intestines pulled out would die instantly, right?`
` Actually...`
` ...As long as you do it tenderly and thoroughly... `
`It's apparently possible to pull them all out while the person is still conscious."`
`I felt a sick feeling in my stomach...`
`It was like my organs were coiling up... just from Takano-san's stare...`
`"Though pulling them out with a winch was a rather... exaggerated method.`
`In a more barbaric way, they might slice open the gut, then cut the intestines out and throw them everywhere...`
` It's quite imaginable that they did dreadful things like that too, isn't it? `
`However, those being put to death are conscious.`
` ...It must be far more terrifying than painful..."`
`She spoke with pleasure, as if she had come here on a sightseeing trip.`
` ...I heard Shion gulping multiple times near my ears......`
`"Perhaps Hinamizawa—or, rather, Onigafuchi Village—did something like that for the Watanagashi Festival.`
` ......Listen.`
` If you try hard...... can't you hear it?"`
`I wanted nothing more than to not hear anything at all...`
`So why? Why only at times like these do I begin to hear things I shouldn't be able to...`
`"There are many of these sorts of bird cages among European torture devices.`
` I'm surprised to see them in Japan as well."`
`"Ke...... Kei-chan,`
` ......Is there... something in there?!`
` A person?`
` A mummy?!"`
`"Eh?! Wh-Where...?!"`
`Shion desperately pointed to one of the many human-sized bird cages hanging from the ceiling, but I couldn't tell which one she meant.`
`...Being that dark, there wasn't any way you could tell if something was there in the first place.`
`"...I don't see anything.`
` You sure you're not seeing things?"`
`"..............."`
`Shion didn't seem convinced... but without a means to confirm for ourselves, we couldn't do much but wonder.`
`If it's the curse, then I wonder what kind of death it'll be this year?`
` If it's the sacrifice... then will I be thrown into the Onigafuchi Swamp while still alive?`
` ......It is tonight, you know.`
` The night of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`"The victim was skinned while still alive, underwent all kinds of torture, and was killed brutally...`
`...The author here also thinks that even after death, the remains were divided and dissected even further—the epitome of inhumanity.`
`......I'm of the opinion that the entire 'process'`
` was performed while the person was still alive, though.`
` What do you think, Maebara-kun?"`
`...She spoke in a way intended to make me imagine even more vicious things...`
`"That's all.`
` ...Only a hundred years ago.`
` Besides.`
` It kept happening even after the beginning of the Showa period.`
` ...Like with the uproar around the post-war`
` canned flesh incident,`
` ......Oh, I apologize. `
`"......Huh?`
` Takano-san, what did you just say?`
` Canned flesh...?"`
`"Oh, Jirou-san, could you not resist seeing inside?`
` ...This is a splendid treasure trove of torture devices."`
`"...Geez.`
` You won't win any Pulitzer Prizes by not stocking enough film for any occasion, you know.`
` ...I suppose that's it, then..."`
