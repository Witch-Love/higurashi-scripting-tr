`Late that night, tensions in the police station were strained.`
`In the silence, many of the staff members' eyes shifted back and forth between the clock and their telephones, counting the seconds in that stifled atmosphere.`
`Kumagaya-kun burst in with a young guy trailing behind him.`
`"Ooishi-san, I've got the autopsy results!`
` The court physician just got here!!`
` I'm ready to go, sir!!`
` I'll head straight for Gifu!!"`
`"Kuma-chan, things have gotten a bit complicated.`
` They appear to be having a very difficult time determining who the victim is."`
`"Could they have been... dismembered...?!"`
`"Nope.`
` Cooked to a nice, light brown."`
`He spoke in sportive tones, but the meaning behind his words was heavy.`
`...The staff gave a collective sigh.`
`"All the way? Head to toe...?"`
`"Completely blackened, it seems.`
` Probably smells terrible, too.`
` What a shame it is to be Gifu-san."`
`Cooked, with no possessions.`
` Then, discarded outside the prefecture...`
`At worst, it would have taken a week for the body to be identified.`
`...The fact that they'd sniffed it out tonight was huge.`
`"Komiyama-kun and a few others are performing a thorough night raid on the dentist in Okinomiya.`
` All we can do is hope a tooth matches some medical records.`
` ...Sorry! `
`Could someone go buy me two or so boxes of ultra-mild?"`
`The young guy answered in affirmation and darted out into the hallway.`
`"...We did an excellent job finding it this year.`
` ...It could be that the people who disappeared in past years were scattered outside the prefecture like this too."`
`"Then why not bury them,`
` or sink them into the Sea of Japan, or Lake Biwa, or somewhere like that?"`
`"...Why, though?`
` ...Hasn't the pattern so far been one person dies, and another disappears?"`
`"Kuma-chan, the corpse was inside an oil drum, unrestrained, and cooked.`
` They probably burned them after strangling them.`
` They knew it would be found."`
`"So what you mean is... from the beginning, they didn't want a person to disappear this year?"`
`"Not so much that as they just aren't related.`
` The person didn't disappear—in fact, whoever did it seems to have wanted to make a show of it."`
`"You mean... it could be a warning?"`
`He folded his arms... and then heaved a long and heavy sigh.`
`"That might have been the case had it happened in town.`
`...If they'd messed up, taking the victim far away and burning them alive wouldn't have been noticed.`
` If they meant it as a warning, they should have done it closer to Hinamizawa.`
`...They wanted to emphasize the fact that they killed the victim, but instead of doing it somewhere for dramatic effect, they did it outside the prefecture.`
` Did they want to emphasize it or hide it? `
`......Boy, I do wonder what Oyashiro-sama is up to this year~"`
`A telephone ring cut through the heavy silence.`
` A staff member nearby snatched up the receiver.`
`"Ooishi-san!`
` It's Komiyama!!`
` They have it!`
` The dental clinic in Okinomiya fixed the wisdom tooth three years ago!!"`
`"What about the records?!"`
`"Complete with X-rays!"`
`"Well... I feel bad for waking up the dentist before dawn.`
` Kuma-chan, get out there as soon as you get the records from Komiyama-kun."`
`"Will do!!"`
`"Oh, it's the Chief!!`
` Thank you for coming out at this hour!"`
`"Ooishi-san, my apologies for my lateness.`
` What's the situation?!"`
`"Hmm... Well, it's just getting good, you see.`
` We're all getting fired up!`
` Waa~o♪!!"`
