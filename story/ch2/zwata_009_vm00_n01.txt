`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And well... I had a bit."`
`A bit.`
`She made a gesture like she was tilting a cup into her mouth.`
` ...Which means you didn't have a cold or anything...`
`"A-Are you hung over?!`
` How old are you?!!"`
`...I suppose she'd be feeling lousy either way.`
` Still, you treat colds and hangovers in completely different ways.`
`...She didn't seem to be feeling well, but now that I knew it was a hangover, I didn't need to worry too much.`
` It would go away with time, after all.`
`...The older sister had a hangover today, but the younger made no reference to it.`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be sleeping in today with a hangover, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` Mion had a hangover?`
` Ah-hahahaha! That's so like her~~!"`
`Shion seemed a little unsteady too.`
` ...She was drinking with Mion last night, wasn't she?`
`"...Mion, how is your cold doing?`
