`"Yes. The postal worker hasn't seen anything either.`
` ...The Sonozaki main house has their seal hanging from their mailbox so that anyone can stamp their mail or parcels with it and drop it in."`
`"Na-ha-ha, that's rather careless of them.`
` ...So when was she last seen?"`
`"She was last seen at the Watanagashi opening ceremony greetings.`
` She apparently returned home right after that."`
`"Well, she is pretty old.`
` ...From what I've heard, she goes out a few times a week to take lessons, right?`
` Have you found anything out about that?"`
`"Every Monday she goes to the assembly hall to practice the taishougoto, but she didn't go this week."`
`"Any calls to say she wasn't going to be there?`
` Has anyone confirmed it?"`
`"No, nobody.`
` She apparently takes days off once in a while, though, so no one thought it was strange."`
`"Tomorrow, why don't we pretend we're the town hall and call around ten o'clock?`
` Please figure out whether she's at home."`
`"Ten o'clock? Got it!"`
`Ever since it started to seem more and more like ancient Hinamizawa traditions had something to do with all this, he'd been keeping a careful eye on the Three Families.`
`At this point, the leader of the Kimiyoshi family and the leader of the Furude family had disappeared.`
`There was only one leader left.`
`Oryou Sonozaki, the leader of the Sonozaki family.`
`She was apparently a pretty old woman.`
`Her dignity hasn't waned, but she still only appeared before people rarely, so it was difficult to confirm where she was at any given time.`
`...She, the last leader, hadn't been seen since the day of Watanagashi.`
`Was she still alive and well within the Sonozaki main house?`
` ...Or had she...?`
`"According to Mion Sonozaki, she had fallen ill and was sleeping it off."`
`"I wonder if she's really sleeping.`
` I'd like to take a look at her faceâ€”and her pulse..."`
`"............You can say that again."`
`The two of them breathed out a big puff of cigarette smoke...`
`"Ooishi-san... About the search warrants for the Sonozaki main house and the Furude shrine.`
` Do you think we'll get them?"`
`Ooishi didn't respond, exhaled another cloud of tobacco smoke, his surroundings now as foggy as his mind...`
