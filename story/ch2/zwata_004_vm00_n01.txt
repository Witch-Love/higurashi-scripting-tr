`"Rika-chan is a shrine maiden for the Watanagashi, so she has to perform a ritual dance.`
` It's practice for that."`
`"...Why don't you explain things in order?`
` First of all, what is this Watanagashi?`
` Next, what do you mean by shrine maiden?`
` Last, what do you mean by ritual dance?"`
`Come to think of it, I have a feeling Mom did say something about it during dinner the other day.`
`"The Watanagashi is a festival that happens at the shrine on a Sunday every June.`
` It's very lively!"`
`"I see.`
` But 'Watanagashi' sounds like a pretty strange name for it.`
` ...Is it something like...`
` the lantern festival, where they have a memorial for the dead by floating things down the river?"`
`"The cotton, you see, is from futons or jackets.`
` So it'd be something like a futon memorial?`
` ...They also pile futons up on the altar."`
`"I've heard of people leaving offerings of things like needles or kitchen knives to their ancestors or to casualties of war...`
` But an offering of futons is a first for me.`
` What's the history behind that?"`
`"Ye fookin biiiiitch!!`
` I'll fookin bash yer ead in!!"`
`*grumble*"`
`"More importantly, just now...`
` Were you surprised?`
` When everybody kept on showing up."`
