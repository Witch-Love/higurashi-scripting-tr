`The ritual storehouse.`
`It was a building with a strange air about it that stood quietly within the Furude shrine, surrounded by the noise of crying cicadas.`
`The storehouse was said to contain the many important ritual tools used to perform the Watanagashi ceremony, the most ghastly of rituals in all of Hinamizawa's legends.`
`So naturally, only members of the Furude family were allowed inside, or if extra hands were needed for a special ritual, then members of the three families were allowed as well.`
`Which all meant...`
` ...that the routine cleaning had to be done solely by Rika, the only remaining member of the Furude family.`
`Today was one such cleaning day.`
`Rika hated putting in effort, and since no one was around to see, she let her disgust show plainly on her face as she headed for the ritual storehouse.`
`"We only use the ritual storehouse a few times a year, so why does it have to be cleaned so often?"`
`"Au, auu!`
` That's disrespectful toward Oyashiro-sama!"`
`"Uwah.`
` What, you were here?`
` If you're here, then clean it yourself."`
`"I can't do that.`
` It's been the rule since ancient times that in every generation the cleaning has to be done by the priestesses of the Furude family."`
`"Still, I am no demon.`
` If you offered me some cream puffs, then I could make a special allowance for today."`
`"Snap.`
` Hearing you say that makes me want to clean every inch thoroughly and deny you cream puffs out of spite..."`
`"You're such a contrarian.`
` If you live your life like that, you'll definitely suffer in the long run.`
` Au.`
` Wait.`
` That wasn't what I came here to tell you!"`
`"Rika.`
` You don't have to clean the ritual storehouse today."`
`"Huh?`
` After calling me disrespectful and contrarian?"`
`"Also, I'll be a little busy today.`
` There's been a bit of trouble.`
` I'll be preoccupied with that today, so I won't have time to entertain you."`
`Hanyuu faded away, having grated against Rika's nerves.`
`"...That's irritating.`
` Hearing her say all that makes me want to thoroughly clean every corner and wax it all as well.`
` I guess I'll get it finished quickly. `
`I'm planning to go play at the pool with everyone from club this afternoon."`
`Hearing Hanyuu say she didn't have to clean today made Rika want to do it more, so she entered the ritual storehouse and spread out her cleaning tools.`
`Now, where to start?`
`First she'd brush away the dust built up on the creepy torture devices - that is, the ritual tools.`
`"......?"`
`There were several unfamiliar pouches there...`
` resting atop the ritual tools like they were being enshrined.`
`They were like bags for gym clothes, but they clearly hadn't been around the last time Rika went in here.`
`"What are these?`
` ...I wonder if they're some strange magic treasure sealed away in the ritual storehouse?"`
`Rika took one without hesitation and opened it.`
`Folded up inside was a swimsuit and something resembling a small, ancient scroll...`
`The voices of children playing around reached some distance from the Okinomiya Public Pool.`
`The club members' bicycles all flew into the pool's parking lot one after another.`
`"Aw yeah!!!`
` First one here!!!"`
`"Khhh!!!`
` I only lost by a hair!`
` But I was still here second!!!"`
`"Now hold on a moment.`
` The inquiry lamp lit up on this one!`
` Satoko, a moment ago you obstructed me!`
` That's earned you a demotion, putting me in second!"`
`"Please don't throw away your betting slips until the winning horse has been decided.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`"How do you know about that, Rika-chan? How...?"`
`"Hahahaha!`
` Still, I'm looking forward to enjoying the pool with all our club members here!`
` Will everything be okay, though? This pool won't explode or disappear, will it?"`
`"Hmm, not unless Mii-chan says we should do some fun club activity here. Right?♪"`
`"Ohh ho ho ho!`
` Well, it shouldn't expect to escape unharmed when we've come to play!"`
`"No, no. Today let's just behave and enjoy the pool.`
` They only just finished remodeling this place, and my grandma got called in as a guest when they finished work on it.`
` I can't make her look bad."`
`"I don't quite understand, but I do get that Mion will get mad if we go wild here.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`Just before they split up by gender to change in the changing rooms,`
` Rika suddenly raised her hand.`
`"I almost forgot.`
` Today I brought something a bit unusual for everyone♪"`
`"Huh?`
` What is it?`
` A beach ball?`
` Or is it a big dolphin floaty?! Is it?!"`
`"What?`
` What are those pouches?"`
`"What's this now?`
` You want us club members to wear matching swimsuits?"`
`"You'll never guess!`
` These are the secret treasures that were hidden in the ritual storehouse, the 'Irresistible Swimsuits'!"`
`"What do you mean by 'irresistible'?`
` You mean wearing them makes you popular?"`
`"...That's odd. Why do I have deja vu?`
` And why am I getting the chills...?"`
`"But look at this!`
` There's a shuper kyute swimsuit inside!`
` Ohh~ I'm taking it home~!!!"`
`"But don't you feel hesitant in wearing a swimsuit someone else chose?`
` Will it even fit?"`
`"You won't need to worry there.`
` It'll stretch to fit whoever wears it, in sizes all the way from elephant to flea. `
`Plus, whoever wears it will immediately become overflowing with charm, drawing in the opposite sex like a black hole and winning over their hearts."`
`"Well, I normally keep my charm in check.`
` But it might be good to release my limiters now and then."`
`"My, my.`
` You're suggesting all the men at the pool would end up staring at me?`
` That's mildly embarrassing, but I'd love to experience it at least once!"`
`"So in my case, the hearts of all the girls in swimsuits would be drawn to me like I'm a black hole, huh♪"`
`"I don't have one for you, Keiichi.`
` There's only four, and for women.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`Ding.`
`Keiichi trudged into the men's changing room.`
`However, he was quick to regain his spirit.`
`At the very least, he was sure to see the club members in swimsuits packed with arousing pheromones.`
`"No, wait...`
` When a weird magic item is involved, that usually leads to a disastrous end, right?"`
`"Like if it unleashes incredible charm, then it's either so incredibly tacky or embarrassing that it makes the wearer ashamed of it."`
`"That reminds me, during my irresistible swimtrunks incident,`
` the swimtrunks had the same pattern as a stereotypical thief's sack..."`
`At that moment.`
` Bright light filled the area.`
`He didn't understand what was going on, but he did realize he was caught up in something out of this world.`
`"W-What...? What is this...?"`
`"...Listen, child of man.`
` Maebara Keiichi..."`
`He heard a solemn voice coming from the light of heaven.`
`The voice was so intense he recognized it as the voice of a god.`
`"What on earth is going on here?!`
` Have I done something blasphemous...?!"`
`"You have done nothing wrong.`
` However, the priestess of the Furude Shrine, Rika, has done something absurd..."`
`"R-Rika-chan has...?`
` Wait... Are you referring to the irresistible swimsuits she brought today...?`
` I do remember her saying they were a secret treasure from the ritual storehouse..."`
`"That is precisely it.`
` ...And after I told that Rika she didn't have to clean today, too.`
` Hahh, good grief.`
` Why are the Furude women always, always such contrarians...?"`
`"So, uh, God.`
` What does this have to do with me?"`
`"Maebara Keiichi.`
` I want you to become the savior who will rescue this planet."`
`"S-Saviorrrr?!`
` I mean, every boy past a certain age has fantasized about something like that... b-but are you being serious...?"`
`"Those magic swimsuits are foreign objects that drifted here from a different Fragment.`
` It's very difficult to cross the Sea of Fragments, and it's even rarer for an object with no will of its own to do so... `
`Yet those swimsuits were blessed with a billion miracles and good fortune to make their way here to this fragment."`
`"Still, they just make people irresistible, right? Wouldn't that only be enough to create the kind of charming scenes often seen in romantic comedies?"`
`"That may be true of its power alone, but that is not the problem here."`
`Different Fragments are essentially different worlds.`
`Incidentally, that also means there are things which cannot coexist with this world, no matter how similar the two may be.`
`"Those things that drifted here are made from materials that can't exist in this Fragment.`
` Roughly one hour after those girls put them on, the reaction will begin."`
`"R-Reaction...?`
` D-Do you mean the swimsuits will start melting away...♪"`
`"The materials of this world will react to the material that shouldn't exist in it.`
` Mutual annihilation.`
` ...That reaction will create enough energy to give birth to a new galaxy."`
`"Wouldn't that mean... that the Earth's in danger?"`
`"It will cause an explosion that will easily shatter as many planets as a human could possibly count in one lifetime, and still have more energy left over."`
`"G-Geeeeeeeeeh?!?!?!"`
`Hanyuu showed him what would happen in just one hour.`
`Keiichi was shown a vision of the planet floating in space.`
` Then our blue, shining Earth...`
` exploded!!!`
`It wasn't on the kind of scale where people could flee on a spaceship.`
` The entire galaxy exploded, and it was clear there was nothing to be done about Earth at all.`
`"Hold on, hold on!!!`
` Why is something that terrifying here in Hinamizawa?!`
` And why does Rika-chan have it?!"`
`"It just happened to drift into this Fragment yesterday.`
` ...I had been planning to spend all of today safely disposing of it."`
`"Shouldn't you be telling Rika-chan directly instead of me?`
` I mean, shouldn't you be telling her right now to stop them from wearing the suits?!"`
`"The problem is that the magic power in those swimsuits also has the power to ward away the gods of this Fragment, like me.`
` So my voice can't reach Rika while she has the swimsuits with her."`
`"I-I see...!`
` So there's a strict time limit of one hour from now!`
` It just turned one o'clock, so I'll have to do something by two!"`
`"I've imbued one of the trash cans at the entrance with my power.`
` If you toss them into the trash can, then I can safely expel them from this Fragment."`
`"Roger that.`
` Which means once I strip the four club members of the world-destroying swimsuits and toss them into the trash can, my mission will be complete!"`
`Keiichi leapt out of the changing room with enthusiasm.`
`He knew it wouldn't be easy to convince them to take off the swimsuits they just put on.`
`Yet now the fate of the world, nay, the galaxy, was riding on this very thing!`
`Besides, they were friends-in-arms who faced death together and shared both joys and hardships!`
` Surely they would understand and listen!`
`"Heeey, everyone!!!`
` We have big trouble! Listen to meee!!!"`
`However, the poolside was shrouded in a strange fervor that left Keiichi taken aback...`
`"Ohhhh...!`
` ...Wo... Wow... So beautiful...!"`
`"Models? Actresses? What are such cute girls doing here at our public pool...?"`
`"Meep~♪`
` Everyone's eyes are so passionate♪"`
`Snap.`
` Rika posed like a cat and winked, causing a frenzied roar to erupt from the men.`
`"""Foooonnooooooooooh!`
` Fnnghhhoooooooooo~~~!!!"""`
`"Oh my. I will not allow you to hog all the stares, Rika.`
` Look at how charming I am!"`
`"Nnowaaaaaaah! Cuuuuute! S-Sexyyyyyyy!!!"`
` "S-S-Satoko-samaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Then we'll join you too~"`
`"Let's leave everyone weak-kneed~♪`
` Ufuun♪"`
`"Ghooooooooh!!!`
` B-B-Beautiful!!!`
` No, Big Bang!!!`
` This is a Big Bang of Beautyyyyy!!!"`
`Rena and Mion were both posing like models, leaving the men writhing and shouting with joy...`
`The swimsuits themselves certainly were cute.`
` It was hard to imagine they were foreign objects that had drifted in from another world.`
`However, the waves of charm pouring off of them were truly otherworldly!`
`"Foooooonnnhoooooh!`
` You're all super sexyyyyyy...! Aah... ah...!"`
`"Huh?!`
` S-Stay cool, Maebara Keiichi!`
` ...That truly is incredible magic!`
` They certainly live up to the name of 'irresistible swimsuit'...!"`
`Because Keiichi knew of the threat and was entrusted with the fate of the galaxy, he just barely held onto his reasoning.`
`However, the rest of the other men were thoroughly unable to resist their charm.`
`No, it was violence.`
` Violence under the name of charm.`
` True violence, known as sexiness, which none born male could resist!`
`The overpowered men were currently an enthralled procession following around the sexy charm of the club members.`
`Yet they weren't the only ones enraptured.`
` The club members themselves were as well.`
`Dazzling, handsome poolside princes were reverently treating them like princesses.`
`This was the dream!`
` The maiden's dream!!!`
` The dream every young girl admired in shoujo manga and gave up on as impossible!`
`"Incredible... I don't think I want to go back to reality when I'm this popular. I don't think so at all...♪"`
`"Rika-chan... These swimsuits really are amazing...`
` I might get addicted to this...♪"`
`"Seeing men's attitudes change so drastically is a tad off-putting...`
` but I, for one, feel amazing! Oooh ho ho ho ho!"`
`"Oh, it's Keiichi♪`
` You can be enraptured by our charm as well, Keiichi♪"`
`Rika gave him an adorable cat pose.`
`If the waves of charm were visible, it would have been like witnessing the explosive shockwave from a huge comet over 10 km wide!`
`Keiichi managed to endure as the minds of the men around them were torn into pieces...!`
`"H-H-Hold on a second...`
` Be careful how you act...!`
` R-Right now every minor movement of yours holds enough impact to wipe out the dinosaurs...!!"`
`"Oh come on, Kei-chan, you're exaggerating~`
` Like this? Like this?`
` Ufuun, ahaan♪"`
`"""PHooooooooooooh!!!`
` Nnoooooooooooooooooooooooooogyaooooooooooooh!!!"""`
`"Mii-chan, stop it.`
` Keiichi-kun is suffering...♪"`
`"Rena! Thank you for your consideration!`
` But less!`
` Less pressing your breasts together, please!!!`
` I know you're not doing it intentionally!`
` B-But... i-it's very effective...!!!"`
`"My, my, I wonder what would happen if I pressed my modest-yet-still-growing-for-my-age breasts together?"`
`"S-Stop, Satoko!`
` ...No... Ggnooooooooooooooooh!!!"`
`"Then I'll try pressing my budding and underdeveloped breasts together.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`S-Stoooooooooooooooooooooooop...! Oooooh.... oooooh.....!!!!`
`The men's minds were hit by several big bangs...`
`Visually, it looked like the men had developed pink hearts in their eyes and grew unsteady on their feet.`
`However, in the men's collected mental world... the planetary alignment was wrecked by clashing galaxies shattered into pieces until all that remained was spasibo...`
`Still, the club members were completely unaware of the destruction they wrought.`
`No, no!`
` If it was just exploding the minds of men, that would still be cute!`
` But five whole minutes had already passed!`
` There was only 55 minutes left before the whole galaxy exploded!`
`"Hey, timeout, timeout!!!`
` Everyone, please listen to me!`
` This is extremely important!`
` The irresistible swimsuits you're all wearing right now are dangerous! `
`At this rate, the Earth will be destroyed, so please take them off quickly!!!"`
`"My, asking us to remove our swimsuits? Keiichi-san, that's not something you should be saying to a lady."`
`"""Ghaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahn♪♪♪"""`
`"These swimsuits will destroy the Earth...?`
` I don't have any idea what you're talking about.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`"""Offhhhhhhhhhhnnn♪♪♪"""`
`"What on earth do you mean?`
` Let's hear Keiichi-kun out."`
`"No, no♪ He's just jealous of how popular we've become.`
` Today he can enjoy having his mind blown away by our charm~♪"`
`"""Hooooooooooooooooh, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!`
` M-Mion-shamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan♪♪♪"""`
`"Dammit, they've gotten too carried away to listen!`
` I have no other choice now!`
` If they won't listen to reason, I'll have to use force!!!"`
`Keiichi boldly leapt at them!`
`However, the men surrounding the girls wouldn't allow such barbarism...!`
`The men seized upon the opportunity to show off how cool they were and leapt at Keiichi like animals...!!!`
`Smack, bam!!! Kathump, kabam!`
`...The outcome was plain as day.`
`The club members left with roaring laughter and the enraptured men followed them like a procession once again.`
`Keiichi was left behind, having been torn into pieces...`
`"...R-Right...`
` I wouldn't be having trouble if I could challenge them head on and win..."`
`What will you do, Maebara Keiichi...?!`
`While you're sitting there lost in thought, time is still slipping away.`
` The end of the world (and also the galaxy) is drawing closer!`
`"I don't stand a chance of winning if I challenge them directly, without tricks.`
` ...I have to drag them into a situation where I can beat them on my own!"`
`"Divide and conquer would be a standard tactic.`
` Challenging them head on is just plain foolish. `
`...So, I'll have to maneuver them around, isolate them one by one, catch them off guard, and then attack to seize victory!"`
`"Alright, let's run a mental simulation.`
` ...First, I'll call Rena out by herself to a place without anyone else around..."`
`I'll lure Rena out to a storeroom in the staff building, which the general public avoids...`
`We'll still hear the cheery voices from the pool, but Rena will be confused by the desolate space devoid of others.`
`Then I'll leap from the shadows and assault Rena from behind!`
`"Kyaaaaaaaah?!?!`
` K-Keiichi-kun?!"`
`"Whoa there, Rena.`
` Sorry, but be good for me, okay? It'll all be over soon..."`
`Then I'll pin Rena against the floor in her swimsuit.`
`I'll straddle her, and use my left hand to pin her hands above her head.`
`Then I'll use my free right hand... to reach for her chest...`
`"Kyaaaaaah, stoooooop! Someone help meeeeeee!!!"`
`"Heh heh heh~`
` You can cry and scream, but no one is coming to rescue you...♪"`
`"Uaaaaaaaaah!!!`
` No, no! I definitely can't do that!!!"`
`He scratched at his head, trying to dispel his overactive imagination.`
`Even if it was to save the galaxy, his pride as a man wouldn't allow him to force himself upon a swimsuit-clad girl in an isolated area!!!`
`"No, no!`
` There's no honor in fighting like that!`
` ...Not to mention, it's already impossible for a guy like me to forcibly strip a swimsuit from a girl! `
`Though what else can I do now that it's proving difficult to convince them to strip on their own...?"`
`If this was a serious club competition, then he would be prepared to stoop to any low to win... but they were currently in Okinomiya at a public pool with mostly normal people.`
`Even if the club members would freely forgive him, the other people around wouldn't feel the same way.`
`By tomorrow there wouldn't be a single person in Okinomiya or Hinamizawa that didn't hear the rumors of him being a pervert who assaulted women and tried to strip them naked!`
`"...They have the numerical advantage and I'm also handicapped by being a guy... Damn, what am I supposed to do?!"`
`That was when an unusual figure crossed Keiichi's vision.`
`It was Shion.`
`Judging from her outfit, she was working at the public pool's food court.`
`She was definitely planning to enjoy the pool herself as soon as her shift was over.`
` She was wearing the restaurant's apron over her swimsuit, and was standing a bit further back, in the shadows.`
`She was also chewing on her thumbnail with a terrifying expression as she stared at the irresistible club members.`
`...Apparently she didn't like her twin, Mion, being so popular.`
`"It'll be reassuring if I can get Shion on my side!`
` Her wit and courage are on par with that of the club members!`
` On top of that, she's a girl, so it'll be easier for her to touch a girl's body!"`
`"Ggggggnn...!!!`
` W-Why is Mion this populaaaar?!`
` And yet no one is even looking at meeee!`
` Grrrrrrr!!!"`
`"Calm down, Shion.`
` You'll bite through your thumbnail..."`
`"Hyaah?!?!`
` Kei-chan, when did you get here?!?!"`
`"I've been here a while.`
` ...We're short on time though.`
` For now, just listen to me!"`
`"I see.`
` Got it.`
` ...Sheesh, Sis is such a huge idiot.`
` She's getting so full of herself when she's only popular due to magic! `
`Add in the fact the galaxy will be destroyed if nothing is done in 40 minutes, and it's no laughing matter!"`
`Shion was quick to understand.`
` ...Though it was more like after learning the truth behind Mion's popularity, she was more than happy to help strip it away from her.`
`As an only child, Keiichi didn't really get it, but he assumed being siblings came with all kinds of difficult feelings like that.`
`"Anyway, let's isolate them one by one and recover those swimsuits.`
` I'll do the stripping, so don't worry.`
` You'd get arrested in a flash if you did it anyway."`
`"Alright!`
` Having an ally is reassuring!`
` Now let's start making our move.`
` Who should we target first?!"`
`"Let's target Satoko first.`
` The longer we leave that girl alone the more traps she'll set, which will make things more difficult."`
`"Alright!`
` Our first target is Satoko!`
` Satoko's irresistible swimsuit!`
` Let's strip it off of her!!!"`
`In the next moment...`
` An eagle-shaped shadow blocked the sun that had been lighting up Keiichi and Shion.`
`No, not a shadow.`
` A person with a cloak? No!`
` A man with a lab coat fluttering behind him landed before the pair!`
` It was Irie Kyousuke!!!`
`"Hey.`
` I heard what's going on. If it's to protect the galaxy, then I, Irie Kyousuke!`
` Will happily offer up my life to strip off Satoko-chan's swimsuit!!!"`
`"I-Iri!!!`
` Nevermind where you were or how you heard our story!`
` Having even one more ally right now is a big help!"`
`"I doubt he meant it about protecting the galaxy though.`
` Still, he'll be useful as a distraction."`
`At that time...`
` the club members were conveniently taking separate actions.`
`It seemed the men following them each had different tastes, so they were each surrounding their favorite girl.`
`That naturally helped to separate the four of them.`
`Satoko was enjoying her popularity at first, but she was finally starting to grow annoyed by it, so now she was trying to avoid attention and rest on a deck chair.`
`Of course, Irie wasn't one to miss that golden opportunity.`
`"Satoko-chaaaaan!!!`
` Toooh!!!"`
`"Hyaaaah?!?!`
` C-C-Coach?!`
` When and where on earth did you pop out of?!"`
`"So long as the sun shines,`
` whenever you're in a crisis, Satoko-chan, I, Irie Kyousuke, will always appear!"`
`"Crisis? Coach....`
` I'm not in a crisis, I'm actually feeling quite great.`
` In fact, I never thought I'd be so popular-"`
`"Yes!`
` That swimsuit is a danger!`
` It's putting you in a crisis!"`
`"W-W-What do you mean...?!"`
`"...Still.`
` This whole story about that magic swimsuit exploding the galaxy in a few dozen minutes...`
` Do you think Satoko will believe it...?"`
`"It might not be very convincing.`
` ...Though I think Coach has his own unique way of doing it."`
`"His own unique way? ...Right.`
` Coach is a doctor!"`
`"Yes.`
` Coach is a doctor as his side business.`
` If he uses his skill as a doctor, I'm sure Satoko will believe him."`
`"...Of course, his main job is maid evangelism."`
`"Ehhh?!`
` This swimsuit... is bad for my skin?"`
`"Yes.`
` Unfortunately I've discovered that it contains base materials which cause an allergic reaction in the skin of a select few!"`
`"Satoko-chan.`
` Have you ever had a mosquito bite turn red, swell up, and become itchy?`
` Have you ever felt ticklish when someone waved a feather against you?!"`
`"I-I have..."`
`"I knew it!`
` Your body is one of those that are allergic to the swimsuit's materials!`
` It's not too late yet!`
` You should go change into a different swimsuit at once!"`
`Way to go, Iri.`
` He was being a little suspicious, but his medical explanation was steadily convincing Satoko.`
`"A-Alright.`
` I already had enough fun being popular anyway.`
` Plus I brought my own swimsuit, too.`
` I'll go get changed in the changing room."`
`"No, no!`
` Your skin is already in the highly dangerous red zone!`
` You haven't started showing symptoms yet, but you need treatment!"`
`"I thought something like this might happen, so I always carry a swimsuit that's great for your skin!!!`
` Of course I keep all sizes, from those for young bodies to those for seductive, outrageous proportions!!! `
`I highly recommend you wear this English maid style swimsuit made from the healthiest of fabrics!!!"`
`Uwaaaaaaah! How could heeeeee?!!!`
` Satoko was finally in agreement and he ruined it in an instant!!!`
`The very next moment, there was a shocking flash of light, and Coach lay sprawled out with a burnt smell rising from him.`
`Shion had used her trump card - her max-output stun gun.`
`"Hahh.`
` I figured it would end up like this anyways...`
` Hellolo~ Satoko.`
` It's your Nee-nee~"`
`"M-My, Shion-san.`
` When did you-..."`
`Crackle!!!`
` Satoko also collapsed following a comical electric shock.`
`"H-Hey.`
` That was merciless...`
` Here, a towel."`
`"Thank you.`
` Now if you're a gentleman, could you please turn around for a moment?"`
`Shion took the bath towel that was handed to her and covered Satoko up with it before quickly stripping her of the swimsuit.`
`Rustle, rustle.`
` Shhpop!`
`"One down!`
` So what do we do with the swimsuit we removed?"`
`"Chuck it into the magic trash can by the entrance!"`
`They both raced for the entrance and tossed the swimsuit into the trash can Hanyuu had imbued with her magic.`
`Then it shimmered with light as it disintegrated, almost as if it was returning to heaven.`
`"Now we've finally cleared the first hurdle.`
` How much time left?"`
`"Only about thirty minutes!"`
`"Let's waste no time in moving on to the next one.`
` Now, who should we target next?"`
`"Mion.`
` If we don't go after her before she hears about what we're doing, we'll be in trouble."`
`Irie carried the unconscious Satoko over to the doctor's office.`
`Mion and the others were still most likely unaware of the attack.`
`"Roger that.`
` We go after Sis next.`
` I'll approach her, wait until her guard is down, and knock her out with my stun gun. `
`Then we'll pretend she had a fainting spell, and you and I will carry her somewhere out of the way."`
`"Got it!`
` You really are a big help, Shion!`
` ...Though it feels like you could handle everyone all on your own somehow..."`
`Keiichi thought he would be the hero saving the galaxy, but now he realized he had been relegated to the status of "side character" and it left him feeling a little blue.`
`However, this was no time to be worrying about that.`
`They only had a little time left!`
`Mion had also been enjoying her popularity, but she was starting to want some alone time as well.`
`It wasn't that difficult to send her followers away.`
`She just had to say she was going to the bathroom, and the men couldn't follow after her.`
`Mion stood before the sink's mirror in the bathroom, grinning at her own reflection.`
`"They say women grow more beautiful the more they're seen.`
` ...I certainly think I can see that now!"`
`"I definitely feel like I'm even more irresistible now than when I first put the swimsuit on.`
` ...Hmm, will I have to give this swimsuit back to her?`
` I hope I can wear it forever."`
`"...That reminds me, I wonder if Kei-chan is feeling jealous?`
` Kei-chan, our bonds as club members will never change. `
`But if you're going to take the next step, then I hope you'll use that jealousy to give you courage.`
` ...Mmmn, what am I standing here saying?!`
` Hmm, so embarrassing, Heeheehee!"`
`"...What are you creepily grinning in front of a mirror for, Sis?"`
`"Huh? Ah?!`
` Shion?!`
` You startled me!!!`
` What are you doing here?"`
`"Angel Mort currently has a pop-up shop at the food court here at the Okinomiya Public Pool."`
`"Ohh yeah, that's right.`
` Thanks for working all the way out here.`
` Have fun earning that cash, okay?`
` I'm busy getting all the guys to stare at me.`
` Ufu, mfufufufu...!!!"`
`She spoke with a loose, sloppy smile.`
` Her guard was completely down.`
`Keiichi was standing by just outside the bathroom.`
` Once Shion hit her with the stun gun, the two of them would pretend she fainted and carry her somewhere out of sight to relieve her of the swimsuit.`
`"Good grief.`
` Keep making a face like that and your cheeks will sag.`
` If you end up looking that dumb, then we won't be identical twins anymore."`
`"That's not true.`
` Besides, a little sagging would just make me look more like you."`
`Mion and Shion were having their usual silly banter.`
`Yet Shion's right arm slowly...`
` advanced from Mion's blindspot. Only her arm moved, like it had a life of its own, bringing the stun gun closer...`
`Then in a blink, only slightly faster... Mion's own arm moved like it was alive and pulled her big model gun out from somewhere and pressed it against Shion's forehead.`
`From their expressions, they both looked like they were chatting, but their arms were acting separately.`
`"Huh? What?`
` What's this now?"`
`"Uhh... Ahahahaha..."`
`"I've heard you modified that stun gun quite a bit.`
` Though you should know this piece of mine is quite modified too.`
` It can pierce right through aluminum cans."`
`"Well, even if I'm joking about that, it'll still leave a bruise on your forehead for a long time.`
` Long enough that you might get nicknamed The Buddha~."`
`"Oh dear. Stop with that, Sis. You're so scary~♪"`
`She played it off, but her brow was twitching.`
`They really were twins.`
` They could sense the other's hostility.`
`"You wanted to try wearing this irresistible swimsuit, right?`
` But you can't♪ I won't let you wear it♪"`
`"Of course~~~♪`
` Well, Sis, I should be heading back to work now~♪"`
`"Work hard~♪`
` Give Uncle Yoshiro my regards~♪"`
`"Khhhhhhhhhh!!!`
` Sis! I can't believe Sis got one over on me!!!`
` It's not fair!!!"`
`"Seriously? Your surprise attack didn't work...?`
` And now that you failed, Mion is in alert mode too...`
` This is bad... How will we ever go after her again...?"`
`"No.`
` We still have options.`
` You're up next, Kei-chan."`
`"Come on.`
` If your surprise attack won't work, then how am I supposed to catch her off guard?!"`
`"No, no.`
` We'll still catch her off guard, but you'll be doing it from a different angle that only you can pull off."`
`I'll teach you my secret plan, Keiichi.`
`I'm 50/50 on whether or not it'll actually work, but it's the only option we have in order to save the galaxy!`
`"Huh? It's Kei-chan!`
` Hey!"`
`"Hey, Mion.`
` ...Looks like you're enjoying your popularity."`
`"Hmm? Huh?`
` What's the matter?`
` You seem kind of down.`
` Are you a bit jealous this old man is so popular?"`
`"I-I'm not jealous..."`
`"Ufufufufufu!!!`
` You are, you are!"`
`"I was just thinking how... none of these guys understand your true charm."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"They're all just seduced by the irresistible swimsuit's magic... None of those guys have noticed your true charm. `
`...Even though I know how charming you are, no one else gets it. And that's just frustrating and sad, to me."`
`"...Kei-chan..."`
`"I know how charming you truly are.`
` If the other men saw that too and were moved by it, then I wouldn't be jealous.`
` In fact, as your best friend, I'd be proud."`
`"So.`
` I wish you would show those followers your true charms.`
` And I wish you'd realize it too."`
`"Huh?`
` Me...?"`
`"You're always putting yourself down by saying things like this 'old man isn't very feminine' and all.`
` ...But you're full of a cute young woman's charm, if you ask me."`
`"I was always proud that I was the only one who noticed it.`
` But now I feel the opposite.`
` ...I want those followers to see your true charms."`
`"Kei... ...Kei-chan..."`
`Hey, Shion!!!`
` Is this really the right thing to do?!`
` If Mion finds out this was just a strategy to get the irresistible swimsuit off of her, then she'll rip me apart!`
`Well, I guess sacrificing myself is a small price compared to saving the galaxy...`
`"...My swimsuit...`
` I was thinking I might change into the one I brought... with me...`
` Though I'm not so confident.`
` ...The swimsuit I brought today... really is a boring swimsuit that's neither cute nor sexy... `
`Everyone will be disappointed.`
` ...Of course that includes you, right...?"`
`"Wear this."`
`"What's this...?"`
`"I believe this swimsuit will best bring out your charms."`
`Keiichi handed her a paper bag with the swimsuit that Shion had provided him with.`
`He had no idea what the swimsuit was like, but he lied through his teeth so he could get her to change into it, letting him recover the irresistible swimsuit.`
`"S-Sure.`
` Got it...`
` Promise not to laugh if I don't look good in it though, okay...?"`
`"Of course I won't!`
` Also, I'll take the irresistible swimsuit back to Rika-chan on your behalf, so bring it out with you."`
`"Huh?`
` W-Why do I have to give you the swimsuit I just took off...?!`
` Why, why...?`
` I-I-If you really insist, then umm... I guess it's fine..."`
`"Stop! Don't blush!`
` I'm saying this for the sake of the galaxy!!!`
` A-A-Anyway, please hurry!!!"`
`Mion went back into the women's changing room with light-headed steps.`
`"Okay, Kei-chan!`
` See? Sis was an easy mark, right?"`
`"It was easy up to this point, but I'm afraid of tomorrow.`
` You just made me trigger a tragedy flag, I know it!!!`
` Even if we save the galaxy, there's no hope of salvation for me!!!"`
`"That's just a matter of whether or not you make up your mind already."`
`"Make up my mind?!`
` About what?!!!"`
`"If you remain too dense, then you'll trigger my tragedy flag, in addition to hers."`
`"Ah, Sis!`
` Welcome back.`
` You look great in that~"`
`"Oh... Umm... What is this?`
` ...This swimsuit...???"`
`Mion came back from changing... wearing something extremely familiar, even if she did look incredibly good in it.`
`"This... is Angel Mort's uniform...`
` ...Isn't it...?"`
`"That's right, Sis♪ You look just as great in it as ever!`
` Okay, now take this out."`
`Shion quickly removed Mion's hair tie.`
`Her long hair flowed free of its former ponytail, and so now it looked like two Shions were standing there.`
`"W-What's the meaning of this...???"`
`That was when they heard Uncle Yoshiro's voice.`
` He was calling for Shion-chan.`
`"Ahh, there you are!`
` Shion-chan, sorry!`
` Can you come back from break?!`
` We got a sudden rush of customers and we can't handle them all!"`
`"Huh?!`
` H-H-Hold on!`
` I'm not Shion!`
` I'm Mion! Mion!!!"`
`"Either works for me!`
` If you're in Angel Mort's uniform, that's good enough!`
` Come on, let's go, let's go!!"`
`"Sorry, Sis.`
` We're busy saving the galaxy, so please take care of the restaurant for me♪"`
`"I'll remember this...!!!"`
`"Here.`
` Now we've safely recovered two."`
`"Alright!`
` Let's toss this in the magic trash can fast!`
` We have... Geh?! Only 15 minutes left!!!"`
`"All thanks to Sis taking her sweet time changing."`
`In the next instant!`
` The wooden hammer used to hit temple gongs came flying out of nowhere and struck Keiichi right in the back of the head!`
`While the hammer had originally been aiming for Shion, she cleanly dodged it.`
`"I found you!!!`
` Shion-san, how dare you!`
` There's no reason good enough to warrant shocking me out of the blue!!!"`
`"Satoko...!!!`
` Now, now, don't be mad.`
` Once you hear why, you'll understand it had to be done!"`
`"T-The truth is!`
` Those irresistible swimsuits you all were wearing—"`
`"Those are dangerous treasures from the Furude Shrine, right?`
` I had a revelation from God while I was passed out."`
`Once the irresistible swimsuits were removed, Hanyuu was able to make contact and explain the circumstances.`
`Thanks to her divine power, everyone could understand the situation without any confusion.`
`"I was enjoying that irresistible swimsuit, but I would, in fact, prefer to keep living in the same galaxy.`
` How many people are left?!"`
`"Two left!`
` Just Rika-chan and Rena.`
` We're down to 15 minutes remaining!"`
`"We don't have time to chat!`
` Let's hurry!`
` Come on, you two!"`
`"Who do we target next?`
` Rika-chan, right?!"`
`"If we bring Rika back to her senses, everything should fall into place.`
` Rena-san seems pretty calm and collected about the whole thing. `
`So if we make Rika understand that it's dangerous and ask her to take it off, she should give it back easily!"`
`"I don't think it'll go that quickly with Rika-chan...`
` She normally puts on an act, but she's still a cunning veteran club member."`
`"Rika-chama's absorbed the followers that stuck to Sis and Satoko,`
` so now she has a huge throng of bodyguards."`
`"Uwah...`
` Damn that Rika-chan, she's doing it on purpose, isn't she?!`
` With her repeatedly pulling off those enchanting poses, those guys' excitement is at a dangerous level!"`
`"Rika does tend to enjoy making men eat out of the palm of her hand."`
`In other words, she would be the most impregnable target of them all.`
`However, it was also highly likely that conquering Rika-chan would resolve everything all at once.`
` She was basically the final boss.`
`Even so, it was worth circumventing her and conquering Satoko and Mion first.`
`Having the trap master Satoko on their side was a big deal.`
`Plus, having Mion take her place meant the reliable Shion was freed from the bonds of hourly wage labor.`
`That also made it seem like it would be even better to conquer Rena and get her on their side first, but...`
`"We don't have time...`
` We can't afford to go slow and steady."`
`"Yes.`
` We should focus all our effort into settling the battle against Rika!"`
`"I doubt a surprise attack will work on Rika-chama."`
`"That said, I don't see how we can win just by attacking her head on!`
` Look at the hearts in the eyes of those bodyguards!`
` 'I'll die for Rika-chan!' is practically written on their faces!!!"`
`"Ho ho ho!`
` Please, Keiichi-san? No matter how many non-club members gather together against us, their numbers mean nothing before my traps."`
`This was their strategy.`
` Satoko would move in ahead of time and set up a kill zone of powerful traps.`
`Then Keiichi and Shion would launch their attack while Satoko blocked off the escape paths. Together, they'd drive Rika's followers into the kill zone, putting a stop to them.`
`They would also need additional traps to confuse the bodyguards.`
`Once she lost them, Rika would finally decide to flee in order to protect herself.`
`Satoko disappeared into the crowd for a while, then after about 5 minutes, she came back giving the all-clear sign.`
`"...Alright!`
` ...Let's go! Protect the galaxy!!!"`
`""Yeah!!!""`
`"""Rika-samaaaaa! Aaaaaah, so beautifuuuuuul...♪♪♪"""`
`"Now, Rika-san, allow us to put some sunscreen on you."`
`"No, no, why don't you join us under this parasol and enjoy some tapioca milk tea instead?"`
`"Ahh, we can't allow Rika-chan's skin to burn!`
` Now, get under my shadow."`
`"Meep~~♪`
` I feel very comfortable. It's like I've become a queen~`
` Nipah~♪"`
`"Mmr, what is it?!"`
`Pop pop pop!`
` After the sound of explosions, most of the crowd began sneezing.`
`A huge amount of Satoko's secret pepper-mix bang-snaps erupted within them.`
`The rising clouds of pepper smoke were sending the bodyguards into a sneezing hell!`
`"Attack! It's an attaaaack!!!`
` Evacuate Rika-sama to safety!!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` Satoko's traps are a diversion.`
` Strengthen our rear guard."`
`"Come on, Rika-san, hide behind us!!!"`
`As expected from Rika.`
` She didn't even flinch at such an attack.`
`However, even if Rika could issue appropriate commands, the bodyguards following her were just amateurs!`
`"Let's go, Shion!!!`
` Doryaaaaaaah!!!"`
`"Yes! Roger that!!!`
` Take thaaaaat!!!"`
`"""Owah?!`
` Uwaaaaah!!!"""`
`Kersplash, kersplash, kersplash!!!`
` Keiichi and Shion turned the lane dividers into jump ropes, and the bodyguards fell into the pool one after another!`
`"Satoko, now!!!"`
`"Rikaaaaaa!!!`
` These swimsuits are too dangerous for a prank———!!!"`
`Satoko nimbly leapt through the path cleared by Keiichi and Shion, swinging in on a rope!`
`Of course Keiichi and Shion weren't slacking off either.`
` They were still going wild with the lane dividers, dumping the bodyguards into the pool like they were playing some kind of game.`
`"Satoko, why are you mad?`
` You had such a fun time, too."`
`"You never told me the galaxy would be destroyed because of them!!!"`
`"What are you talking about???"`
`While they managed to confuse the bodyguards and get them off of Rika, she was quite nimble herself.`
`She looked like she was spinning about as she ran, but she was cleverly predicting Satoko's trap zones and evading them.`
`"As I thought, Rika...`
` You can see right through me..."`
`"I know everything about you, down to how you sleep, how you yawn, your habits, and your tastes.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`"This is bad...`
` If she's reading Satoko's traps this thoroughly..."`
`"This is no time to be playing tag! Dammit, the hour's almost up...!!!"`
`"No... There's one more option.`
` Satoko should realize that too."`
`"We'll just have to gamble on that!!!`
` Ah, crap!"`
`Keiichi slipped.`
` The bodyguards didn't let that chance escape, and dogpiled onto Keiichi!`
`"O-Oh no...!!!`
` Shion, take care of the rest!!!`
` I'll get out of this somehow...!!!`
` Mgah! Let go! Nngh!!!"`
`Keiichi struggled to escape from the mountain of bodyguards that kept leaping in and piling up on top of him.`
`The club members couldn't wait for his escape, though.`
` So instead, Shion steeled her resolve.`
`Shion's stern gaze met Satoko's eyes.`
` With just that moment of eye contact, they both understood what the other was planning.`
`"That's the only way... to stop Rika.`
` Though!"`
`"This really should be Kei-chan's role!`
` Oh well!`
` We'll have to leave the rest to him!"`
`"......?`
` Fufu, I don't know what you two are plotting,`
` but even with two of you, I won't fall for Satoko's traps that easily."`
`It was true.`
` Rika had a solid read on them.`
`Satoko's traps were very dangerous.`
` That was all the more reason she always subconsciously made sure to keep herself from getting caught in their activation.`
`That was why she could predict Satoko's traps by gauging the distance she kept while driving others toward them.`
`No matter how close she pressed in, Satoko always backed off when pushing them into the trap zone.`
` As long as she didn't miss that moment, she would never be driven into Satoko's traps!`
`"Though the moment you're convinced of that... is the moment you've fallen for my trap."`
`"Huh?!"`
`"Now, Satoko!!!"`
`Satoko and Shion both leapt at her together.`
`It certainly wasn't impossible to overwhelm her with two attacking at once.`
`However, there were still many bodyguards around.`
` Even if they both restrained her temporarily, the crowd of bodyguards would quickly peel them off of her and restrain them.`
`That's why she couldn't understand it.`
` For a moment she couldn't understand Satoko and Shion's play, and that opening was all they needed to grapple her. `
`Naturally, the bodyguards rushed to Rika-sama shouting, "Save her!" and ended up in a massive ball of people.`
`There was no way they could strip her swimsuit from her with all of the men there...!`
`"Wha... What?!`
` No way!"`
`"The ultimate technique of Satoko-style trap arts!`
` Casting aside your own safety and incorporating yourself into the trap!"`
`"No way!!!`
` You're actually hitting yourself too...?!"`
`"Save Rika-samaaaaaaa! Rika-samaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Kei-chan, the rest is up to you!!!"`
`Kabooooom...!!!`
`A roar.`
` A flash.`
` An explosion.`
` Satoko's all-out trap erupted...`
`After the tremendous smoke slowly cleared, Rika, as well as Satoko and Shion, and also all of the bodyguards were passed out with stars circling above their heads...`
`Satoko had never once before used the kamikaze technique of catching both herself and her opponent in the same trap.`
`That wasn't because she couldn't do it.`
` She had held it in reserve the whole time.`
`To use as a trump card one day when facing Rika, the person closest to her, who knew everything about her traps...!!!`
`However, since both Shion and Satoko had grappled Rika, they had both taken the full brunt of the trap.`
`All three of them had rings of stars spinning above their heads.`
`"I-Incredible...`
` She took them all out at once..."`
`However, there was no time to savor this victory.`
` They were already down to only five minutes left!`
`They'd taken Rika down, but they still had Rena left.`
`He had also lost all the allies he could count on.`
` ...It was hopeless.`
`"Even so... I have to fight!!!`
` I'm the only one who can save the galaxy...!"`
`Keiichi approached Rika with the towel they had readied... and then he finally... realized the fatal flaw in this situation.`
`"...No... wait...`
` C-Crap...!"`
`"W-Who's going to remove Rika-chan's swimsuit?!`
` W-Will I have to do it?!"`
`However, they had caused a big commotion.`
` Lots of normal guests were looking over to see what was going on.`
`S-So we would have to sneakily carry Rika-chan somewhere away from people, Keiichi thought...`
`Impossible!!!`
` There were even more normal guests now that it was the afternoon!!!`
`It was impossible to find a place out of sight, and if anyone happened to see, rumors would spread through the entire village and he'd be arrested on the spot!!!`
`The fate of the galaxy rests on removing her swimsuit!`
` But of course, he couldn't say that to some woman he didn't know and ask for her help...!!!`
`"...It's finished.`
` ...Our galaxy is done for..."`
`"I'll remove it for you.`
` Just turn around and face the other way."`
`"Huh? ...Rena?!"`
`Rena appeared out of nowhere and safely recovered Rika-chan's swimsuit...`
`W-What was going on...?`
`"The swimsuits Rika-chan brought really were full of incredible power, huh.`
` It wouldn't be odd if there was some price to pay for it."`
`"Besides...`
` there's no meaning to charm you don't cultivate yourself.`
` If you get popular from charm that isn't your own, you'll just feel empty in the end."`
`"...Oh... Ohh."`
`He thought Rena would be the most elated about it all, but the truth was the exact opposite.`
`Rena had been calm from the very start.`
`After seeing that Rika's swimsuits actually possessed supernatural power, she suspected that there had to be some kind of catch behind it.`
`"Huh?!`
` Then from the start, you...?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` I was afraid of them, so I decided not to wear it."`
`"W-W-What?!`
` You didn't?!`
` Then I could have given you a revelation and gotten you on our side way before now!`
` I thought you were wearing one and couldn't receive my messages... Auauauau!"`
`"Though we're really lucky you didn't!`
` We have less than five minutes left, but now we might just barely make it!"`
`"So, where is the irresistible swimsuit intended for you?"`
`"It's in my locker in the changing room.`
` I'll go get it."`
`"There's almost no time left.`
` Please hurry!"`
`"Yeah, got it!`
` ...Ah!"`
`"Huh?"`
`Kaboom!!!`
`Rena felt herself step on something unusual, and a huge washtub hit her square in the head...`
`It was one of the traps set for the battle against Rika that hadn't gone off...`
`"R-Rena...? A-Are you okay...?!"`
`"Uuu~ ...Mmn... I-I'm fine~~... Nn~..."`
`Thump!`
`Rena spun around twice and then collapsed onto the ground.`
`Her eyes were filled with stars too...!`
`What a terrible reversal at the very last minute...!!!`
`"T-This is just plain bad, isn't it...?`
` Rena's swimsuit is still inside the women's changing room! `
`Fortunately Rena had the locker number and the key on her arm, so that's taken care of... but there's no way I can go into the women's changing room!!!"`
`Satoko, Shion, and Rena are all passed out and done for, Keiichi thought.`
`Oh, right!`
` Mion!`
` There's Mion!!!`
`Her uncle dragged her away saying they were busy with customers, but surely she's free by now...?`
`"Ehh?! This isn't the end of the line!`
` Please don't run!!!`
` If you all won't cooperate, then we won't be able to keep this restaurant open here anymore!"`
`"Everyone, please prepare your payment ahead of time so you won't need any change!`
` Oh, we have new limitations on the menu!`
` Customers are now limited to one 'Pretty Poolside Pettanko Pudding' per customer!!!"`
`"H-Hey, Mion...`
` Can you lend a hand to save the galaxy...?"`
`"Saku-chan, take over line management for a second!!!`
` I'm going into the back to give the owner a break!!!`
` Everyone, stay hydrated!!!`
` Don't get heatstroke!!!"`
`"Hina-chan, Rin-chan, man the registers!!!`
` Uhh, also, I'm heading into the back, so uhh, uhh, water, water, water... ..."`
`"Kyaah! Sonozaki-san collapsed!!!"`
`The Okinomiya Public Pool Branch of Angel Morte was doing tremendously great business.`
`Apparently they were offering a special bonus today, so they were swarmed with a terrible number of customers.`
`Mion was fighting bravely on the front lines, but then she collapsed...`
`"No, no, no!`
` What do I do now?!`
` This is bad! There goes my final hope!!!`
` That was the last person who might go into the girl's changing room for me!!!"`
`There was only five minutes left.`
`He was completely out of ideas for women he could convince in such a short time to bring him the swimsuit from Rena's locker in order to save the galaxy!!!`
`"W-W-What do we do now, Keiichi?!!!`
` At this rate, the galaxy! The galaxy is doomed!!!`
` Can't you use your incredible persuasion powers to con someone into doing something about this?!!!"`
`"That power of mine only works on other men!!!`
` Can't you use your divine powers to convince some girl to do it?!"`
`"Right now my powers are weak, and I can only provide revelations to the club members, since they're so close to me!!!"`
`"Gaaaaaaaaaaah!!!`
` What do we do?!`
` What am I supposed to do?!`
` Aaah, there's no time!!!"`
`"A-At this point, Keiichi!!!`
` You'll have to brave the women's changing room, for the sake of the galaxy!!!"`
`"I refuse!!!`
` If the price for saving the galaxy is being labeled a pervert who stormed into the women's changing room, then it's too much! There's too little reward for it! `
`If it means bearing that label, then I would rather perish and have 'he was a gentleman towards women until the end' carved into my tombstone!!!"`
`"S-So you're saying you could do it if you're rewarded?!`
` If you're granted a reward that's worth it, then you can find the bravery to charge into the women's changing room?!"`
`"But there is no reward!!!`
` Aaaaah, the galaxy is finished!!!"`
`"Keiichi.`
` I promise you this: I'll use all of my current power... to grant you the ultimate miracle once you safely return from the women's changing room!!!"`
`"I'm listening!"`
`"I-I'll grant you a wonderful summer love affair!!!`
` The brave savior of the galaxy will end up drinking juice from the same heart-shaped straw as a beautiful woman in a swimsuit by the poolside!!! `
`I promise I will absolutely, absolutely make that happen!!!"`
`"Okay, got it. No more problems.`
` Leave the galaxy to me!"`
`Though that being said!!!`
` What now, Maebara Keiichi?!`
` Be cool, Maebara Keiichi!!!`
`How will you retrieve Rena's swimsuit from the women's changing room?!`
`Will you ask someone? You have no leads!`
` You have to do it yourself!!!`
` However, it's plain as day what will happen if a guy goes into the women's changing room!`
`"R... Right..."`
`First he headed to the first aid station.`
`Irie was still asleep there with stars circling above his head.`
`On his arm was the key for his locker.`
`Keiichi borrowed that and headed for the men's changing room.`
`Him entering the men's changing room was no problem at all!`
`He opened the locker listed on the key's tag and found there Irie's belongings.`
`"Coach mentioned it before!`
` He told Satoko to change into his English maid style swimsuit!`
` That means he has one with him!`
` A woman's swimsuit! `
`He even mentioned that he had it available in all possible sizes...!!!"`
`"I knew it!`
` There it is!`
` H-He even has a woman's wig to go along with it!!!`
` W-What was Coach planning to do with this after bringing it to the pool...?"`
`"Auauau—!!!`
` Keiichi, there's no time to be impressed~!!!"`
`"Whoa!!!`
` Three minutes left?!!!`
` B-But i-in order to pull off this operation... I have to cast it aside!!!`
` My pride as a man! My gentlemanly spirit! Everything that's made me who I am today!!!"`
`There was only 120 seconds left...`
`A "girl" in an English maid style swimsuit was timidly entering the women's changing room...`
`...Calm down. Be cool, Maebara Keiichi...!!!`
`I'm not a molester. I'm not a peeping tom. I'm not a pervert!`
` I'm doing this to save the galaxy!!!`
`"...Don't look around you!`
` I'm not here to watch women change.`
` So don't look around you. Look only at your feet...!"`
`"Ahh, but if I only look at my feet, then I can't make my way to Rena's locker...!`
` O-Oh well, I'll just have to occasionally look up...!"`
`Fh... Fhaaaaaaaah...!`
`A sweet aroma filled my nostrils...`
` No way! Why is a space for women to change in filled with such a sweet smell?!`
`Don't blush, and don't panic, Maebara Keiichi!!!`
` It's alright! You're currently crossdressing!`
` Don't act suspicious, and no one will notice!`
` As long as no one finds out, then you're fine!!!`
`"Beware of Perverts!`
` Beware of Peepers!`
` If You See Anyone Suspicious, Inform the Nearest Staff Member!"`
`"Beware of Locker Thieves!`
` If You See Anyone Suspicious, Report Them Immediately!"`
`"Do Not Tolerate Perverts!`
` Death to Perverts!`
` Seize Any Enemies to Women, Strip Them Bare, and Drag Them Through the City Completely Nude!!!"`
`Ugyaaaaaaah...! If I'm caught, I'm dead!`
` Socially, mentally, and physically!!!`
` They'll make me regret being born a man, and then kill me!!!`
`Bounce, bounce.`
` Jiggle, jiggle.`
`Rustle, rustle.`
` Snap, snap.`
`It's Hell!!!`
`This is Hell disguised as Heaven...!!!`
`I strongly refuse to let blood surge down below!`
` That's the one thing I must avoid!!!`
` Empty your mind and heart!!!`
` Maebara Keiichi, you must not be tempted by their allure, so that you can save the galaxy!!!`
`"Keiichi!`
` There's no time to waste!!!`
` There's only one minute left!!!"`
`"Dammit... Then what happens, happens...!!!"`
`He raced through in one shot.`
` Rena's locker was right there!!!`
`He nimbly unlocked it and opened up Rena's knapsack.`
`There!`
` That drawstring pouch!`
`The moment he pulled it out, an oddly small "handkerchief" with frills and a small ribbon fell out alongside it.`
`Yes.`
` It's only a handkerchief.`
` Don't question it, Maebara Keiichi!!!`
` R-Rena's such a girly girl. Even her handkerchiefs are so small, so light, and so cute!!!`
`"Keiichiiiii!!!`
` Thirty seconds left!!!`
` Do you not want your poolside love affair with a beautiful woman in a swimsuit?!"`
`"Uoooooooooh! Galaxy, galaxy, galaxyyyyyy!!! (Falsetto)"`
`Only scant seconds left!!!`
` He dashed out of the women's changing room, and threw the drawstring pouch toward the magic trash can by the other entrance!!!`
`Please, go iiiiiiin!!!`
`"Keiichiiiiiiiii!!!!!!"`
`Fwwp!`
`H-He did it...!!!`
` The last swimsuit disappeared into the magic trash can, and was purified...`
`There was only one second left to spare...`
`Mankind... No, the Earth and the whole galaxy... were saved...!!!`
`"...Keiichi.`
` No, the savior of our galaxy.`
` Congratulations on your success.`
` I'm exhausted after sending away four foreign objects, but as promised, I'll use the last of my power to grant you your poolside dream... `
`...Now then, Keiichi, until we meet again.`
` On the next night of Watanagashi..."`
`"I did it...`
` I actually did it..."`
`He honestly wanted to strike a victory pose and shout out loud.`
`However, he was still crossdressing.`
` There were plenty of guests from Hinamizawa around him as well.`
`For now he would hold it in, and duck into a bathroom or something in order to change back into male attire...`
`"Hey, hold up, lady."`
`W-What?!`
` Some delinquents with pompadours were hassling Keiichi.`
`He must have run into them when he dashed out of the women's changing room to throw the swimsuit in the trash.`
`"Ya broke my bro's collarbone!!!`
` Whatcha gunna do for us now?!"`
`"It hurts! It hurts!!!`
` This ain't gunna heal 'less y'have a drink wi' me!!!"`
`...What the hell are these punks saying?`
`Besides, I'm a guy! A guy!`
` ...Though I can't reveal that right now.`
`Doing so might get rid of the delinquents, but then the normal guests would find out that Maebara Keiichi came out of the women's changing room dressed like a girl!!!`
`...I have to wait for my chance... without exposing that I'm a guy...`
`"Hey. Hold it right there.`
` I won't stand by and watch three guys gang up on a woman."`
`Huh?`
` W-Who...?`
`"W-What the hell!!!`
` B-Buzz off!!"`
`The delinquents were slightly overwhelmed, despite their show of spirit.`
`That was because the man who showed up was someone who could never be described as weak.`
`The muscles in his legs were visibly toned, and it was obvious they had both endurance and explosive strength.`
`His arm muscles were impressive as well.`
` They were nicely tanned, and it was clear that he never once skipped out on training underneath the hot sun.`
`His head was shaved in a clean crew cut as well.`
` Not to mention the fact that his burning gaze was filled with unwavering resolve!`
`"I'm the ace of Ooshima High's baseball team!!!`
` And I'm willing to give up participating in Koshien if it means protecting a woman!!!`
` Would you rather see my blazing fastball here and now, or in the stadium?!"`
`W-Wow.`
` Keiichi never thought the day would come where he saw his soul brother Kameda-kun displaying such glory...`
`He was the kind of pervert to compare a dessert to a woman and then lick and slurp it down, but in that very moment, he looked like a savior...`
`"Meep.`
` I didn't do anything wrong.`
` It's all Hanyuu's fault."`
`"You should be more sorry about this!`
` You nearly wiped out the galaxy!"`
`"By the way, why am I in an Angel Mort uniform?"`
`"Because you should feel guilty for your crimes and atone by working in Shion-san's stead!!!"`
`"So items from another world are made of antimatter?`
` ...If only there were some way to utilize that energy for something."`
`"The miracle of making you popular just by wearing it takes so much energy it can destroy the galaxy."`
`"In other words,`
` if you really want to be popular, then instead of taking shortcuts, you should just try and work on yourself instead."`
`"By the way, where is the savior of our galaxy?"`
`"According to Hanyuu, he's drinking juice by the poolside with a beautiful woman in a swimsuit."`
`"I don't see him, though? I wonder where he is."`
`"You don't need to hold back. It's my treat.`
` Go on, drink up, drink up.`
` Sluuurp♪"`
`W-Why do I... have to drink juice from a heart-shaped straw with Kameda-kun...?!?!`
`Am I not the savior?!`
` Is the savior Kameda-kun?!`
`The gods of Hinamizawa are awful! I knew they couldn't be trusted!`
` Give me back my offering!!!`
`...Ah... Rika just looked over here.`
`Rika-chan, it's me, Keiichi.`
` Notice me, please.`
` And drag me away from Kameda-kun, please...!!!`
`"...Meep."`
`"Well, Rika?`
` Did you see Keiichi-san over there?"`
`"Nope, not at all.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`Nnnnoooooooooo! Rika-chaaaaaaaan!!!`
`"Oh?!?!`
` That swimsuit is an English maid style swimsuit!!!`
` To think a beautiful woman with such a dignified maid's soul would be found here at the poolside!!!"`
`"What's that, old man?!`
` Oh, my Soul Brother, Iri!!!`
` I was the first to speak to this girl, so please back off!!!"`
`"I find it hard to believe you're capable of understanding the reserved culture of such a land as Britain!`
` A wonderful woman such as her needs a master of more fitting stature!`
` Like me!!!"`
`"Young lady, please hold on a moment.`
` I'll remove this perverted old man in a jiffy.`
` Once I'm done, I'll apply some sunscreen to your back."`
`"Laughably absurd!!!`
` You are my ideal maid!`
` I'll welcome you into my home and train you to be the ultimate servant!!!"`
`"Doryaaaaah! Take my bullet fastball!!!"`
`"Fufu, how naive. That was a mere afterimage!"`
`"I've already seen right through you!!!"`
`"Hoho? Not bad!!!"`
`Bash, bash, bam, bam...`
`The beautiful girl in a swimsuit and a twin-tail wig sat at a poolside table with a parasol`
` watching as her two brave saviors fought over her...`
`"...Die.`
` And take the whole galaxy with you..."`
`The galaxy might be filled with countless stars,`
`but the unhappy star of misfortune was always shining above Keiichi...`
