`"We'd truly like to thank you for playing through Higurashi When They Cry Watanagashi-hen~☆`
` This is the creator, Ryukishi07."`
`"This is the main culprit, Yatazakura."`
`"...Man~ ...You often see afterwords in doujinshi, but we're not done at a~ll while I'm tryping this out☆`
` There's still work left."`
`"Yeah...`
` The Christmas songs have stopped too......"`
`"Jingle be~lls, jingle be~lls, swapping covers out~☆`
` We made covers with the wrong addre~ss♪`
` Only thirty hours left until Winterket~♪ `
`Swapping out 150 covers~ finalizing the master copy~ burning off 150 discs~...... Someone tell me this isn't reaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!!"`
`"Is this the last text left before we hit master up...?`
` I've only got four hours until I go to work tomorrow...!!"`
`"Nnhooooh...! Thank you for all your work~... My workplace is done for the year starting today~ Though now we're ringing in the new year with a mountain of work ourselves~☆"`
`"I'm starting to lose my sense of balance......"`
`"......Uguu...`
` I'm dizzy from drinking too many energy drinks☆`
` By the way, I'm typing 'hoshi' to produce the ☆, but sometimes I accidentally type 'hshi' (Death by H), and it still converts to ☆ nya~☆"`
`"Death by H?!`
` Y-You knew of that, Raiden?!"`
`"......I don't know, but if it's possible, I'd love to experience it this very day."`
`".........The discussion has gotten sidetracked for a while."`
`"Well... then we should start getting serious."`
`"Ahem..."`
`Good evening, everyone.`
` This is Ryukishi07.`
`We're finally able to deliver the second chapter of the serialized sound novel, Higurashi When They Cry, that we started in Summerket 2002.`
`We were planning to announce this in the fall, but since our day jobs were working us to the bone, the announcement kept meeting delay after delay and we're very sorry.`
`However, I believe we've packed everything we wanted to do into this to make up for it.`
`We hope you all will enjoy it too☆`
`"Now, Ryukishi07-san.`
` When will the next script be done?"`
`"...Hmm... Spring Revo... No!`
` By next Summerket at the latest!!"`
`"......I'm having a Shou-chan Vision of ourselves in this exact same hell six months from now!!"`
`"...G-Gao.`
` ...I'll do my best......"`
`"......Oh?`
` I just had a strange vision of my own."`
`"??`
` What did you see?"`
`"Well,`
` this image."`
`"...............Ah!!`
` I-I forgot~!!`
` Mufufufufufu! We'll be keeping this one secret for now.`
` Mfufufu!!"`
`"What on earth is this...?`
` Is this some...... a figure?!`
` A garage kit?!`
` Or as the experts say, is this a garakiiii?!`
` Now that you mention it... it looks like Rena! `
`It looks like the Rena bouncing in front of the title!!`
` I'm certain of it!`
` She's even wielding a lance?!"`
`...Wow... We were both surprised...`
`But apparently our test player, reshizou22-san...`
` is trying his hand at making a figure of Rena...!!`
`"Wow~...!!`
` This... is incredible, isn't it?!!`
` You could sell this once it's finished, couldn't you...?!?!"`
`"Uhh... the details haven't been settled yet though.`
` Apparently he's aiming to produce it by February 2003's WonFes...!`
` I'm really, really... looking forward to it!!`
` We're so grateful, reshizou22-san!!!"`
`"......Apparently he's trying to recreate the way she pops up in the opening...`
` Unya~ I can't wait, nya~~!!!`
` I want to take her home~!!"`
`"If we get further news of his progress, we'll let you know☆`
` ......Man, I wonder how it'll look when he's done...... I really can't wait to see it!"`
`"Speaking of that,`
` I'm really grateful to BT-san too for making that really awesome minigame this time around~!!!`
`The 'Rena Punch' from last time was good too, but this round's 'SFB' has so many hidden modes, and he really went all out making it!"`
`"K-Fla's Oraora Mode in the latter half of the fight is a special must-see!`
` I hope you'll all try playing it☆"`
`"......When I first saw K-Fla, I thought it was an H-game☆`
` Teehee☆"`
`"Death by H!!!`
` Death by H for sure!!!"`
`"......Hooh.`
` We still haven't started printing from the master copy yet, and you're already prepared to die?"`
`"...Hahh... I want to die already.`
` I want it all to be over☆`
` So with that♪`
` death by H~~!!!"`
`"What kind of death by H would you prefer, Ryukishi07-san?"`
`"H-Hau?!`
` ...W-Will it happen if I say it?!?!`
` For certain?!"`
`"Well, try saying it to find out, miso~☆"`
`"Well, of course!!`
` By ****ing a big breasted ***** schooler with a beam saber holstered in her red backpack, hahh hahh!!`
`Then after I've enjoyed lots of *** with her, we'll go even further and **** and then go one more round of play!!`
` On top of that, I'd have her call me ********... Hahh, hahh☆`
` Hahh, hahh, death by H."`

`"Ryukishi-san has set off on a journey to the eternal world, so I, Yatazakura, will be taking his place.`
`We're truly grateful to all of you test players who played through the previous Onikakushi chapter and sent us your impressions! `
`We hope that you'll let us hear what you thought, and what you noticed in this title as well."`
`We plan to work hard creating our next title.`
`So once again, we thank you all very much for playing this game☆`
`I'm also grateful to my little brothers for dedicatedly helping me instead of abandoning me to this hell where we still haven't finished up the master copy even at this hour......`
`As well as to all of you who picked up this title☆`
