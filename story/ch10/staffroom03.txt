`"Hello, Ryukishi07 here.`
` Higurashi's finally up to chapter six!`
` If we were on a plane right now, the announcer would be telling everyone to fasten their seatbelts as we prepare for landing!"`
`"Though once you're bound by your seatbelt, there's nowhere left to run until it crashes, nya.`
` Yatazakura here, nya."`
`"Now, now!`
` By the way, what's our circle going to create once Higurashi's finished?"`
`"I'd like to brainstorm a few ideas ahead of time, regardless of whether or not we can do them, nya.`
` So for now, let's just say anything and everything we want, nya!"`
`Next Work Classroom`
`For Games Even Monkeys Can Make (AKA Monkey Works)`
`"Let's iron out some ideas for our next work, nya."`
`"Mhmm."`
`"First we'll need to pick the genre, nya.`
` Ryukishi-san, what game did you find the most entertaining when you were a child, nya?"`
`"The most entertaining...?"`
`FINAL F▲NTASY`
`"Ohh!`
` That really was entertaining, nya!`
` Dreams,`
` adventure,`
` romance,`
` and mechs...`
` Also, encounters and separation, friendship and hard work.`
` Yeah, we can make that work, nya!"`
`Final Fantasy ▼...`
`This was a game Ryukishi07 once played like crazy on the SNES.`
`The story was simple, yet orthodox and easily relatable, and the lack of weird pretension left a good impression.`
`There were adventures, and battles between the heroes and villains over the crystals and their power...`
`Also, like the other odd numbered games in the series, it featured a familiar job change system, but this one was refined into the greatest one throughout the series (or so this author believes).`
`There were countless strategies that could be formed by combining the abilities from various jobs, which suggested many different ways one could defeat the various bosses, so even after you beat the game, it still held a charm that made you want to play it again...`
`It's widely known to those involved in this circle that our mascot character, Ryukishi Rena, was actually born out of love for that game...`
`"RPGs make it easier to empathize with the characters. `
`The way steady effort lets you earn EXP and guarantees you can clear the hurdles before you, along with the party's friendship leading to victory is really well suited to Japanese people, nya."`
`"That's right, that's right!`
` Our next work has to be FF▼!`
` We'll make our very own FF▼!"`
`"Fundamentally it'll have a taste of RPG, and the plot will develop in line with Jump's three golden rules: effort, friendship, and battles.`
` The combination of various jobs will give a real sense of gameplay.`
`...Yeah, that sounds pretty great if we can make it happen, nya!`
` ......However, none of us can do such advanced programming work, nya. `
`We have to limit ourselves to something that can be created on N-Scripter, nya."`
`"Hmmm...`
` Which means... we'll have to go with... a sound novel story with a taste of RPG."`
`"We'll need to iron out the story too, nya.`
` Battles over crystals sounds interesting, nya, but the crystals are synonymous with FF▼, nya. We'll have to be careful about that, nya. `
`So Ryukishi-san, what was the most entertaining movie out of all the ones you've seen, nya?"`
`"...Hmmmm, the most entertaining movie...?"`
`Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,`
`starring Harrison Ford (aired in 1989).`
`"Ohh!`
` That movie was hailed as a roller coaster ride, and its exciting twists and turns are perfect for the modern audience that hates downtime, nya!"`
`"Of all the ones in the series, the third one, The Last Crusade, was a magnificent action film where Indy fought the Nazis of the Third Reich over the Holy Grail and the power of immortality within, their battles spanning across the globe!"`
`"With low budget films being in style nowadays, the huge scale of it was novel, nya."`
`"That's right, that's right!`
` Our next work has to be Indy!`
` We'll make our very own Indy!"`
`"So, if we're going to adapt that, then first, I think we should update the setting to modern times."`
`"...If we do that, then...`
` We'll have four modern students going on a big adventure for the Holy Grail..."`
`"No, the Holy Grail would fall under the Agency for Cultural Affairs' jurisdiction, nya.`
` They'd have to contact the Vatican too, so students would never be able to touch it, nya. `
`One wrong move and it'd become an international incident, nya."`
`"So then we just need to make the main character an employee at the Agency for Cultural Affairs! `
`If we do that, then they can go in and out of ancient ruins too, and they'll be able to uncover legendary treasures as well!"`
`"So then what?`
` The agency employee gets a job change and fights evil?`
` What's a job change here anyway?`
` Is he going to become a Warrior, Ranger, Black Mage, or something, nya? `
`The term Warrior doesn't the fit the time period at all, and I don't think the young people living in the now of modern times would get it, nya."`
`"...Hmmmmmmm.........`
` Ah!!`
` I've got it, Yatazakura! How about this?!!`
` We'll use the english characters people in this modern generation love!!`
` For Warrior, we'll use Saber!`
`For Ranger, we'll use Archer, and for Black Mage, we'll use Caster!!`
` There's plenty of others we could use too, like Lancer, Rider, Berserker, etc.!!`
`So then the heroes chosen to fight over the legendary Holy Grail, which can grant the wish of anyone who obtains it, will command characters that possess one of those jobs, and throw themselves into never ending battles!!"`
`"That sounds interesting!!`
` That sounds interesting, Ryukishi-san!`
` How on earth did you come up with that?!`
` It's wonderful!!`
` It brings out that fantasy feel with a resemblance to FF▼'s job system! `
`It captures the hectic, back and forth battles of Indiana Jones over some legendary treasure!`
` Plus doing it as a sound novel instead of an RPG is a novel take, nya!!!`
`Plus that worldview of the supernatural lurking everywhere in modern day society rings out with the mystery and otherworldliness that's at the leading edge of popularity now, nya!`
`This will have a huge impact on the world of doujin games, nya!!`
` A title like that will reverberate throughout society!!"`
`"We did it! We've surpassed Higurashi!!`
` Yes, yes! That settles it, that's our next title noooooow!!!"`
`"Alright, let's take that wonderful setting we came up with and iron it out a little more, nya!`
` First, what should we go with for the title, nya?"`
`"Yes!`
` I have a revolutionary title that I just thought of!"`
`"What a coincidence, nya.`
` I just thought of a title as well, nya."`
`"Oh? Then let's both say ours together!"`
`""Fate/s*ay night!""`
`""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!""`
