`In the distant town of Okinomiya`
` we saw smoke rising from fires here and there.`
`We had a very clear view of it as it hung ominously over the whole town.`
`Occasionally the wind carried the sound`
` of screams, raging, and unidentifiable, these portentous noises echoing in the quiet town.`
`"......It sounds like something's dying cry."`
`"This isn't just in Hinamizawa, huh..."`
`"Does this mean... the virus has finally spread to Okinomiya...?"`
`"............Rika......"`
`Rika had stayed behind in Hinamizawa of her own volition.`
`We tried to stop her since it was dangerous,`
` but seeing this sight, maybe it really was better to stay in Hinamizawa where we knew our way around.`
`Mion was still injured, but for the time being she seemed stable.`
`Still, she'd only been given first-aid.`
` She still needed to see a doctor.`
`The rioters had broken into the Irie Clinic, so it was abandoned, and Irie was nowhere to be found.`
`"Anyway, we need to find you a doctor."`
`"I'm doing fine. Sure, it hurts, but it's settled down a lot."`
`"No. If you don't get proper treatment, then it could fester later."`
`"We'll just have to search for a doctor."`
`"It's hard to imagine any doctors are open for business with things like this."`
`"......Let's head for the office of the Sonozaki Group. My mother and the others there should be able to do something..."`
`"You think Shii-chan's there too?"`
`"Given what's happened, that's the safest place to be."`
`"......I just hope those people are still reasonable......"`
`"Anyway, let's check out the town. We can't stay up here forever."`
`"......Right. Is this disaster only happening here? Or has it expanded out to the rest of Japan? ......We don't know anything here in Hinamizawa."`
`"The idea that this could be happening all over the world... I don't want to think about it......"`
`"Let's go. ......I'm all right. I can walk by myself."`
`Normally we'd go to Okinomiya by bicycle.`
`But it was easy to imagine that rioters would be acting like the neighborhood watch here in Okinomiya, just like they were in Hinamizawa.`
`The whole virus commotion originated in Hinamizawa.`
` So the people in Okinomiya should, naturally, view everyone coming from Hinamizawa as an enemy.`
`We decided it was too dangerous to move on roads likely with a watch on them, so we headed there on foot using back paths instead.`
`The kind of routes used by gatherers, the elderly, and the children that ran around in the fields of Hinamizawa were the safest ones.`
`While Keiichi and the others headed to Okinomiya......`
`Keiichi's parents had evacuated themselves to the Sonozakis' secret underground tunnels.`
`There were already some resources stored down there, so they'd be safe for a while.`
`Still, they needed to reach a place that was even safer, one with plenty of food and medical treatment.`
`Confirming whether or not such a safe space even existed was their biggest objective behind scouting out Okinomiya......`
`".........There's mounds of corpses."`
`"It's an awful sight......"`
`The miserable remains of those beaten to death by the rioters`
` lay here and there on the shoulders of the streets.`
`Even Hanyuu shook her head at the swarm of flies and the pervasive stench of death......`
`"......But it's grown quieter."`
`"Yes, it has......"`
`"This is about the time when nearly all of those who let the demons of paranoia into their hearts die off, after trying to kill each other."`
`"..............."`
`That roaring wind that was like the ominous groan of a dragon... could no longer be heard.`
`All that enveloped Hinamizawa in its place was the silence of death.`
`The screams of those who allowed the demons into their hearts and began killing each other`
` could no longer be heard either...`
`"But it doesn't hurt to be cautious."`
`"True. I can't die before I see how this crazy world ends."`
`"Where are you going?"`
`"The Irie Clinic's basement. That should be the safest place in Hinamizawa right now, don't you think?"`
`The underground research ward was filled with the silence of death as well.`
`So as long as she didn't mind the corpses and the trails of bright red blood splatter staining the pale white walls,`
` it was the perfect place to hide out for a while.`
`"......Are there still violent ones in the village?"`
`"Yes...... I think it should quiet down soon, but for now..."`
`"Then it's settled. Let's wait for the heat to die down. We should be able to find someone's drinks and snacks down there, plus the bathrooms are nice."`
`Rika and Hanyuu made their way to the Irie Clinic.`
`After all that time they spent researching the disease...`
` ...it turned out they were just a den of incompetents, unable to do anything at all.`
`They passed through animal trails in the mountains`
` and through footpaths between the fields.`
`Sometimes they held their breath and tried to sense the presence of nearby people,`
` while other times they ran like rabbits.`
`Then once they jumped right over the guardrails...`
` they were in Okinomiya.`
`Every now and then the wind would carry a roar from the distance, along with smoke and the smell of something burning.`
`The town was deathly quiet, but it wasn't dead.`
`The rioters who allowed paranoia into their hearts`
` were only lying in wait as they teemed with rage.`
`"......It might be more dangerous here than in Hinamizawa."`
`"Agreed...... I've got nothing but bad feelings about this..."`
`"Are there riots here because of fear about the virus as well......?"`
`"This is just my theory, but... I think this might be a symptom of the virus, actually."`
`"Maybe so."`
`"What do you mean......?"`
`"So it's like a human version of rabies......"`
`"I thought everyone was going crazy out of fear of this killer virus, ......but that's not enough to explain everything."`
`"An illness that stokes unfounded fears and suspicions until the victim is driven by nothing else..."`
`"Does a disease like that really exist? I mean, they never mentioned any of that on TV......"`
`"TV doesn't always tell the truth. Besides, there's a possibility the killer virus part was just a wrong guess."`
`"......They're both equally frightening, that's for sure."`
`"But why are we fine, then?"`
`"......Maybe we're resistant?"`
`"Well, even if we're not showing any symptoms, we can't rule out the possibility that we're still carrying the disease."`
`"Is it really okay? For us to go into the city like this?"`
`"It shouldn't be a problem. Not judging by this state of affairs."`
`We advanced carefully, checking to make sure the roads were clear.`
`Abandoned cars formed lines on the city streets.`
`Some cars had crashed into each other and were still smoking at various intersections.`
`Even on the sidewalks`
` we saw the scattered remains of people murdered under suspicion of being infected......`
`"I just hope Shion and Mion's parents are still sane......"`
`"......Mom and Dad are keeping everyone in line, I'm sure."`
`"Shion-san does have a quick temper......"`
`"There's a huge gap between how Shii-chan acts when she's calm and when she isn't...... I'm a little worried about her."`
`"She'll be fine. Shion won't talk back to Mom at times like this. ......I'm sure Mom will be keeping everyone organized."`
`If Oryou had been healthy, even the Hinamizawa town council wouldn't have lost its cool.`
`Mion had already gotten a taste of how strong leadership could prevent chaos ahead of time.`
`"This virus probably drives people to attack others out of fear and anxiety. ......So with strong leadership, teamwork, and trust, they should be able to maintain their senses."`
`"You think the virus commotion fostered fear... and their terror ran rampant?"`
`"That idea feels right to me. At the very least, even Hinamizawa didn't start acting weird up until the JSDF left and stopped doing their jobs."`
`"That is true. ......Once the JSDF left, everyone grew frightened all at once, and the world went mad......"`
`Satoko raised her voice to note that sudden memory.`
`"That reminds me, Rika said something too. ......She said that people with strong hearts will be fine, since you won't hand them over to the demons."`
`"Rika-chan said that?"`
`"Yes. ...I just assumed she meant something along the lines of 'illness starts in the mind' but......"`
`"Maybe there is a chance...... she meant exactly what she said..."`
`"......There was that moment when the blood rushed to our heads when Rena and I went to rescue Satoko. ......Maybe that was really risky for the two of us."`
`"Maybe so. But we managed to stay calm even as that fire burned strong in our hearts."`
`"Let your heart run hot, and keep your thoughts cool. ......Maybe the reason we didn't end up like the others is because we've been training ourselves for these kind of situations in Mion's club."`
`"If you lose your cool and hand your heart over to primal emotions, then you go crazy. ......If you call the result of that process a demon, then it fits with the legends passed down from long ago about Onigafuchi Village."`
`"You mean that legend about demons coming up out of the swamp?"`
`"I'm sure something similar to this happened long ago. ......And I'm positive the people thrown into paranoia and running around out of control were called demons."`
`"...Makes sense. I think we're getting a grasp of what's going on."`
`"Still, if there were legends left about it, then that means the whole thing was settled, and people survived. ......So this isn't hopeless. We have hope."`
`"Right. This commotion isn't going to destroy the world. There's guaranteed to be a way to end it."`
`"Is waiting for Oyashiro-sama to descend the only option we have......?"`
`"That's how it ended back then, according to the legends. ......The people were unable to do anything except wait for Oyashiro-sama's descent."`
`"......Are you saying all we can do is wait, even with all this going on...?"`
`"If we're to follow the legends."`
`"Yeah, come on already! Oyashiro-sama! If you're out there watching this, then make with the descent and put a stop to this!!"`
`"Achoo!"`
`"Can Gods catch colds?"`
`"Au, au. Humans aren't the only ones that can sneeze, you know."`
`The Irie Clinic had been ransacked by rioters.`
`Believing the rumors that a cure was hidden here,`
` they had swarmed it en masse.`
`But that only applied to the sections on the surface.`
` Their riot hadn't extended to the secret research ward underground.`
`"There's nothing here, though. ......If Irie were around, he would've taken action long ago."`
`"......We mustn't avert our eyes..."`
`There were several corpses gathering flies there in the plundered clinic.`
`Those who believed in the cure`
` ultimately became convinced that someone there was hiding it, and began to kill each other......`
`Hanyuu covered her eyes after all, but Rika stepped over the corpses without any concern.`
`Some of the corpses were even familiar faces to her, but Rika didn't seem to care.`
`She passed through the secret door and headed underground.`
`It was far safer to stay behind the secret security door`
` than on the surface.`
`After all, all the researchers here were either murdered or committed suicide.`
` There was nothing safer than a place completely devoid of others......`
`The security system confirmed it was Rika Furude, and then the door opened.`
`Even though her expression never changed at the sight of the corpses,`
` she heaved a sigh of relief once she confirmed the door was shut behind her.`
`"Now we can do as we please, be that sleep through this, or snack on the treats someone stored down here. There's no one else here, after all."`
`"I'm surprised you're able to stay so calm amidst that dreadful sight...... I don't know if that's you being strong, or shameless......"`
`"I've experienced death, even my own, more times than I can count. So why should some stranger's corpse faze me at this point?"`
`"......Hahh. The old Rika was cuter. She was as scared as one should be for your age......"`
`"What should I fear at this point? ......Well, I suppose you could summon up a ghost. I'd be a little surprised if you did that!"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"W-What is it, Rika?! D-Don't start scaring me, okay...?"`
`The underground ward was supposed to be empty...`
` but she thought she heard something just then.`
`Was it her imagination......?`
`They both glanced at each other, held their breath, and strained their ears......`
`........................`
`"......You hear that...... right......?"`
`"I-Is it a ghost?!"`
`"...You're practically a ghost yourself, so why are you afraid? Still, what is this sound......?"`
`Far off in the distance there was a thnn....... thnn.....`
` They could hear that dull sort of sound repeating over and over.`
`They both nodded to each other and strained their ears,`
` trying to identify the source of the sound......`
`"Kill them! Kill them!`
` Kill the infected!!`
` Kill them and burn their corpses!!"`
`A group of ten young rioters dashed down the main street.`
`Their clothes were stained with the spray of blood,`
` and their eyes were bloodshot.`
`The bats and metal pipes in their hands were dripping with blood,`
` and were bent in unsettling directions.`
`"If those people find us... then we're really in trouble......"`
`"Were they college students? ......I guess this won't be as easy as facing Hinamizawa's elderly."`
`"We are fine, I think. They haven't found us."`
`"...Phew. ......This is a real pickle..."`
`The insane youths were dashing whenever they heard some commotion.`
`Then they killed those who fled,`
`those who begged for their lives, and occasionally those who stood against them.`
`They truly were acting like bloodthirsty demons.`
`......That very sight was most likely what the legends of Onigafuchi Village were passing down.`
`"Is the office far from here?"`
`"......In terms of distance, no, but if we're trying to avoid the main street, then it's surprisingly hard to get to......"`
`"The main street is full of crazies either running around everywhere or killing each other."`
`"Then let us practice safety first.`
` ......?! Quiet!"`
`We heard the rattling of an empty can rolling around somewhere behind us.`
`Someone had kicked the empty can trap Satoko set up earlier.`
`They weren't keeping quiet, either.`
` We could hear the loud voices of the rioters drawing close.`
`They had finally started searching the back alleys too in their search for more to kill.`
`"This is bad. They'll catch up to us......!"`
`"But we can't exactly run, either! They'll find us! We have to hide and wait them out!"`
`"Bring those trash cans over here! Create cover!! Hurry!!"`
`"Kei-chan, grab that one!!"`
`"Y-Yeah...!!`
` ......Uwah!"`
`It was an unfortunate mistake.`
` Keiichi's foot slipped on some of the garbage scattered around the trash can, and he went down, can and all.`
`The loud clatter echoed throughout the back alley......`
`"Hey!`
` I heard something!!`
` It must be another infected!!"`
`Others responded to that call, their war cries full of madness and rage roaring in the distance.`
`The cries came from both behind and in front of them.`
`"It's a pincer attack!!"`
`"We can't fight here! That'll only draw in even more of them!!"`
`"We'll have to break through the front! Let's push through to the office!"`
`"Ah, ow! Owwww?! S-Seriously...?!"`
`"Keiichi-kun?! Did you sprain your leg?!"`
`Everyone's blood froze in an instant.`
` Because that meant they just lost their one and only best option.`
`Mion lent Keiichi her shoulder and quickly issued orders.`
`"Satoko, find our way out!! Rena, weapons!!"`
`"I'm already on it!!"`
`"This is all I could find...!"`
`Rena held up a sign prohibiting bicycle parking.`
` It would at least serve to frighten others if she swung it at them.`
`But their greatest weapon of all was the look in Rena's eyes, filled with her resolve to protect her friends.`
`Whenever Rena was prepared to defend something precious to her, she showed no mercy or hesitation.`
`Satoko used the talented observation skills she had when setting traps to rapidly calculate what to do.`
`If both forward and backward were blocked off, then they could only escape upward.`
`If they used the trash cans as a stool and climbed up on those eaves, then...`
`Ahh, but they couldn't!`
` Keiichi had sprained his leg.`
` There wasn't anything they could do without a ladder!!`
`"I-I'm fine! It's only temporary! This is nothing...!"`
`It certainly wasn't so bad that he couldn't walk.`
` It probably would heal quickly once he got some rest.`
`But that didn't mean he could hope to escape their current dire straits...!`
`"Why did you have to sprain your foot at a time like this?!! You really are a blockhead, Keiichi-san!! Aargh!! If only we had a ladder......!!"`
`"If you're just worried about me, I'll manage! So don't worry about me and climb up there!!"`
`"If you've got time to spout nonsense, then start praying that I find a ladder!!"`
`"Ooooooooooh!`
` God in Heaven!`
` Oyashiro-sama!!`
` Please bless us with a ladderrrrr!!"`
`"Haha! If praying'll save us, then I'll stick my belly button out and dance!"`
`"M-Mii-chan...!! A-A ladder...!!"`
`"Hwah?!"`
`There really was a ladder coming down from one of the eaves.`
`Looking up, there was a lone young girl lowering a stainless steel ladder with shaky hands.`
`They were usually pretty light, but it was plenty heavy for such a small girl.`
` There was a pretty good chance she'd lose her balance and fall down.`
`"Thank you!! It's good now, so let go!"`
`Rena took the ladder and quickly moved it into place.`
`"Kei-chan, can you climb?!"`
`"If I don't climb, then those other people are dying at Rena's hands."`
`"Thanks. We can avoid more needless deaths if you can climb. If you can."`
`Rena had already broken off parts of the wooden sign's frame, turning it into a sharp, pointed spear.`
`Her idea was on a whole different level from just waving it around to scare people.`
` It was both frightening and reassuring.`
`Still, nothing was better than taking the ladder.`
`"Thank you! I don't know who you are, but thank you very much!"`
`"......I suppose it is worth that."`
`"I'm good, I can climb..."`
`"I know, but hurry! They're almost here!!"`
`"There's more of those infected bastards!! A whole bunch, actually!!"`
`"Kill them! Kill them!!`
` Hyahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Shut up! If you're out to kill,`
` then you're prepared to be killed too, right?!"`
`"Rena-san, please climb!!"`
`Once Rena climbed up,`
` Mion quickly pulled up the ladder.`
`The young girl gestured to say it was okay to leave the ladder here,`
` before passing through the second floor window via the eaves.`
`Below them, the young rioters were spouting filthy curses`
` as they searched for a way to climb.`
`"This way. ......This place won't be safe forever, either."`
`"Seriously, thank you! You've saved our lives!"`
`"Are we going out through another window?"`
`"......There's no way those people won't, climb up here."`
`She exited through another window, then used an outdoor air condition unit as a stepping stone`
` to climb into the neighboring building through its own window.`
`Apparently she had been traveling along the second floor of the shopping district to avoid the dangerous streets below.`
`They continued moving like that from building to building and roof to roof`
` until they were certain they had managed to escape to a safe area......`
`They eventually stopped at the second floor of a shop-slash-residence.`
`Apparently that was her shelter.`
`"......We're okay. It looks like we shook them off."`
`"They just started searching for other prey. ......Those people just want to kill."`
`"It's like the streets are an ocean full of sharks......"`
`"......We're really thankful. You saved us."`
`"No one knows, if you're safe now or not."`
`"Well, we managed to escape that particular crisis, if nothing else. ......But I should thank you. So, thanks."`
`"I guess, I did earn your thanks."`
`"Heehee. ...Right."`
`She had no obligation to risk herself to try and save someone else.`
`If she was able to lock herself up tight indoors,`
` then her best option would have been to curl up and shut out all other sounds.`
`"I'm Maebara Keiichi. You?"`
`"Une..... is what people call me."`
`"I'm Rena. This is Mii-chan and Satoko-chan."`
`"Nice to meet you. You really did save us at the perfect time."`
`"You were lucky, but that doesn't mean you always will be."`
`"Well, luck is another kind of strength."`
`"Is it just you here, Une-chan? Any others?"`
`"There were. ......But they're not coming back."`
`If she stayed quiet she would be safe here.`
`Yet that's the sad nature of humanity.`
` Once they gain safety, they want to risk danger......`
`Whether it's wanting to make sure your family is safe, or to return home,`
` once a person finds safety, they can't just stay there......`
`The place certainly was a shelter.`
`There were a dozen plastic bottles full of water lined up,`
` and there were about four grocery bags stuffed full of candy bags laying there too.`
`They didn't know how many had been here, but as long as they were frugal, they could hole up for three days.`
`"When people manage to create a safe space... they want to bring their family and friends into it."`
`"That's true. Staying put here and ignoring what you hear outside might be the right answer. ......But thanks to Une-chan, we're all safe."`
`"I can't really thank you enough for saving our lives......"`
`"Are there still many more violent groups like that one?"`
`"There's more than that, there's plenty."`
`"Figures. Still, they're not running around in the middle of the night, right?"`
`"The neighborhood watch in Hinamizawa set up patrols after dark."`
`"They're frightened too. ...I do doubt they'll let their guard down and start snoring."`
`"Even so, it should be a little safer than moving in the middle of the day. The Sonozaki group's office isn't far, right?"`
`"...Well, not in terms of direct distance."`
`"We should wait and observe for a bit. There's no need to rush."`
`"That's true. Une-chan? Could you tell us a bit about what's going on in the city?"`
`"......Telling you, won't take that long..."`
`"Found it. It should open if I do this."`
`"Au, au. What'll we do if there's a terrifying ghost trapped in there?"`
`"Then you two can have a staring contest to determine which one's the stronger apparition."`
`"Rika!"`
`The strange, repetitive sound they heard was coming from the other side of a sturdy door, labeled the emergency storage room.`
`Someone was slamming themselves against the thick metal door.`
` That idea made the most sense, at least.`
`"But why the emergency storage room?"`
`"Maybe someone was using it as a jail cell..."`
`"Who? When? For whom?"`
`"Even I, Oyashiro-sama, don't know that!"`
`"I suppose that's true."`
`The door to the emergency storage room was the type being locked from the outside.`
`Given that something kept hitting it in there,  there was probably no way to unlock it from inside.`
`Once she came back with the master key, the sound stopped for a moment.`
`Maybe they were worn out from hitting it so much?`
` Either that, or they had gone quiet as Rika and Hanyuu approached, and were lying in wait for them.`
`"......I'm opening it."`
`"A-Anytime you're ready......"`
`She inserted the key, and slowly turned it......`
`There's no way`
` that an L5 patient was being kept quarantined in here, right?`
`If there was, then the moment she opened it`
` they could leap out from inside and start attacking her.`
`"That won't happen. ......There's no way Irie and the others would do something so senseless as locking a victim up in a place like this."`
`Even for the hundred-year-old witch, Rika,`
` it was hard to fight the curiosity of finding out what lay beyond that door.`
`She didn't have any interest in this crazy world.`
` But she could die at any time.`
`So she wanted to see what happened to the world up until the very end.`
`It wasn't some noble desire to watch over its demise,`
` but the slightly wicked curiosity of wanting to see something scary.`
`She slowly opened the heavy door......`
`Through the slight crack came the foul, hot scent of sweat mixed with something rotten.`
`The smell made her imagine something more filthy than frightening.`
`There was a light on inside......`
`And a sweaty man who was collapsed on the floor slowly raised his head......`
`"......Tomitake......"`
`"Hey...... Rika-chan...... ......You saved me........."`
`"What were you doing in a place like that?"`
`"Who knows. At the very least, it wasn't something I chose."`
`"Rika...... Look at the pipes in the back."`
`"......Handcuffs......"`
`Fastened to the pipes at the back of the storage room`
` were a pair of broken handcuffs.`
`He was almost certainly bound up in them before.`
`Just how long had he been held captive in there, though?`
`Judging from his surroundings,`
` it had to have been more than a day.`
`......It couldn't be.`
` Had he been locked up in there since this whole commotion started?`
`He was worn down and exhausted,`
` but it looked like he had just barely held onto his mind.`
`"By the way... has anything happened outside over the past few days?"`
`"Not much. ......In fact, it's finally quieted down."`
`"......Rika."`
`"The villagers expressed terminal symptoms one after another. Now it's spread beyond the village and into Okinomiya as well."`
`"That's terrible... W-What about Takano-san?!"`
`"......Speaking of her, I haven't seen her since this commotion started."`
`"Could you summon Director Irie here at once......? Something terrible's going to happen."`
`"Something terrible has already happened, and ended."`
`"No, something even more terrible is going to happen. Takano-san is planning to spread Hinamizawa Syndrome to all of Japan, no, the entire world...!!"`
`Apparently, it had all started several days back.`
`Tomitake had already been locked up in here`
` back when everything was peaceful, before anything had happened......`
`"......Nnh ......nh........."`
`"You awake...? Jirou-san."`
`He had been forced to breathe in from an ammonia bottle.`
`Tomitake's body wavered like heavy lead as he slowly looked up at Takano......`
`He tried to move his legs, but felt a cold, heavy sensation against them.`
`Looking down, there were handcuffs on his ankles that were fastened to the pipes.`
`"Takano-san...... What kind of joke is this......?"`
`"Joke? ......Heehee, heavens, no. This is truly a divine revelation."`
`"......What are you talking about.........?"`
`"I've been chosen by God. ......Yes. This was all a divine revelation......"`
`Takano's eyes looked like she was delirious with fever.`
`Though she herself was probably calmer than ever.`
`Still, to Tomitake's eyes, she looked like she was drunk on some strong liquor and caught up in a daydream......`
`"I wish you would calm down...... Could you explain this so I can understand?"`
`"......Yes. Thinking about it, it wouldn't be that hard to explain in a way you can understand. But I must tell you. Even if you don't understand what it means at all."`
`".........So you still want to tell me, then? ......I'm a little honored."`
`"Heehee. Thank you. For saying that. ......You really are a special person, Jirou-san."`
`"And you'd tie this special person up in a place like this?"`
`"I want you to stay here until the world is finished transforming into a new one."`
`"What are you plotting...?"`
`"No plot this time. It's a divine revelation. I've been chosen by God......!"`
`Tomitake wasn't a fool.`
`He had a vague idea of what Takano was plotting from that exchange.`
`"Don't tell me you're trying to cause something terrifying to occur, are you...?"`
`"There might be something terrifying indeed. But it's God's revelation. I have a feeling something wonderful is about to happen too."`
`"......You're not planning to take the virus we're researching out of here, are you?"`
`"Heehee, heehee. I'm positive that all of our research has been for the sake of this day. God has chosen me. He understands my noble purpose...!!"`
`"Stop it...!`
` I don't know who's instigated this, but that's not a divine revelation! It's the whisper of a devil!"`
`"A devil? What a cruel thing to say. ......Perhaps you can't see their divine glory? Well, of course you can't. You're just an average person. Heehee, heehee, heehee......"`
`Takano pulled something out of her pocket and tossed it to Tomitake.`
`It was a box with a syringe and a bottle of medicine.`
`He recognized it.`
` It was the new prophylactic for the Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`Though that was only supposed to be in development still......`
`"If... If you would like to witness the new world, then inject that into yourself. ......If you're fortunate, then you'll avoid an acute outbreak."`
`"Stop this!`
` You can still turn back from this! Talk this out with me! And undo these handcuffs first!"`
`Takano slowly lifted the attache case sitting at her feet.`
`It wasn't an ordinary attache case, though.`
` It was a special one, used to transport η173.`
`If she spread its contents through the air, then a wide range of people would contract Hinamizawa Syndrome,`
` eventually reach L5, and cause a terrifying disaster.`
`For Takano, researching the Syndrome was her way of proving her grandfather's great work to be true,`
` so it was a holy act, akin to worshipping god.`
` He knew that.`
`Yet an outbreak of Hinamizawa Syndrome`
` and the terrifying ruin that would bring about should not be her goal......`
`He couldn't even imagine what sort of delusions had come to possess her.`
`But she was prepared to do it.`
` ......Without hesitation.`
`"See you later, Jirou-san. If you're lucky, we'll meet again. ......Since this is an emergency storage room, you should find food and water within your reach."`
`"Knowing you, you'll be able to take care of those handcuffs too. Even if I lock this door from the outside, right?"`
`As long as he had time,`
` then Tomitake was certain he could break out of the handcuffs.`
`But that would grant Takano plenty of time to carry out her terrifying ambition......`
`"Wait! Hold on, Takano-san!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Are you planning to destroy the world?!"`
`"Heavens, no. ......I'm going to save humanity, as God has revealed to me. By letting his cute little children here fly free!"`
`"That's the whisper of the devil! You mustn't listen to it!!"`
`"I hear the devil is elsewhere."`
`"Huh?"`
`"The devil trying to destroy humanity has already appeared. ......God told me. And he told me I'm the only one who can stop it."`
`"What you're about to do really is the work of the devil! Don't let yourself be fooled by him!!"`
`"Don't worry. After all, God is always with me. ......Farewell. I'm going to Okinomiya. You're there, right?"`
`"Yes, I know. Heehee, heehee, ufufufufufu...... Hah hahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!"`
`"Wha... How could this be...? Auauau......"`
`"As expected, I guess. That woman never learns. ......So it's her fault again."`
`"We're too late......? What a disaster......"`
`Tomitake was captured right before the incident,`
` and had been shut inside here up until today.`
`It was all too late for him to do anything.`
` Takano had already spread the infection far beyond the village.`
`Maybe she's already spread it to the entire city or even the entire prefecture......`
`Tomitake shook his head many times as Rika described the present situation.`
`The reality was hard for him to accept,`
` but the gruesome sight of the researchers who murdered each other or took their own lives wouldn't permit him to consider otherwise.......`
`Tomitake entered the security room and started fiddling with the radio, but it didn't look like he was going to be able to contact anyone outside.`
`According to the emergency manual, in the event of an outbreak of Hinamizawa Syndrome,`
` they are to employ jamming waves throughout the region in order to prevent the spread of chaos.`
`Of course, the phone lines were down too.`
`So there was no way to get the crucial information about Takano's involvement to those outside......`
`"......Apparently they've already escalated to Hazard Level X2."`
`"What does that mean?"`
`"It means the Syndrome has spread to Shishibone City. At present the city is quarantined off from the outside, and all of the bridges have been blocked off. ......Hopefully Tokyo manages to do something with that time."`
`"So all we can do is wait?"`
`"Unfortunately, that's not the case. ......We can't leave Takano-san on the loose."`
`She had said,`
`"A devil has appeared to destroy humanity.`
` I'm heading to Okinomiya.`
` That's where you are, isn't it......?"`
`"I don't know what she's calling a devil, but..."`
`"......We can't afford to let her have her way any more than she already has, right?"`
`"That's right. ......Takano-san is most likely still within the city."`
`"If the bridges have been blocked off, then Takano can't get out either."`
`"If she's planning to take η173 and spread it beyond the city, then she can't afford to be captured. She should still be in Okinomiya."`
`"Tomitake. I'll help too."`
`"It's dangerous. You should hide down here."`
`"Right now Okinomiya is dangerous even for you, Tomitake."`
`"There are a lot of young people in Okinomiya...... They'll be much more dangerous after handing their heart over to the demon."`
`"I'm the queen carrier. If I'm not mistaken, I should have the power to calm down nearby infected."`
`"......Now that you mention it, I suppose that's true. ..............."`
`"Trying to be a gentleman toward me is less important than capturing Takano and preventing the further spread of harm."`
`"Still, if anything were to happen to you......"`
`"The worst possible outcome is already happening. Even if I were to die, things wouldn't get any worse than they already are."`
`Preventing this situation was exactly why they had to prevent disaster from befalling Rika.`
`But their worst fear - a mass outbreak of Level 5 symptoms - was already taking place without Rika's death.`
`......It made sense to him.`
` Logically, the situation couldn't worsen.`
`Besides, if Takano remained at large, it was likely that things would become even more disastrous.`
`Either she would spread Hinamizawa Syndrome throughout Japan,`
`or this thing she called a "devil" would move to interfere.`
`"If they're a devil for Takano... then the enemy of our enemy is our ally."`
`"......You have a point there. Alright. We don't have time to waste on debates."`
`"Don't stop me, Hanyuu. I'm doing this to save the world, you know?"`
`"Auau...... It looks like you're enjoying this......"`
`"Let's go, to find Takano-san!"`
`Tomitake borrowed a car parked at the clinic.`
`In this world not dissimilar from a zombie apocalypse, a car was the same as a moving shelter.`
` So long as no zombies sprang up from the back seat.`
`The car was heading into Okinomiya.`
`Rika and Hanyuu were relaxing in the back seat......`
`"I was planning to wait quietly for all of this to settle down back in Hinamizawa, but I've changed my mind. ......If this is Takano's plot, then I have to interfere."`
`"Still, what on earth could this 'devil' of hers be......?"`
`"Who knows. Maybe someone like us."`
`".............................."`
`"Hanyuu?"`
`".........Yes. ......Apparently it is someone like us."`
`"Huh?"`
`Though they had just been inside the car...`
` it felt like their souls were floating up out of their bodies.`
`Next thing they knew, Rika and Hanyuu found themselves in a strange, dreamlike world.`
`What was happening?`
` That sensation.........`
`Hanyuu's expression had grown solemn, like when she spoke of her past thousands of years ago......`
`That was when something akin to mist began to flicker and coalesce into human shape......`
`"W-What? Who......"`
`"......It's someone I hoped to never see again."`
`Even the hundred year witch, Rika, was left bewildered.`
`Because she had never heard Hanyuu utter those words before.`
`Someone Hanyuu never wanted to see again......`
`Human-shaped mist......`
` An inhuman being taking human form.`
`"......To think we should meet again, Tamurahime-no-Mikoto......"`
`"Leader of the horned people, Hanyuu...... I have had no desire to meet with you once more."`
`"I could return those exact same words. ......Why must I see you like this again......?"`
`"......You aren't usually so hostile."`
`"We are enemies, who refuse to accept one another. You must not trust her."`
`"I guess you monsters hate your own kind."`
`"I will not permit you to call me the same as that demon hiding her horns. Know your place, priestess of the horned people."`
`Rika got a sudden headache from her sharp gaze.`
`Her hardened eyes carried not only supernatural power, but enough rejection and scorn to cause physical pain......`
`......Thinking back, Rika had only ever received constant respect.`
`No matter how many hundreds of deaths or years she had lived through...`
` she had never faced down such a hostile gaze before.`
`Rika could only gulp hard, in the face of that......`
`"Hanyuu. ......Do you understand why I have appeared before you?"`
`"..........................."`
`"What do you make of this disaster below us?"`
`Slowly the mist cleared beneath their feet.`
`Finally Rika understood.`
` They weren't inside mist, but inside a cloud.`
`Below them was a sight like one might see from an airplane.`
`Even without straining their eyes, they could tell the city of Okinomiya was below......`
`Black smoke rose from various points in the city,`
` and they could see a dark haze hanging over it.`
`When they focused their eyes even more`
` they could see the people who gave their hearts over to the demons killing each other in the streets......`
`"What an awful sight...... Shudder with the weight of your own sin. All of this is the work of your kind. Know shame, leader of the horned people."`
`"..................! ........."`
`From the perspective of humans like Rika, Takano was at fault.`
`But from the perspective of inhuman beings like Hanyuu...`
` the disaster below was all Hanyuu's fault.`
`After all, η173 was Hanyuu. It was the horned people.`
`Hanyuu bit her bottom lip, unable to refute her claims.`
`Takano had conducted the research to turn the horned people ferocious.`
`Hanyuu wasn't to blame for that.`
` But that being said, these inhuman beings wouldn't allow a human to be blamed for that sin.`
`"......We shall take responsibility... with our own hands."`
`"You will not. That is unnecessary now. Know that your tainted horned people will not be allowed to corrupt our lands any further."`
`"That's quite the rude statement, coming from someone who's as much of a monster."`
`"Silence. Know your place, child of man. You are but the priestess of the tainted horned people."`
`"Kh......"`
`Rika's head throbbed with pain again when Tamurahime-no-Mikoto glanced at her.`
`There was no doubt she was the same as Hanyuu,`
` but it was no longer even necessary to explain that the two were beings at total odds with one another.`
`"I never wish to speak to you again by any means. ......I, the leader of the horned people, and my priestess shall take responsibility for ending this tragedy."`
`"You will not. Go home, tainted one. I shall take responsibility for resolving the disaster brought upon my people's lands. You should return to your land of Hinamizawa and be ashamed of your immature charges! Now be gone, Hanyuu and priestess!"`
`A violent shock shook her body, and the very next moment she had returned to the back seat of the car.`
`It was all like a daydream.`
` However, it was undoubtedly real for them.`
`That had been the cold reunion between inhuman beings after centuries, or possibly even millennia.`
`"......Who on earth was that?"`
`"Tamurahime-no-Mikoto. ......The leader of the previous residents, who ruled these lands before we ever arrived here."`
`"I see. So there's no reason you'd get along, then."`
`"We were refugees, and it was a miracle that we finally reached this land. It was an incredible blessing to us. ...Yet we were coldly rejected by Tamura."`
`That was something that had never been recorded, even in the most ancient documents within the ritual storehouse.`
` ......It was truly the oldest of myths, known only to Hanyuu.`
`"We wandered space for a long time in search of a place to live peacefully. ......After a journey so long it could drive one mad, we finally made it to this beautiful blue planet."`
`"......Just what on Earth are you people? ......I've always wondered that. You're certainly not some abstract being like a god. You're something that Irie and the others could have studied under a microscope, aren't you?"`
`The cause of the Hinamizawa Syndrome was a virus.`
` But there's no way a virus could be sentient......`
`Yet it seemed to be the true identity of Hanyuu's horned people.`
`Rika's guess was correct.`
`Some science fiction stories have posed the idea that humanity is nothing more than a parasite upon Earth.`
`So in that sense, the horned people are no different from humans.`
`Humans are parasites upon the Earth.`
` And they are parasites upon the human brain.`
`Which means that to the horned people,`
` the human brain is their land.`
`If humanity continues to destroy the environment,`
` then eventually it will kill the Earth, and everything living upon it will die along with it.`
`That's why humanity must be kind to Earth and strive to live in harmony with it.`
`The same goes for the horned people.`
`If they cannot coexist with humanity, they will cease to exist at all.`
`......In that analogy, Hinamizawa Syndrome is their destruction of the environment.`
`When the human becomes paranoid and mad,`
` resorting to self-injury, acts of violence, or suicide,`
` then the horned people die with them.`
`Once her reasoning reached that point, Rika finally understood a bit of what Tamura had said at the end,`
` calling them immature.`
`......Tamurahime-no-Mikoto was, most likely,`
` the leader of another supernatural parasite upon humanity.`
`Yet aside from the Hinamizawa Syndrome,`
` she had never heard any report of similar symptoms anywhere else in Japan.`
`Which meant that Tamura's race of people had obtained a means of coexisting peacefully with humanity.`
`However, Hanyuu's horned people had yet to obtain that same skill.`
` ......That's why they were declared immature.`
`Still, you can argue otherwise as well.`
`Sure, there was a disaster in Onigafuchi Village back in ancient times.`
`Yet they have spent many decades`
` developing unique practices to control themselves and prevent any symptoms.`
`But then a villain, Takano, came and interfered,`
` intentionally conducting research to turn them into a deadly virus.`
`This incident in Hinamizawa wasn't caused by Hanyuu or the horned people.`
`This whole commotion was caused by Takano developing η173,`
` a new race of ferocious horned people, and spreading them elsewhere.`
`"It doesn't look like that stubborn monster is capable of understanding."`
`"She never listens to anyone. She's always just cold and inflexible."`
`"From her point of view, we're no different from the virus Takano spread, and thus equally guilty. But from our perspective, it's all Takano's fault. ......She's the one who caused this great disaster. I won't be able to calm down until I punch that woman in the face."`
`"......I just hope Tamura doesn't get in our way."`
`It would seem the land of Hinamizawa was the land of the horned people,`
` while all the other lands belonged to Tamura's people.`
`......Just what is Tamura's people......?`
`Also, if she's also a human parasite...`
` does that mean everyone in Japan is......?`
`"We're about to come up on the town. ......I don't know what we'll find here, so be careful."`
`"I know. I'll use Oyashiro's power to make sure none of the bad people come to us."`
`"It'd be better if we never have to test that power of yours at all. Hahaha."`
`"Tomitake. ......How do you plan to hunt down Takano in a town this large?"`
`"Right now, Okinomiya is a dangerous town for Takano-san too. Even if she has brought a handgun along, it won't be enough to really protect her."`
`The Mountain Dogs were annihilated.`
` Right now Takano was nothing more than a lone woman.`
`She wouldn't be able to last if she was attacked by the murderers wandering around with their terminal symptoms.`
`"She's probably taking shelter with a colony of evacuees. ......Well, it's still dizzying to think about hunting her down. If you're able to use your powers to uncover Takano-san, that would be perfect, hahaha."`
`"Can you do it, Hanyuu?"`
`"......If I could, I already would be. Auau."`
`"Another possibility would be finding a means of contacting people outside of here. If we're able to contact Tokyo, then we'll have plenty of options."`
`The reassuring thing about Tomitake was that he could act like normal, completely unfazed, even in emergencies like this.`
`That was probably thanks to the effects of the new prophylactic Takano had administered.`
`"......I don't know what Takano's thinking. Why did she let Tomitake live? ......She should've predicted that he'd become her most difficult adversary in this situation."`
`"Even after living a thousand years, there is still the occasional human completely beyond comprehension. ......She's one of those people."`
`"True. The one thing we can be sure of is that if we let her have her way, then disaster will spread to all of Japan, no, all the world."`
`"I wonder, if that happens will all the monsters of this world claiming to be gods come to ream you out?"`
`"......Auauau."`
`"Takano was talking about wanting to become a god herself. Then there's you and that Tamurahime-no-Mikoto. ......I see. The human world doesn't have a say in this matter anymore."`
`Most likely...`
` If Hanyuu is to be called a god, then there must be a disturbance in their world.`
`Humans have just been caught up in their mess.`
`......The more I think about it, the more I realized we're the only ones who can stop this incident.`
`".........From what I can see, the office of the Sonozaki Group still seems to be safe......"`
`Mion and the others had traveled along the building's wall, stopping at one point to pick up some opera glasses`
` to use them as binoculars.`
`After a bit of surveillance, they had a good idea of what actions they could take near the walls`
` as well as the movements of the surrounding rioters.`
`"Figures they'd be behaving the same as Hinamizawa's neighborhood watch."`
`"Generally they take up positions hiding behind the barricades, but every time they hear something, they shout and race toward it in a rampage."`
`"It's ridiculous that they think they're acting reasonably......"`
`"But now we know their behavior patterns. It also means they were at their hottest back when we first ran into them."`
`"It's not like they're, racing around all the time."`
`"Right. For us that's big news all on its own."`
`"Either way, we'll be unable to do anything without crossing this river."`
`"We can't go any further, without crossing."`
`"So we go quietly, or we go loudly. One or the other."`
`"Let's use the cover of night to sneak across.`
` They'll probably set up watches, but it'll still be easier than in broad daylight."`
`"I'd rather we take action before your injury gets any worse, Mion. ...You sure you're still doing okay?"`
`"Heh heh, don't count this ol' man out. A scratch like this is nothing...`
`Ah, ow, ow, ow?!"`
`Mion raises her arm like she's not the least bit concerned, but there's no way a gunshot wound could heal in less than a day or two.`
`The only thing keeping Mion moving is her own sheer physical and mental strength.`
`The bleeding has stopped thanks to some amateur first aid, but it's still a wound that needs proper treatment from a medical professional.`
`"Don't push yourself too hard, okay?"`
`"I-it's fine, it's fine. A wound this small can't stop Sonozaki blood."`
`"If the blood doesn't stop, then we've got a serious problem."`
`"Well, I'm sure we can give it a more proper treatment once we get to the office. So we just need to hold out a little longer."`
`"So, even if it takes time, we definitely need to get to the office."`
`"What are you going to do, Une-chan......?"`
`"You coming with us? It'll probably be a little lonely here waiting for help that may never come."`
`"........................"`
`"......Everyone else said the same thing before leaving and getting killed, didn't they? ......I can understand how you feel."`
`"It's not like, I don't want to leave here because it's scary."`
`"......Do you trust us?"`
`"It's, not that I don't. The more I watch you all in action, the less it feels dangerous to stay with you."`
`"Every one of our club members is strong individually, but together, we're invincible!"`
`"If you're willing to trust us, then we'll definitely protect you."`
`"Though that assumes some guarantee that the Sonozaki Group's office is safer than it is here."`
`"That's not an issue. They keep all kinds of emergency reserves in there so they can hole up if anything bad happens."`
`"Your family is seriously good at preparing for things."`
`"Kukuku. Our family's policy is to finish fights by the time they start."`
`"We owe you for saving us, Une-san. So we'll repay that debt to you."`
`"We'll make sure to bring you somewhere safe."`
`"......It's not like, I'm happy."`
`That little girl was stuck all alone in this unprecedented disaster.`
` Of course she'd be anxious.`
`At first we thought she was silent and expressionless,`
` but she was slowly opening up to our energetic club members.`
`This young girl wasn't originally the silent type.`
`She'd just closed her heart off a bit`
` in order to protect it from the shock of this disaster.`
`"Where's your home, Une-chan?"`
`"......It's not like, I lived in this town."`
`"Huh? Then where is your home?!"`
`"Don't tell me you got caught up this mess while hanging out with someone in Okinomiya...?"`
`"........................"`
`"That's...... You must have been real worried......"`
`"Is it far from here?"`
`"......It's, not close. ......But all the bridges are broken and I can't get home......"`
`"I see..."`
`"That's so sad......"`
`"But there's one fortunate thing about that."`
`"......Right, I suppose there is."`
`"It means that your family's not caught in this uproar. So they're all safe. Isn't that right?"`
`"..................... ......That's right."`
`That was the one saving grace for her.`
`She knew for certain that her family and her home were safe.`
`The government had destroyed all the tunnels and bridges leading into Shishibone City,`
` so it was physically cut off.`
`That basically meant they were admitting that it would at least take time to determine a solution for this problem.`
`On the other hand though,`
` since they went that far, they were also able to keep the damage from spreading beyond the city.`
`Those living in the city were probably depressed or enraged, believing that the government had abandoned them,`
` but in terms of the big picture, that was the right call.`
`Thanks to that decision, Une's home was safe.`
`......She still had hope.`
`That was how she was able to keep going this long...`
` even amidst crushing despair.`
`Once we understood what she was going through, we all looked down for a moment,`
` and then clenched our fists with a growing sense of purpose.`
`"If you hadn't rescued us, who knows what would have happened to us."`
`"It's very likely that some of us would have died."`
`"The debt we owe you for saving our lives... can't be called a cheap one!"`
`"Yeah, that's right, Une-chan. ......Us club members will do everything within our power to ensure you make it home!"`
`"Th`
` ......Thank you......`
` .........for that............"`
`"Operation Crossing will commence tomorrow morning at 4 AM! We'll use the cover of night to cross the main street in one go, and reach the office! I'll be taking the lead and scouting ahead to prepare for the worst! I don't want to think about it, but we can't deny the possibility that everyone in the office has gone crazy too."`
`While Mion warned us about that,`
` she seemed confident it wasn't the case.`
`She was probably able to confirm they retained their sanity`
` when she was observing the office with the opera glasses.`
`We all went to bed early so we'd be in top condition.`
`Satoko set a trap to detect intruders,`
` but it was hard to sleep while fearing the sound of that empty can.`
`.........Even so, I definitely fell asleep at some point.`
`Then, I woke up to Mion poking me......`
`"It's time to get up."`
`"Mmn...... ...Oh, yeah...... I'm surprised you woke up on time without any alarms......"`
`"Mii-chan said she didn't sleep."`
`"You were the one who slept soundest of us all. Good grief, how bold."`
`".........It should be pitch black, but it isn't."`
`"You're right. Moonlight is surprisingly bright."`
`If it really was the moonlight, it might have been a bit romantic.`
`The traffic lights and other illumination were still on, lighting up the city without rest.`
`Unlike Hinamizawa, Okinomiya never had nights of pitch black darkness.`
`I didn't know if we should consider that fortunate or disadvantageous for our stealth.`
`Occasionally there were glimpses of light from flashlights`
` on the main street, filled with rows of unoccupied vehicles.`
`They had set up a watch, just as we predicted.`
`But regardless,`
` their guard was still thinner than it was in broad daylight.`
`"......Okay. We can do this......"`
`"......We're going, to be okay, aren't we......?"`
`"Just leave it to us. There's nothing to fear. We'll cross it easily."`
`"We have our secret weapon, too."`
`"I hope we manage to do this quietly. If we rush in and make a lot of noise, we'll cause issues for those in the office too."`
`"That's true."`
`From our reconnaissance, it looked like the Sonozaki Office was cutting off all contact with the outside.`
`They had set up barricades,`
` and they weren't interacting with the rioters at all.`
`If they had surrendered their hearts to demons like the rioters had,`
` then they wouldn't be setting up defenses, and they'd be fully participating in the hunt for infected.`
`But if we were to rush in there while being chased by rioters,`
` then they'd say that the Sonozaki Group is harboring the infected, and end up causing an uproar.`
`We had to strive for complete stealth.`
`Une slowly unlocked the door leading outside.`
`Opening that door here in Okinomiya, where the streets were basically an ocean teeming with sharks,`
` meant facing the same fear as trying to step into a lion's cage......`
`"It's not like, I'm not afraid......"`
`"I'll take the lead. ......If I fail, retreat quickly, just as we planned. Don't even think about trying to save me. Got it?!"`
`".........That goes both ways. If I sprain my foot again, abandon me."`
`"We really will this time, so be careful, Keiichi-kun."`
`"Yeah!"`
`"The operation will now begin! If something happens, leave it to me."`
`Satoko was carrying a radio controlled car she borrowed from somewhere on the second floor.`
`She tested moving it in a straight line with the remote controls,`
` then set it up to drag an empty can fastened behind it.`
`It could be our decoy if the worst happened.`
` However, that sound would draw unwanted attention.`
`It wasn't a trump card to help us reach the office, it was a trump card to buy us a chance to retreat if the operation failed.`
`The success rate of Mion's operation was roughly 95%.`
` But we still couldn't bring the chance of failure down to zero.`
`It was Mion's policy to imagine all possibilities and prepare for each one of them, so to ensure that the worst possible outcome not catch them off guard,`
` she gave the go-sign to Satoko's remote control plan.`
`"I'm heading out. ......Make sure you stay a fair bit away from me."`
`We carefully opened the door, and once we were certain enough that everything was quiet around us...... Mion slipped outside.`
`......Unlike Hinamizawa, everything in Okinomiya was covered in concrete, so even the faintest sounds echoed.`
`If you stepped on a small rock on the asphalt, you could hear it from rather far away.`
`"......Well...... it might be better going barefoot......"`
`Mion took off her shoes.`
`No matter how carefully we walked, the hard rubber soles couldn't silence the sound of pebbles scraping asphalt.`
`Even with socks on, it would hurt a city kid to walk on the surface barefoot.`
`But for us Hinamizawa kids who always chased each other around, climbing trees barefoot, walking on asphalt with no shoes was nothing.`
`"It's time to see whether or not Keiichi-san, our former city kid, can tolerate going barefoot."`
`"I've trained myself up a lot by now. Don't take me lightly."`
`"Une-chan, are you okay going barefoot......?"`
`"......It hurts......"`
`"I'm sorry. Just bear with it for a little while, okay......?"`
`Mion poked her head out of the alley,`
` and checked on the 'river' with rows of unoccupied cars.`
`It was too easy to see across the wide sidewalk.`
` We'd have to cut across it in one go and duck behind the row of cars.`
`The self-proclaimed watch`
` also realized that clear view meant it was the best place for keeping a lookout.`
`We could see them shining a beam of light straight down the sidewalk every now and then with their flashlights.`
`......They were excessively frightened, and were seeking out an enemy.`
`If they sensed even the slightest presence, they'd cause a lot of noise and summon their friends.`
`".........This is good. I've been looking for a thrill like this."`
`Mion boldly licked up the sweat trailing down her nose`
` and smiled.`
`She used hand signs to signal her friends to wait and calculated her timing.`
`......The watch's lights were restless.`
`They wandered back and forth, glancing everywhere in fidgety motions.`
`Their fear left them needing to light up every shadow.`
`So that anxiety created plenty of openings......`
`Now.........`
`Quick and nimble, like a cat.`
` Mion dashed across the sidewalk and ducked into the row of cars.`
`It went so quickly and easily that all her prior tension seemed misplaced.`
`Keiichi and the other heaved a heavy sigh of relief as they watched from the shadows.`
`Keiichi, the second one up, was about to follow after her,`
` but Mion gave them the sign to hold.`
`It looked like she wanted to carefully cross the river of cars and check out the sidewalk on the opposite bank.`
`"......Shoot...... That's bad......"`
`When she had scouted it from the roof right before commencing the operation, there wasn't anyone over there.`
`But at some point three men from the watch had taken up posts on the opposite shore.`
`......They were heading right towards her.`
`She wasn't exposed just yet.`
` They were just walking around shining lights randomly at the cars.`
`Mion calmly found a truck with a high frame and slid underneath it......`
`It's okay, it's okay......`
` They haven't spotted us.`
`If they had noticed us, would they be walking so carelessly......?`
`Even if she was 99% certain she was safe...`
` she could feel herself sweating.`
`......Pathetic, Sonozaki Mion.`
` To think I'd be sweating this badly over a little hide and seek......`
`"Make sure you don't overlook any infected......"`
`"All their brains are damaged. Plus, they'll try to bite us and spread the virus further."`
`You're the ones with damaged brains, though.`
` Mion smirked.`
`Still, once their feet stopped in front of the truck she hid under,`
` her smile froze.`
`"D-Did they find her...?!"`
`"......We're, we're done for........."`
`"Calm down. ......They're not acting like they have."`
`"They're getting in?"`
`The men from the watch climbed up into the bed of the truck Mion had hid under.`
`Apparently there were folding chairs or something inside the truck bed.`
` The men then sat down on them.`
`Which meant the men had taken position directly above Mion.`
` She was practically a bug pinned in place......`
`"Hey...... Seriously......?"`
`Sweat dripped from Mion's forehead.`
`Keiichi and the others understood the situation just as well.`
` Mion couldn't move at all.`
`There was no guaranteeing they wouldn't hear anything when she crawled out from under the truck.`
` Not only that, but Mion couldn't see what was going on above her at all.`
`Even if she were able to slip out without making a sound,`
` there was no guarantee they wouldn't happen to look around and catch sight of her.`
`......Mion couldn't move from there until they left that post......`
`"I-It's not like I know, what to do......"`
`"Is it finally time for our secret weapon?!"`
`"Only as a last resort. We could save Mion, but that would cause way too much noise...!"`
`"Still, get it ready."`
`Satoko nodded, set her remote controlled car on the sidewalk, and fastened the empty can to it.`
`Once we let it loose, it was sure to draw their attention.`
`"Either way, the operation's failed. We need to create an opening for Mion to make her escape. It'll be better to try again later."`
`"......I agree. We just had bad timing. Let's try again."`
`The club members knew exactly when to pull out thanks to our many dangerous club activities.`
`Naturally, Mion was thinking the same thing.`
` Keiichi and the others would probably create a chance for her to escape.`
` She'd have to slip out in that moment.`
`......Still, they had to wait for a time.`
`There was still a chance the men in the bed above her would stand back up and go off somewhere else.`
`Even if they manage to retreat,`
` causing an uproar now would make it even more difficult to cross the river a second time.`
`Even though Mion practically had a pin pushed through her heart,`
` we had to stay calm and wait for our chance at victory......`
`"We should get Une-chan back to safety first."`
`She wasn't used to being barefoot.`
` She might have trouble running full tilt if it came down to that.`
`"Keiichi-kun, take Une-chan and secure our retreat. Satoko-chan, watch my back."`
`"Leave it to me. Keiichi-san, you've got a great responsibility!"`
`"I know. I'll leave this to you two. Let's go, Une-chan...!"`
`"Y, Yes......"`
`Keiichi took Une and left for the time being.`
`......He thought he'd faced death in Hinamizawa.`
` But Hinamizawa was full of nothing but old people.`
` Plus they had a homeground advantage there.`
`But they were playing an away game under different rules in Okinomiya.`
`"If I'd known this was going to happen, I would've played around here more......"`
`"Hahh, hahh, hahh......"`
`Une was panting.`
`No one could blame her.`
` Things were so tense.`
` Her breathing was ragged from both exhaustion and fear.`
`"Let's rest a moment and catch our breath."`
`"Th...... Thank...... you...... Hahh...... hahh......"`
`While Une calmed her breathing,`
` Keiichi sharpened his senses and searched for anyone nearby.`
`......He sensed one.`
`"Not good...... Someone's coming."`
`"Huh......?!"`
`"I hear several footsteps. It's the watch. ....................."`
`There was hardly anywhere to hide.`
` If they screwed up and got caught, then their escape route would be cut off.`
` They couldn't take any risks.`
`There were no other streets.`
` They had to turn back and pray the men went somewhere else.`
`But the main street was the primary artery for their watch circuit.`
` There was a high probability they would head directly toward Rena and the others.`
`"Let's head back. We can't run into them here."`
`"W-We're going back, again......? A-Attacking us from both sides......"`
`"That might happen. Anyway, let's head back...!"`
`Keiichi's prediction was spot on.`
` They didn't go down any other street, and headed straight for the main road.`
`There were four young men about college age carrying bent metal bats.`
`At this rate, they'd attack Rena and the others from the rear.`
`"We're pincered in? That's bad......"`
`"Well, isn't this interesting? I hardly thought I'd get to feel as much suspense as I do during club activities."`
`"There's no way back. So then what do we do?"`
`"Y-You don't mean...... ......do you......?"`
`"If we can't go back, then we have to go forward!"`
`"......We'll have to use our remote control trap to draw the enemy's attention ......and then seize that chance to advance."`
`It was a dangerous strategy.`
` We'd probably be able to get out of this pinch...`
`But once they start shouting, the rest of the watch will all wake up at once.`
`If we get unlucky enough to run into them on our way forward,`
` then we'll be trapped like rats.`
`If it's just two or three people, then we can handle them somehow with our club members' full might.`
`But if the uproar brings a huge crowd chasing after us, then we'll just be kids, unable to fight back.`
`Still, even with a few misfortunes thrown our way, this wasn't a game with no chance of victory.`
`"Satoko-chan, ready your trap......"`
`"Ready whenever you are."`
`"Sidewalk's clear. We can cross now...!"`
`"Go! Satoko-chan, do it!"`
`"Leave it to me!"`
`"Let's go, Une-chan...! Run!"`
`"It's not, like I can't run!"`
`We all crossed at once and ducked into the row of cars.`
`But there was no way to prevent the men in the truck from noticing our dash.`
`The moment they looked over to see what it was, Satoko's remote control trap activated.`
`The car dragged the empty can fastened to it, making a loud metal noise as it raced down the sidewalk.`
`"W-What?! What's that sound?!"`
`"They're running!`
` After them!!`
` It has to be the infected!!"`
`Their paranoia and fear turned into violent aggression and anger.`
`The men in the truck leapt onto car roofs and car hoods, chasing after the loud remote control car.`
`The silence of night was shattered, with angry cries and whistles blasting from here and there.`
` The city's madness was awakened.`
`But Mion was released from her prison under the truck.`
`"What are you doing?! It's still too early for that!"`
`"We were pincered! We had to set it off!"`
`"Une-san, time to show us what you're made of!"`
`"Hahh, hahh, hahh...!!"`
`"We can't go back! There's more coming that way!"`
`One after another, rioters with bloodshot eyes dashed out of the alley everyone had just been hiding in.`
`There must have been a building or something housing them all nearby.`
`The option of turning back and returning to safety was cut off.`
` We had to move forward.`
`"If we have to go forward, then forward we go! There's not much distance left."`
`"I just pray the Sonozaki Group hasn't forgotten what you look like."`
`"Hahahaha, Kei-chan, you sure say some funny things!"`
`"Don't let your guard down! We can't relax until we've made it inside the Sonozaki Group's office!"`
`"Agreed. There's still a chance Shion-san might say, 'who the heck are you, plbbt!'"`
`"True. More importantly, Mion, don't forget your promise to belly dance for us. You said you would when Une-chan lowered that ladder!"`
`"Ihihi, Did I say that?"`
`"Hahh, hahh, hahh...!!"`
`"Une-chan, hang in there! Just a little further!"`
`"It's right around that corner!`
`......Huh?!"`
`I think Mion completely let her guard down.`
`All we had left was to cut the tape at the finish line after our final spurt.`
` I'm sure that's what she thought.`
`But the finish line wasn't something we could cut through.`
`"Huhhhh?! W-What's going on?!"`
`"W-What is this?!"`
`The street was sealed off with barbed wire mesh.`
`Either the Sonozaki Group did it to secure their safety in front of their office,`
` or the rioters did it to keep infected from coming through, but we didn't know which.`
`Regardless, the reality was that the street was blocked off, with the office right in front of us.`
`If we had known about this barricade ahead of time, our strategy would have been greatly different.`
`We could only call it bad luck.`
` It was in a perfect blind spot from the angle Mion had when scouting it with the opera glasses.`
`And that slight blindspot unfortunately brought a second misfortune with this barricade!`
`It wasn't impossible to climb over it if you were prepared to hurt yourself on the barbed wire.`
`But we couldn't force that on Une, who didn't have the resolve of us club members.`
`"Alternate routes?!"`
`"T-T-There's one! If we swing around from the alley across...!!"`
`That was when bright beams of light shone upon us all.`
`"Who are you all?!!"`
`"Whooooa! There! It's the infected!!"`
`Our blood froze.`
` We were finished.`
`Une couldn't bear the fear any longer, and let out a piercing scream......`
`We were out of options.`
` Our opponents had us beaten in build, ferocity, and numbers as well.`
`The rioters gathered together one after another...... surrounding us and trapping us in the barricaded alley......`
`That was when several dry shots rang out.`
`Mion quickly shouted, "Down!" and pushed our heads to the ground.`
`The rioters, who didn't recognize the sound of gunshots, stood there bewildered.`
`"Gentlemen,`
` that's enough!`
` Unlawful lynching is unacceptable, no matter the circumstance!!"`
`It was the sound of Tomitake firing into the air with a submachine gun he took out of the Irie Institution's security room.`
`Maybe the rioters thought it was just a model gun or something,`
` but they showed no fear, and only glared at Tomitake for interrupting their hunt.`
`With Okinomiya's medical facilities paralyzed right now, even a shot to the leg could prove fatal.`
`Tomitake didn't want to shoot, but he gulped as the rioters proved unfazed......`
`"I don't want to shoot you all...!"`
`"Leave this to me. ......Hanyuu!"`
`"Comrades of mine...... calm your spirits...... I am Oyashiro-sama, your leader...!"`
`Hanyuu's stern words rang out solely for inhuman ears.`
`The rioters stopped and stood still, their mouths wide open.`
`Eventually they sat down directly on the ground and waited absentmindedly.`
`Even if Takano had modified them to be more ferocious, they were still Hanyuu's brethren.`
` They couldn't escape the power of her words.`
`The eyes of Mion and the others went wide with shock, but they realized this was their narrow chance to get out alive.`
`"Everyone, go now......!"`
`"W-What's this...? What's going on?!"`
`"It's Oyashiro Power, nipah☆"`
`"Thank you for rescuing us, Rika-chan! Tomitake-san!"`
`"We heard the commotion. We made the right choice rushing over. What were you all doing out here?"`
`"The office of the Sonozaki Group is just beyond here."`
`"We weren't aware of the barricade and got cornered like rats."`
`"Pathetic! You cut it that close with my Sis on your side?"`
`"Shion!"`
`Shion, Kasai, and a few other men in black outfits approached from behind the barricade.`
`Every one of them carried a gun, but none of them had the ferocious expressions of the rioters.`
`Seems the Sonozaki Group had retained their sanity and focused on holing up inside.`
`"Please, give us break, will you? We don't want to get involved with those crazies."`
`"We're sorry for causing such a stir."`
`"If you're safe, Shion-san, then we have nothing to fear anymore."`
`"That's right. I'm more reliable than ten of my sister, all by myself. Kasai, open it for them."`
`"Come in, everyone."`
`Kasai unlocked the padlock on the chains securing the barricade's doors shut.`
`"Still, what on earth is going on? What happened to them?"`
`"What, on earth......"`
`"You don't need to worry about them. If you leave them alone, they'll eventually wander off."`
`"Now, now! Why don't we just appreciate this chance granted to us through Oyashiro-sama's miracles? Hahaha!"`
`"Come on, Une-chan, you're safe now!"`
`"There's nothing to worry about now that we have Shion-sama with us too!"`
`"That's right. Satoko understands, at least. ......By the way, who's this girl?"`
`".........H-Hello, there......"`
`"She's Une-chan. She saved our lives!"`
`"......What's the matter, Hanyuu?"`
`"........................"`
`"....................."`
`"......You are............"`
`We all slipped through the barricade and were welcomed into the Sonozaki Group's office.`
`Yet that sight...`
` was being observed from far away through binoculars......`
`".........Heeheehee. ......I found you. ......That's the girl......"`
`The Sonozaki Group's office had been turned into a shelter for the local residents.`
`We could see the townsfolk lying down here and there, huddled under blankets.`
`"You could say that the Sonozaki Group is this region, after all. Under my Mom's orders, we've been taking in people with nowhere else to go since the chaos started."`
`"What do you mean people with nowhere to go?"`
`"She means people just like Une-chan. Those that came here for work, or visited for pleasure. There are a lot of people from outside of Okinomiya that got caught up in this mess."`
`"The 'watch' went after those with nowhere else to go first. We could've fought against them, but Akane-san ordered us to avoid that."`
`So after securing as many people as they could,`
` they built up their surroundings with those barricades`
` to limit their contact with the watch and prevent any further trouble.`
`To the watch, all outsiders were the infected.`
` If they knew so many outsiders were being sheltered here, there would be big trouble.`
`"......Is this place safe?"`
`"I can guarantee it's the safest place in Okinomiya. The community center was the main shelter at first, but that place has collapsed, so this is what's left."`
`"Collapsed?"`
`"You know what they say about too many cooks. What started as just fighting over leadership lead to murder. .....It's terrifying."`
`"I see. ......The leadership here is solid, so you've managed to establish order and keep people from handing their hearts over to the demons......"`
`"Impressive. So are the police and such still operating then?"`
`"They're scattered across the city responding to riots... and there are lies going around that they're harboring infected......"`
`"This situation's beyond anything the police were prepared for. There's no way they could handle it."`
`"That said, you were brave out there, Tomitake! Where did you get such a wonderful gun?"`
`"Well, I just happened to pick it up? Hahahaha...!!"`
`"You know, that's not one amateurs could handle. ......You're a man of many mysteries."`
`"......Rika? ......Rika?"`
`"What's the matter? Huh? Rika-chan's not here? Une-chan's gone too."`
`"I thought I saw those two talking over there just a moment ago."`
`"What do you mean, Hanyuu? What's your issue with this girl?"`
`"............Quiet. I'm speaking to her right now."`
`"..........................."`
`"What are you saying? ......Who on earth is this Une girl?"`
`The sound of a tuning fork`
` echoed in Rika's head.`
`The tone gradually changed, almost like it was being, well, tuned.`
`......Rika understood.`
` This was a conversation between inhuman beings.`
`It was like they were using a radio.`
`They were searching for the right wavelength to allow mutual conversation.`
`Which meant ......This Une girl had to be.........`
`"......This is Hanyuu, leader of the horned people. ......Who are you.........?"`
`"................................."`
`That was when both tones began to resonate.`
`A bright light enveloped everything......`
`The moment that light cleared away, Rika, Hanyuu, and Une were floating in the world of inhuman beings.`
`The eyes of the young girl named Une occasionally took on the same the light that dwelled within Hanyuu's.`
`I was certain.`
` This girl...... was someone like me and Hanyuu.`
` ......Some inhuman being.`
`Hanyuu stared long into Une's eyes,`
` waiting for her response......`
`"I, am Une. ......I am, afraid......"`
`"There's nothing to fear. We have no intention of fighting anyone. What people do you come from?"`
`".............................."`
`What followed in response wasn't words,`
` but something conducted through telepathy.`
`Various images were practically forced into Rika's head,`
` like she was being compelled to daydream.`
`The ocean of stars in space.`
` ......Her blue Earth shining in the distance.`
`Apparently, Une was something that had only recently arrived on Earth.`
`She had finally arrived at this land after a long journey, just as Hanyuu's people had.`
`"......So that's the case...... After your long journey, you finally......"`
`"I, was frozen in that pitch black ocean, and I finally reached, this land...... ......Yet........."`
`Rika finally realized it.`
` ......She was terrified.`
`She had finally arrived here,`
` and now she was anxious as to whether she could live safely or not.`
`It wasn't unreasonable.`
` From her perspective as an inhuman being, it was far too dangerous in Okinomiya with the current uproar.`
`The people turned ferocious by η173 were killing each other in a sight out of hell.`
`It was far too sad for her to receive such a welcome`
` ......after finally reaching this land after her long, frozen journey through space.`
`Hanyuu then followed up by sending Une images of what she knew.`
`For a while, Rika's head was flooded with both of their passing images,`
` her mind like a television screen flickering between channels......`
`Then they finally understood each other's upbringing, circumstances, and present situation.`
`Rika was also able to convert those concepts into human words`
` and understand it vaguely.`
`First off, she understood that Une was the same as Hanyuu and Tamura`
` - an inhuman being.`
`She was one of the inhuman people from space who lived within humans just as humans lived on Earth.`
`She reached this planet just the other day.`
` ......However, that was according to said inhuman being's perception of time, so it might have been several years.`
`Her body had finally acclimated to Earth, and she had just regained self-awareness.`
`......She was more of a seed as she drifted through space,`
` and only regained her self-awareness after taking root here on Earth and finally budding.`
`Rika also understood the special nature of Une's people.`
`The special nature of Hanyuu's horned people...`
` drove people to paranoia when they grew unstable, and caused their hearts to become possessed by those demons.`
`......That was a disadvantage for them, when trying to coexist with humanity,`
` and it was a problem both Hanyuu, Tamura, and the horned people recognized. `
`That problem is also the aspect that Takano showed interest in.`
`In Une's case, her people carried no such disadvantage.`
`They were much better adapted to coexisting with humanity than Hanyuu's people were.`
`"So unlike you, they're the type that Tamura would have welcomed."`
`"......There's no way Tamurahime-no-Mikoto would welcome any new arrivals. ......To her, both Une and I are equally terrifying invaders......"`
`Une's people possessed "strength" nearly equal to Hanyuu's.`
`"Strength? ......The image that's pouring into my head is the strength of a plant's roots."`
`"Fragile flowers that bloom beautifully in a flower garden will sometimes be overtaken by wildflowers with powerful roots. ......It's that same strength."`
`In Hanyuu's world,`
` their peoples were better described with the concept of plants than animals.`
`......Yes.`
` Even in the world of plants, there was survival of the fittest.`
`Hanyuu and Une had very strong power to survive.`
` Their peoples were hardy species with strong roots.`
`"So what about Tamura's people? ......The ones that view you as an enemy?"`
`"Her people are much weaker than mine. ......However, that's no one's fault, nor is it fate. It's just ......the special nature we were born with."`
`To these inhuman beings, the Earth was a big flower bed.`
`They were all trying to sow their seeds,`
` and allow their species to flourish.`
`In the past, Tamura's people were the only flowers blooming`
` in the flower bed of Earth.`
`Then Hanyuu's species showed up,`
` and with their strong reproductive ability, they quickly dried up Tamura's people and increased their population.`
`......So of course,`
` from Tamurahime-no-Mikoto's perspective, they were invaders.`
`On top of that, Hanyuu's species posed the risk of destroying the flower bed if they grew unstable.`
`Nothing could survive if the flower bed was destroyed.`
`So that's why Hanyuu's people agreed to confine themselves to Hinamizawa, the flower bed best suited for them,`
` until they were able to gain the power to coexist with their flower bed.`
`Yet now,`
` this Une, a species with the same amount of strength, has once again entered the flower bed.`
`Fortunately, Une's people will not harm the flower bed.`
`However,`
` they possess the strength to easily wipe out Tamura's people......`
`"......We, Have no such intentions...... We just want, a little bit of land for ourselves........."`
`"I understand how you feel. ......I support you in this as well. As one who has also crossed the ocean of stars."`
`"......In that case, she's just arrived at the worst possible time. It's hard to imagine Tamura welcoming another species with Hanyuu's people running rampant like they are now."`
`".........I am, scared...... ......We, simply want to, bloom quietly, in peace........."`
`"Is there no land beyond Tamura's reach?"`
`"Nearly all the land of Japan belongs to Tamura's people. ......Even if she were to leave Japan, there are other peoples living in those lands too."`
`"So the Earth is like a full apartment complex with no vacancies......"`
`"......But I believe Tamurahime-no-Mikoto's people are claiming too much. We must respect those who lived here before us, but they should share the land. Tamura's a bully for monopolizing it, au."`
`"Why don't you just go all Sengoku Era and compete for the land? Survival of the fittest is the law of nature, right?"`
`"Because that would lead to something terrible. Our flower bed and this very planet would meet their end, auau!"`
`"......Now that you mention it, you and Une are about equally strong, right? What would happen if you fought?"`
`"I-I, don't want to fight......"`
`"I don't want to fight either, and there's no point in fighting her anyway. Because our strength is equal."`
`"Meaning what?"`
`"In our case, the flower bed would go to the fastest one, au."`
`"I, don't want to fight......"`
`"So you're saying that the people of Hinamizawa can't be infected by Une, right?"`
`"That's right."`
`"And likewise, the humans with Une's parasite can't come down with Hinamizawa Syndrome."`
`"That would be, correct."`
`I think I might have figured out how to identify aliens.`
`Anyway, something's nagging at me......`
` This means......`
`"Hanyuu. ......What were we doing, again?"`
`"Au? Did you hit your head on tofu or something?"`
`"We can't allow Takano to run wild, right? She's trying to spread η173 throughout the world. So our goal is to stop that, right?"`
`"Yes, it is...... But what about it?"`
`"You're an idiot! A huge idiot! I can't believe it! It's two birds with one stone!"`
`"......I don't really understand you......"`
`"We just need to forget about Tamura and help this girl live freely on our planet! I mean, the humans possessed by Tamura's people can be taken over by Une, right? And the people Une's taken over can't be taken over by your people!"`
`The pair of stupid aliens both tilted their heads in confusion.`
`It makes sense! Now all the pieces are in place!`
`I know the identity of Takano's "Devil"!`
` This is all we have to do!`
`"So we just need to get Une into the people of Japan faster than Takano! Once we do that, no one will become infected, even if Takano spreads η173 everywhere!"`
`Well, I would feel kind of bad about clearing Tamura's people out,`
` so why don't we stick to just the prefecture so we can block Takano in?`
`There's 47 different prefectures, so Tamurahime-no-Mikoto can spare at least one.`
`Once we've surrounded Takano with Une, she won't be able to spread the infection any further.`
`We'll seal off the spread of η173 and be able to prevent further damage!`
`Now I get it! That development would prove fatal from Takano's perspective.`
` Une has to be the true identity of the "Devil" she spoke to Tomitake about.`
`That's the only thing that makes sense.`
`Une and η173 are evenly matched.`
` They can't beat each other.`
`If we infect people with Une before they get η173, then we'll ruin all of Takano's plans!`
`"So there you have it!"`
`"Oh... Ohh! That's an incredible idea, Rika!!"`
`"......I-I, kind of, understand, maybe......?"`
`"This is an incredibly good idea! Une will get to live on our planet, and we'll be able to prevent any more tragedy! Plus we'll drive Tamura out of this prefecture, so it's two birds with one stone!!"`
`If Une occupies the entire prefecture, then Tamura's people will be driven out of here.`
`That would mean we'd never see Tamurahime-no-Mikoto again unless we left the prefecture, and we wouldn't have to listen to her complaints.`
`For the first time in a thousand years, we could strike a blow against the "god" who claimed all of Japan for herself and nagged us any time we set even a foot upon her land!`
`Hanyuu was dancing with joy.`
` She must be thoroughly at odds with Tamura.`
`......Well, with such an arrogant attitude and condescending posturing, even Rika wanted strike her after only meeting her once.`
`"......What .....should I do......?"`
`"There's nothing we can do about Okinomiya. After all, this city's already infected with η173. So you can't infect the people here, right?"`
`"......That's, right."`
`"In that case, what should we do......?"`
`"......Well ......hmm......"`
`According to Tomitake, all means of transit out of the city had been cut off to prevent the spread of infection.`
`In other words, we couldn't get Une out of η173's infected region.`
`We would have to escape this city before Takano does,`
` and spread Une's people.`
`We should probably talk to Tomitake and gain his support.`
`Since Tomitake knows about the parasitic neurovirus, he should understand our situation too.`
`Even if he does reject the idea of spreading Une,`
` the information could lead to the discovery of a new treatment or even a vaccine.`
`Rika called Tomitake over and explained the situation.`
`Of course, gaining his understanding`
` took until dawn.`
`Yet even so, he ultimately understood.`
`"Interesting. All right. ......We'll have to leave the decision up to Tokyo, but her existence is... it's a huge deal. If Une-chan's willing to cooperate, then we can prepare comfortable accommodations for her as well."`
`"I-I wouldn't be opposed, to being comfortable......"`
`"Tomitake's an understanding man. I'm sure he'll treat you well, Une."`
`"......I'm, happy......"`
`"The end of this tragedy is finally in our sights......"`
`"Well, we can't claim that until we get Une outside of the city, ......but it's at least one problem solved, I suppose?"`
`The Sonozaki Group office was the safest and most tightly guarded place in Okinomiya.`
`It had food, resources, weapons, everything.`
` They had Tomitake's understanding and cooperation.`
` They had Une's cooperation as well.`
`In terms of chess, they were now a few moves away from checkmate.`
` It was the perfect time for their opponent to give up.`
`......Unless the Joker, Takano, caused some kind of uproar.`
`"Plus...... there's that obnoxious Tamurahime-no-Whatever."`
`"......She's...... not likely to welcome what we're trying to do now."`
`That was when they heard the ringing of a tuning fork,`
` and bright, white light enveloped both Rika and Hanyuu.`
`......She's here.`
` Tamurahime-no-Mikoto.`
`"Speak of the devil."`
`".........How dare you, leader of the horned people! Truly, you have been plotting to taint our land with your filthy shoes!"`
`"We will welcome our new friend, Une. Yet that does not mean we will steal all of your land."`
`"Be quiet, tainted one! Know that we shall not permit your conspiracy to corrupt our land!"`
`"Listen, there's this villain, Takano, and she's plotting to spread what you call the horned people to all of Japan, no, the entire world! If she does, then your people will be exterminated."`
`"Getting angry at us isn't going to prevent that from happening. If you're willing to cede a bit of land to Une, then Une's people can live on this planet, and you won't lose any more land. Hanyuu won't have to see your face ever again either, and this can all be settled quietly between you three."`
`"Be quiet, child of man. Know that you are not permitted to use your tainted words."`
`"Owwww...... Stop using that headache power......"`
`"She has always been stubborn and refuses to listen. Nothing you say will ever get through to her."`
`"You are the one who never listens! You tainted people, you horned people! My anger has not abated, even after a thousand years!!"`
`"I could say the same to you! I haven't lost any of my anger either, for all of your harrassment!"`
`I didn't know what kind of history those two shared,`
` but if they held onto their grudges for a millenium...... then the cause of their antagonism ran deep.`
`Apparently their history really isn't something humans, who only live for around a century, could moderate.`
`Well, that's just how gods are.`
` Humans worship them all on their own, and yet the gods themselves are more human than humans. `
`There are plenty of myths in every country about gods arguing and fighting with each other.`
`"I don't care about the fight between you two. Tamura-no-Whatever, if you don't want to listen, that's fine. But this is the only way to stop the tragedy happening in the human world!"`
`"You wouldn't understand anything I said anyway, foolish priestess of the horned people. Know that I have no intentions of exchanging words with a tainted priestess either."`
`"You're a god, okay, but you really tick me off. Maybe we shouldn't stop at one prefecture and just take Toyama and Gifu while we're at it too?"`
`"I will not allow it! Know that I shall not allow you to corrupt the land of my people once more!!"`
`There was the sound of glass shattering`
` followed by an angry, bellowing roar.`
`What happened?!`
` Considering the timing, it was obvious Tamura had done something.`
`Yet Tamurahime-no-Mikoto was an inhuman being like Hanyuu.`
`She shouldn't be able to interfere with the world of man directly......`
`"T-Takano-san?!"`
`"Hello, Jirou-san. I had faith you and I would meet again. Heehee."`
`Takano had broken through the window and flew into the office.`
`The whole spectacle was as flashy as a scene from a movie,`
` and the men were all taken aback......`
`Of course even Tomitake couldn't avoid being dumbstruck.`
`She was always unpredictable, but that was only in personality.`
` She never had the physical ability to accomplish something like that......`
`The men of the Sonozaki group understood she was hostile from the aggressive smile on her face.`
`Yet unlike with the rioters, they were unsure of how to respond.`
`Meanwhile, Takano was different.`
` She understood exactly what she needed to be doing.`
`Tomitake soon understood too.`
` ......Her target was Une.`
`If we spread Une's infection throughout Japan first, then η173 will become useless.`
` There won't be anything Takano can do then.`
`But since she knew that from the start, she's targeting Une.`
`Trying to uncover where she was hiding out in Okinomiya was inefficient.`
` But once the Sonozaki group started sheltering people, Takano realized something.`
`She just had to wait here, and Une would come to her!`
`"I only have business with that girl Une. ......Could you bring her out for me, by chance?"`
`"I don't know what you're talking about."`
`"You don't need to play dumb. I've been watching you this whole time, after all. Heeheehee......"`
`".........I won't let you. We're going to contact Tokyo."`
`"Pardon me for interrupting! Welcome to the Sonozaki group's office, Miyo-san!"`
`"My, my, quite the procession."`
`Shion appeared with an array of tough men in tow.`
`It went without explanation that Takano was an uninvited guest.`
`"You're a tough woman, but I think you've gone too far now."`
`"I think you're about to understand just how strong I am."`
`"Gh?!"`
`"Gah!"`
`Takano grabbed one head each in both her right and left hands, slamming them against opposite walls.`
`Where did such monstrous strength come from in that slender frame?!`
` No,`
` even someone huge couldn't have produced such strength.`
`The physics of it were all wrong.`
` Even if her slender frame did house monstrous strength, she couldn't have picked those big men up and thrown them so easily from that particular stance.`
`Shion, Kasai, and the other men watched in shock,`
` and all they could do was stare at Takano's otherworldly power.`
`"Shion-chan, if you don't pay attention... then your head will get splattered everywhere."`
`"Hii?!"`
`Shion's dumbstruck eyes met Takano's,`
` and for once she cringed with fear.`
`I couldn't blame her.`
` When a human witnesses something beyond their understanding, they're completely unable to act until they can explain it.`
`Takano's arms looked like huge bear paws to her`
` ......and before she could blink, those arms were swinging ferociously toward Shion......`
`"Look out!!!"`
`As Kasai shoved Shion out of the way he grabbed Takano's swinging arm`
` and used her own force to capture her arm behind her and shove her body onto the floor.`
`"My, my......"`
`"What a frightening person...... Where on earth did you obtain such strength......?"`
`"Kasai! Way to go!"`
`He got a good lock on her joints and pressed her into the ground.`
` No matter how much strength she had, she shouldn't be able to struggle any longer.`
`Takano wriggled in an effort to escape,`
` but she just looked like a pathetic bug pinned on its back.`
`"You should cease your futile resistance. Kasai's a scary man, so if you struggle too much, he might break your arm?"`
`"I won't do it unless it's necessary...`
` but I'm no gentleman, so forgive me if it comes to that."`
`"My, oh no. I really can't move. Heehee......"`
`With her joints locked so securely,`
` it should hurt enough for her face to twist in pain.`
`Yet Takano remained collected, and seemed amused at her inability to move.`
`"Is this the full extent?`
` Of the power you're granting me......?`
` ......It's not, is it?`
` Hee......`
` Heeheeheehee......!"`
`"Nnngh!`
` ......Nngoh...!"`
`Takano used her other arm`
` ......and with just that single arm, lifted both herself and her grappler, Kasai.`
`It was like we were watching some kind of circus performance.`
`No.`
` Takano's irregular, monstrous strength allowed her, with just one arm,`
` to lift both herself and Kasai into the air.`
`Even Kasai couldn't avoid being shocked.`
`In the next moment, he lost his hold on her,`
` and she spun Kasai like a blender, throwing him against the wall.`
`"You're having too much fun!!"`
`Shion got behind Takano, and pale blue sparks could be seen.`
` She had driven her trump card - her stun gun - into Takano's body.`
`No matter how strong you are, no body can withstand electric jolts.`
`Yet Takano just calmly turned around......`
`"My, my. ......What is that?"`
`"T-That's impossible......!!"`
`"To think a mere child would do such a thing to the priestess of a god...... What a bad girl......"`
`Takano's hand seized hold of Shion's face.`
`Shion groaned and fought back, and we heard her skull grating,`
` her resistance like a baby's against Takano's vice-like strength.`
`"Heehee. This is your punishment, okay?"`
`The next moment`
` Shion's body was splayed out against the wall.`
`For Shion, it was no different than her body being slammed into the ground.`
` It felt just like she had been thrown out of the second story and slammed onto the hard, concrete ground.`
`Then her body slid down and crumpled onto the floor with a groan.`
`Yet Takano was about to walk toward Shion again`
` looking for something else from her......`
`"Stop this now, Takano-san! I don't want to shoot you!"`
`"Oh my, Jirou-san. ......Heehee, that's a very interesting idea. I'm very curious to find out if a human weapon can injure me now. Heeheehee......"`
`Takano gazed at Tomitake's submachine gun with amusement.`
`It didn't seem to be the uniquely Japanese scorn of assuming it was just a model gun either.`
`She was truly smiling,`
` keenly curious as to what it would happen if she were shot by it.`
`Tomitake failed to understand that too.`
` ......Right now, Takano had to be gifted with some form of supernatural power.`
`"You made Takano your priestess, Tamurahime-no-Mikoto...!! How could you be such a fool?!"`
`"Be quiet! Know that I shall not listen to you!`
` I shall punish all peoples who dare to taint our sacred land!`
` Know that your hindrance is useless!!`
` Prepare yourself,`
` Une!!"`
`"......I h-haven't done anything......"`
`"Insolence! Know that all your corruption lies bare before my eyes!"`
`"......It, was never...... my intention to......"`
`"She said the same thing when I arrived here, and tormented me badly. She's just a bully!"`
`"Tamura-no-Whatever.`
` I hold no grudge against you, but I personally dislike your priestess.`
` So sorry, but if you're choosing right,`
` then we're choosing left!"`
`"Priestess of mine! ......The devil Une stands here! Now is the moment to slay her!!"`
`"......So that's where you are, Une-chan."`
`Takano looked at the wall.`
` She could see Une's figure through it.`
`Une also noticed she was being stared at and shuddered.`
`"R-Run...!! We can't stop her!!"`
`Once Takano checked her right fist,`
` she slowly pressed it into the wall.`
`Then...... cracks began to spread through the wall, radiating slowly out from her fist......`
`"W-What's happening...?!!"`
`"Tomitake-san said run! So run!!"`
`"Une-chan, hurry, this way!!"`
`"......R...... Run......`
` Hiii........."`
`The cracks in the wall spread even deeper before their eyes,`
` and they could hear the ground quaking.`
`There was no room left for doubts.`
` Takano was planning to smash right through the wall...!`
`"Why does Tamura's priestess have such incredible power, when your priestess gets nothing?!"`
`"Rika, don't say that! If you say that, it's over! Auauau!!"`
`"Rika-chan, what are you doing?!!`
` Run!!`
` Uwaah!!"`
`Such a simple wall couldn't stop Takano -`
` no, the priestess of Tamurahime-no-Mikoto.`
`She smashed through the wall as easily as crushing a sand castle.`
`"I found you, Une-chaaan! Heeheeheehee!!"`
`"Hii...... Hiiii!`
` ......Hiii......!`
` Ah!"`
`"Une-chan!!!"`
`Une slipped and fell, failing to escape.`
`Takano wasn't foolish enough to let that chance slip by.`
` She strode right in and seized Une by her collar.`
`"Now I've got you......!!"`
`"Sorry!`
` It was the pretty, misfortunate girl,`
` Satoko-chan!`
` Did you think it was Une-san?"`
`"Too bad for you!`
` Ohhohohoho!!"`
`While she had kept her composure with a gun pointed at her, Takano's mind went blank for a moment after that.`
`After Rika shared Une's secret with them, they prepared the ultimate trap to protect her.`
`They had Satoko, who was close to her height, change into her clothes and take her place.`
` Of course, the slip and fall was all a calculated move to draw Takano's eyes toward her.`
`The shock of seeing her otherworldly power smash through the wall`
` wasn't enough to overcome the thrill of trying to catch her in a trap.`
`"S-Satokoooooooooo!!"`
`"Ohhohohohohoho! And here's a present for our fool!"`
`Satoko took advantage of Takano's stupor to place something onto her head.`
`It was a...... pair of white, fluffy`
` bunny ears?!`
`"Now, Hanyuu...!!"`
`"Here I go!`
` Flash!!"`
`"Huh? What's this......?! B-Bunny ears...?!"`
`"Huh?!"`
`Hanyuu had used her inhuman powers to interfere with Tamura's own power for a moment,`
` creating a break in the protection Takano received as her priestess.`
`Of course, since Tamura was very powerful due to ruling over vast regions of land, Hanyuu could only break her power for a moment.`
`However......`
` That moment was plenty......!`
`Rena's heavy blow was concentrated on Takano's face, and Keiichi swept her feet in the opposite direction.`
`Takano's body spun in the air and then slammed face-down onto the mountain of rubble she'd created herself.`
`If she had Tamurahime-no-Mikoto's protection, then Rena's attack would've been little more than the toying of a housecat.`
`But in that one moment, she had reverted to the ordinary Takano.`
` ......Which meant that it was a finishing blow.`
`Takano suffered a concussion and passed out.`
`"W-What's going on......? Is Rena-san...... really human?"`
`"......I...... I'm surprised...... Hahahahaha."`
`After witnessing Takano's supernatural power just a moment ago,`
` Shion and the others could replace their shock with strained smiles.`
`Of course.`
` Because they just witnessed a club member instantly beat her and her superhuman strength......`
`"Uhh, don't go saying I did nothing, okay? This was my strategy, and I devised it after considering our situation and all our members' abilities."`
`"......Oh, Sis. You're here? I didn't notice."`
`"I can't believe she took down that monstrous version of Takano-san...... so effortlessly......"`
`"Une-san, there's nothing to fear anymore. You can come out now!"`
`"......It's not scary, anymore......?"`
`Une timidly emerged from the shadows where she hid wearing Satoko's clothes.`
`......Normally we wouldn't have been able to fool Tamurahime-no-Mikoto's eyes with just a change of clothes.`
`Takano was certainly able to see Une, even through a wall, with her divine power.`
`Yet when Takano broke through the wall and saw her with her own eyes, her human perception took priority, and she mistook Une for Satoko because of her clothes.`
` That's why she fell for the club members' trap.`
`"My priestess...... How could you!"`
`"Takano's passed out! You can't lend her your power anymore!"`
`It's amusing that the Japanese word for "passing out" is written as "losing god".`
`Tamura may have been granting Takano powerful strength as her priestess, but she couldn't give her anything while she was unconscious.`
`"It's unfortunate for you. This wasn't our first or second time dealing with Takano."`
`"This happened because you underestimated the power of my priestess!`
` Now, Tamurahime-no-Mikoto!`
` You shall be silent for a while!`
`Hanyuu Flash!!"`
`"Nmwaaaaaaaaahh......!!!"`
`Hanyuu made scissor symbols with both her hands and placed them near her horns, causing a bright light to rush forth and banish the sight of Tamurahime-no-Mikoto.`
`Apparently erasing the image of Tamura didn't mean defeating her, though.`
` But I'm still grateful we won't have to see that annoying face for a while.`
`Tamura let out a scream and a pose like a defeated Sentai villain before disappearing.`
`"Now, let's get Takano-san all tied up while we can."`
`"She was incredibly strong too! We'll need to bind her with chains."`
`I felt sorry for her.`
` Takano was just a frail woman without Tamura's power, but her bonds were ridiculously secure.`
`Well, that settles that.`
`"......Is, everything settled, for us......?"`
`"It is! That mean old nuisance Tamura is gone now!"`
`"Tomitake will take care of the rest. Isn't that right?"`
`"Is that true, Mion-chan?! Amazing! You have everything here!"`
`"Well, there's nothing we Sonozakis can't get ahold of."`
`"What's going on?"`
`"Apparently there's a powerful radio here! Sounds like Tomitake-san can use it to make contact with the outside!"`
`It was the Sonozakis' illegally modified radio.`
`According to Tomitake, it could send signals out without being affected by the radio interference.`
`"I'll test it to see if I can contact Tokyo. Une-chan might be the savior we need, after all!"`
`In order to use the neuroparasite as a weapon, it was essential to have a vaccine for it.`
`So the strength of Une's roots would prove a powerful vaccine against the infection of η173 and most other viruses like it.`
`Tokyo would definitely be interested in that.`
`"You're incredible, Tomitake-san. You can do anything."`
`"Well, hahaha...`
` I-I just studied it a bit as a hobby......!"`
`"That's the end of our grand adventure... ...I suppose?"`
`"I hope so. I'm already exhausted."`
`"......I can, leave......? This town now......?"`
`"Yes, you can get out. Well, you'll probably be held prisoner for a while, though. But they can't do anything without your cooperation, so you'll be treated well, I think."`
`"Une. Welcome to Earth. Let's both bloom together here on this planet. ......With Tamurahime-no-Mikoto as well, of course."`
`"......I'm, so happy...... Thank you, Hanyuu......"`
`Early the next morning.`
` Une and the others were in the school courtyard designated over the radio.`
`Roughly 30 of the Sonozaki Group's toughest men were surrounding them and glaring in all directions.`
`A helicopter was approaching.`
` Une was the only one being extracted.`
`"Take care! We've paid you back for saving us now!"`
`"I hope you manage to save everyone with your body's secret."`
`"......Thank you, for taking care of me......"`
`Une was forced to wear airtight clothes.`
` All the JSDF men riding in the helicopter were in them too.`
`"It's a slight shame how we're being left behind, though."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` η17......`
` No,`
` until we understand the cause of this illness, we can't be allowed to leave."`
`"So even though everything's settled with Une-chan, we're still stuck in survival mode for now."`
`"Well, you'll be safe as long you stay here. I think this strange illness will settle down over time."`
`"There's fewer of those crazy people already. Peace will soon return to this city."`
`The rioters who handed their hearts over to demons continued to kill each other without getting tired of it.`
`But like Kasai said, eventually they'd kill themselves off and things would quiet down.`
`From what Tomitake heard over the radio, they were already preparing to send aid to Shishibone City, and food, water, and other necessities would be transported by air.`
`......Such an incredibly large uproar couldn't be wrapped up that easily.`
`But we had our light of hope.`
` Une was the key.`
`"......Thank, you......"`
`"Do your best out there. I'm happy to welcome you to this planet."`
`"......I'm, happy too.`
` ......I'm super happy.`
` Kfufufufufufufufufu......"`
`Une waved her hand from the helicopter flying away.`
`The club members all waved innocently back at her.`
`Only Rika absent-mindedly watched her go.`
`She was pondering something she couldn't explain in Une's smile as she left......`
`Afterward, she was transferred to Tokyo's facility, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.`
`With the disaster already reaching several hundred thousand people, it was no longer possible to cover up the existence of Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`The world was in an uproar over this mysterious virus, capable of making humans randomly go violent.`
`Of course, the secret research institutions of the major nations that knew about neuroparasites were paying attention to the progress of the current neuroparasite biohazard. `
`They dispatched many researchers to "help".`
` Because there was no guarantee it would remain solely Japan's problem once it reached that point.`
`Samples of Une's cerebrospinal fluid were taken and transported to the most classified research labs of each nation......`
`"......My seeds,`
` have reached every corner of this blue flower bed.`
` ......Kfufufufu, I'm happy.`
` ......I'm super happy.`
` Kfufufufufufufufufufufufu......"`
`"Foolish leader of the horned people...... Tremble in fear at your sin of unleashing that terrifyingly corrupt people upon our world."`
`"It's already too late. Your and Takano's evil plot is finished now. Auauau!"`
`"..................... ......Tamurahime-no-Mikoto. If you have something you want to say, why not say it? What was it you were trying to achieve? Takano was your priestess. So Takano was following your orders and trying to accomplish some specific task. What was it?"`
`"That's not even worth asking. She was bullying Une and trying to spread Hinamizawa Syndrome everywhere to sow chaos! Au!"`
`"That doesn't make sense, though. ......Hanyuu, the Syndrome is a tainted people to her, right? So why would Tamura have Takano spread them elsewhere?"`
`"......Au?"`
`"Tomitake said that Takano was going to defeat a 'devil' and in doing so, save humanity. Then she started spreading η173."`
`"......She's both trying to save humanity, and trying to destroy it. These goals contradict each other, but I didn't pay it any mind because I was sure it was just one of Takano's crazy delusions...... but if it was all as Tamura ordered, then none of it was meaningless."`
`"A mere child of man, let alone the priestess of the foolish horned people wouldn't understand, even if I were to tell you. ......Ahh, how foolish you are."`
`"Please don't look down on me. Unlike her, my head isn't filled with cream puffs."`
`"Rika, I don't understand what you're getting at at all."`
`"Tamura loathes the horned people,`
` so why would she try to spread them outside of Hinamizawa?`
` .........It can't be......"`
`The horned people and Une's people had equally strong roots.`
`On top of that, Tamura called Une a devil.`
`And she told Takano that she would save humanity......`
`"......You had Takano spread η173 ......so Une couldn't spread herself......?"`
`"Yes, after all, just as those infected by Une couldn't be infected by η173, the reverse was also true. If you infected them with η173, they couldn't be infected by Une!"`
`"But if she infects them with us, then those with weak minds will be in big trouble. There's no worry about that with Une, though."`
`"How do you know that? You've just convinced yourself that's the case after communicating with Une, right? In other words, you've just accepted Une's claims without question, haven't you?"`
`"......Au?"`
`"I see. ......It appears the leader's foolishness has not infected her priestess."`
`"That means that you made a hard choice. ......You decided that handing over a portion of your land - the entirety of Shishibone City - to the tainted people was at least preferable to that."`
`"Isn't that right...?! ......Which means..... that you knew... about Une, didn't you......?"`
`"......Hers is an accursed race which brought forth great catastrophe upon her mother land......"`
`"Kfufufufufufufufufu...!! This is, super fun! Kfufufufufufufufu!"`
`"Une...! It's been a while."`
`"Foolish Hanyuu. Know her true nature, and tremble with terror at your sin!"`
`"Tamurahime-no-Mikoto...... You totally pulled a fast one on me. The moment I awoke and tried to bloom...... the flower bed around me was already filled with that fool's flowers."`
`"I'm sure she did get you good. This cream puff for brains is a useless weed, but her roots are strong enough that you couldn't beat them."`
`"......You tried to make your infection explode through the population, but since Takano had already spread η173, you couldn't do that."`
`"I was at a total loss.`
` But then a dumbass who believed my story just happened to show up.`
` ......Kfufufufufufufufu......!!"`
`......Even though her brain was an empty cream puff, lacking even in cream,`
` she finally realized that she'd been tricked.`
`Hanyuu had believed that they understood everything about each other after her communication with Une.`
`Hanyuu had openly shared everything about herself because she was so simple,`
` but that wasn't the case for Une.`
`......She cleverly hid her true nature and her terrifying plot to deceive Hanyuu.`
`"Which means...... Tamurahime-no-Mikoto. You saw through her, didn't you?"`
`"Know that the plot from the leader of such accursed people could never deceive my insight."`
`Tamura had known what Une was after.`
`Une's goal...`
` was to propagate herself throughout every corner of this blue planet's huge flower bed.`
`"If she did that, then you all would perish, huh? So you had to fight. ......Just like you once fought Hanyuu's people."`
`Hanyuu said Tamura was once mean to her, but that probably wasn't her just being mean.`
` From Tamura's perspective, she was likely fighting to protect herself.`
`Fortunately, they learned Hanyuu's people couldn't live outside of Hinamizawa,`
` so they managed to maintain a thousand years of peace by avoiding each other.`
`However,`
` if a new people that weren't bound to such a small area came here......`
`"I see. To you, she certainly would be a devil. ......And so you used Takano to stop her."`
`"......But calling her a devil that'll destroy humanity is going too far. She might be a devil that would destroy you, but the humans don't know or care which parasite is living in their heads."`
`"......I suppose that's the limit of the understanding of the horned people's priestess. Foolish."`
`"Kfufufufufufufufu...... It's super too late now, you idiots! We're totally consuming this whole planet!"`
`"Now, awaken, my children! My seeds...!! Sink your roots into this world and bloom, bloom and spread yourselves wide......!!"`
`Une spread her arms like she was spreading a pair of wings...... and issued her orders to all of her children scattered throughout the whole world.`
`The children of man couldn't quarantine Une's seeds with their mere concept of disease prevention.`
`The humans researching her across the world were already infected......`
`America, Georgia State, Atlanta.`
`America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was the fortress on the frontlines protecting humanity from viral infections, and also the highest world authority on the subject.`
`Yet in a secret ward, the neuroparasite research division, they were researching her children.`
`They were researching it with the greatest precautions and most modern equipment...`
` but the techniques of mere mortals were unable to stop the spread of the children of a god......`
`The head researcher first collapsed on a bus on his day off.`
`People rushed to his aid one after another and collapsed as well until the driver also lost consciousness.`
`Fortunately the bus was already stopped.`
` ......Yet that wasn't a silver lining.`
`Because neither humanity or even inhuman beings possessed the means to stop the spread of Une's children.`
`The same thing happened in Sverdlovsk Oblast, within the Russian Federation,`
` right in Yekaterinburg's secret biological weapon research center.`
`Of course it also happened in Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases within Shinjuku, Tokyo,`
` as well as in other research centers in England, France, China, Korea, and other nations too.`
`And then they traveled through the transportation technology that humanity had foolishly over-developed......`
` spreading to all lands throughout the world......`
`However, humanity lacked the means to notice it at all.`
`Roughly two weeks after the initial spread of infection,`
` when Une's children had spread throughout every corner of the globe, the first symptoms developed.`
`The infected`
` (Though, at this point "the infected" and "all humanity" were synonymous......)`
` then learned for the very first time that they were all infected with something unknown to them.`
`People were afflicted with intense drowsiness...`
` and one after another they crumpled and fell asleep on the spot.`
`They had become a seed bed.`
`Once they finished consuming all of the nutrients of their host, they broke out through the host's body, spread more seeds, and consumed all of humanity.`
`Because Une's people had no intention of coexisting with humanity at all.`
`Once they had consumed their flower bed, they would travel through space once more in search of the next.`
` An accursed people indeed......`
`Seven weeks after the initial infection, humanity's population was reduced to 20% of its former size.`
`Of course, even that 20% was being culled as well.`
`Then they would once more return to space in search of an organism with a brain to host them.`
`Afterward, only the hosts of the horned people who couldn't be infected by that accursed people would remain on Earth.`
`Which meant that only those people in this region, who Takano had infected with η173`
` and had not turned their hearts over to a demon managed to survive......`
`There were far too few humans remaining to maintain civilized society.`
`So eventually they too would perish completely......`
`"Kfufufufufufufu! Khahahahahahahaha......!!"`
`"Super fun!`
` Super happy!`
` Super awesome!`
` Super super duper!`
` Super kfufuhahahahahaha!!"`
`"U-Une........."`
`"Consuming everything is my people's only entertainment. And I mean, consuming an entire planet is super fun!"`
`"Once my people have consumed them all, no one will be able to get in our way. When faced with me, the weak flowers of this planet are like sugar lumps before hot coffee!!"`
`"......You've sure done it now. You pretended to be weak so you could use us to advance your plans. Well done."`
`"I couldn't fool Tamurahime-no-Mikoto. ......She was clever."`
`"Do not underestimate me. Know that I am the leader of the people ruling over this nation of Yamato!"`
`"Yet that horn head and her priestess! You two were super easy to fool! Kfufufufufufu! When the god's a fool, so is the priestess! You two were both super dumb. Kfufufufufufufu!!"`
`"When the god's incompetent, so is the priestess!`
` You're a useless god with nothing useful to your name! No power, and no supernatural power either!`
` You're a super dumbo!! Khahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"......What is this? She's ticking me off five times as much as Tamura."`
`"I really agree...... It's really annoying to hear us called incompetent....."`
`"Know that you are indeed incompetent! You are tainted people, and now foolish people! You should hit your head on a steamed bun and die!"`
`"Well I never knew that Une was going to destroy the world! It's not my fault!"`
`"You know that all other races are enemies!! Yet you just handed it over to her! There is a limit to how stupid one can be!!"`
`"Auauau!! You could've just told us that, Tamura! So it's your fault, Tamura!"`
`"Be quiet! I will not listen to you tainted people!!"`
`"Kfufufufuhahahahahahahaha!`
` This is super fun!`
` Khahahahahaha!!`
`Perish, you stupid gods of this blue flower bed! Your stupid humans, your incompetent priestesses too!"`
`Une laughed loudly`
` while Hanyuu and Tamura insulted each other like children.`
`......It seemed quite pathetic that this was a fight between gods who had brought about the extinction of humanity.`
`Rika placed a hand on her forehead like she was enduring a headache, but her frustration was winning at that particular moment.`
`"Listen, I don't consider myself a human, and I don't care if our world is destroyed. But there's one thing I just can't forgive."`
`"......The fact you looked at me, Rika Furude, who has overcome the mountain that is hundreds of deaths, and called me incompetent."`
`"......The term incompetent`
` is what you use for a man who goes off to the hot spring at a critical moment...!"`
`"You intend to oppose me? You, a mere child of man?`
` That's super funny.`
` Kfufufufufufu!"`
`Rika pulled something out of nowhere that glinted with a silver light.`
`"What is that......?"`
`"......Don't you know? It's a kitchen knife. A cooking tool. The perfect instrument for chopping up food... and detestable people."`
`"Kfufufufufu! I'm super laughing right now! How do you plan on fighting me with a tool of mankind? That's super funny. Super kfufufufufu...!!"`
`From the perspective of humans, those inhuman beings were like a moon on the water's surface.`
`She could swing a weapon all she wanted in the world of man, but it wouldn't even disturb the water's surface,`
` let alone harm the moon floating in the sky.`
`However,`
` for them to manifest in the world of man, they required a priestess.`
` To put it in human terms, they required a queen carrier as a host.`
`If she defeated Une's queen carrier (was that correct to say? Or was it better to say 'Une herself'?)`
` then she could at least deal a decisive blow to her.`
`"However, my body is super beyond your reach. You can't even leave Shishibone City, so you can't lay a finger on her."`
`"Nearly all of my people have been taken captive..... I have no idea where she is at present...... If only I could've taken her down while she was trapped in Shishibone...... But thanks to this tainted cream puff!"`
`"That's enough!`
` Honestly, it's your fault for being so petty, Tamura,`
` and holding a thousand year grudge over a single meal!"`
`"I'll never give you a single grain of rice that has been dedicated to me!!"`
`"I was starving!!`
` You could've spared a little!!"`
`"......Stop it, you two.`
` Besides,`
` this battle isn't over yet."`
`"Oh? And how are you going to face me by yourself when I've super enveloped your entire world? That's super funny! The battle isn't over? This battle is totally super over already!"`
`"You're right. This battle is over already. As far as you two can conceive. But from my perspective, it isn't over yet."`
`"......No, perhaps it's more accurate to say this battle was over the moment you revealed your true nature? It's over... and it's my victory."`
`"Au?"`
`"What nonsense is your priestess spouting? How can she possibly save the world in this situation?!"`
`"Khihihihihi! I want to know! I super want to know!"`
`"I'm the one who wants to know! It's already too late. The world's ending! How are we going to save this world now...?!"`
`"......Hey. How can you not understand? Have you forgotten how this is used?"`
`"Au? You're going to hack open Une's head with the knife?"`
`"If she were not a god, I would command you to behead Une, indeed!"`
`"You two both have your heads filled with cream-free cream puffs. I'll teach you how this knife is used... right now."`
`"Oh? And what do you totally think you're doing?"`
`"The cause of your defeat was revealing to me your true identity and whereabouts."`
`"Huh?! You know where Une is right now?! How do you know when even Tamura doesn't?!"`
`"S-Still, even if you did know, you've gotta know there's nothing you can do if she's not here."`
`"It doesn't matter where she is right now. Back then, she was here in Okinomiya. That's all I need to know."`
`"What are you saying? I super don't get it."`
`"Let me tell you something.`
` You're going to lose...`
`Because you made me mad."`
`Let's go back...`
`Back to the moment Une became aware of the other Une and awakened her on this planet.`
`It was the day before Takano started spreading η173.`
`Since Une had just awoken, her presence was still faint.`
` Tamura had yet to grasp her whereabouts.`
`Une had learned how weak Tamura's roots were,`
` and she was making preparations to bloom at once and spread her people everywhere.`
`Tamura had given up on discovering Une's whereabouts and welcomed Takano as her priestess,`
` to prepare her bitter plan of stopping Une's explosive spread.`
`Her plan of having Takano`
` spread η173 before Une could.`
`Which meant that at present,`
` neither Une nor Takano had spread anything at all.`
` The world had yet to reach the point of no return.`
`In other words,`
` if Une's ambition could be halted on this day, then it would all end before it started......`
`But that was impossible.`
` Without a time machine!`
`"......Khihihi! I've super woken up. ......I couldn't fool Tamurahime-no-Mikoto, but that doesn't matter. I don't need to worry about someone with such weak roots as I move on to take over this planet and super consume it! Super khihihihihihihihi...!"`
`Une's ambition of conquering the world with her people was born here in this small town of Okinomiya in rural Japan.`
`No one in the world had noticed this terrifying resolve just yet.`
` However.`
`"Khihihi......`
`Hi......?"`
`"Good afternoon. Are you Une-chan? Are you......?"`
`"......Who, are you......?"`
`"Rena, did you find her?!`
` Ohh, this must be her!"`
`"Ohh, it is, it is! She looks exactly like she did in the portrait!"`
`"Rika's pretty good at drawing, isn't she? I'm quite surprised!"`
`The older girl with a ponytail held up a sketchbook with a portrait that looked exactly like me.`
`I was suddenly surrounded and didn't understand why.`
`"......I finally found you, Une."`
`"Wh, Who might you be......?"`
`"Our first time meeting would normally be some weeks from now. But I only met you just the other day. Well, while I say just the other day, I mean several months ago. I only had today to find you, so I had a hard time searching for you, Une!"`
`"Fufufu! You shouldn't underestimate me and Rika, Une!! We've already seen your ambition for world conquest!"`
`"......H-How, did you see through my ambition?!"`
`"See? The leader of the horned people and her priestess aren't so powerless or incompetent after all, huh? It's just so tiresome it wears on the patience a bit, but from my point of view, you're the incompetent one. Heeheeheehee!"`
`"Flash! This is the ancient god-binding treasure normally kept in the Furude Shrine's ritual storehouse!"`
`"Now, everyone! Bind her up in this sacred rope! Nipah♪"`
`"......Y-You're binding me in circles!`
` Ahhhh!!"`
`"Ohh! To think you'd find Une so easily when I couldn't uncover her! You have my thanks, children of man!"`
`"You've shown yourself, Tamurahime-no-Mikoto!"`
`"By the way, you're equally guilty. If you'd just let go of your pride and asked us for help, you wouldn't have needed to cause such a huge disaster in the first place."`
`"I am the proud Tamurahime-no-Mikoto! Know that I would never indebt myself to the savage and tainted horned people!"`
`"That's why you're just as guilty.`
`Flash!!"`
`"W-What?!!`
` The god-binding treasure?!!`
` Ahhh!!"`
`"Now we've captured all the ringleaders of this commotion! Au!"`
`"This was a tragedy that could've been prevented if you and Tamura weren't on bad terms in the first place. You said the two of you fought over a single meal, right?"`
`"It's not my fault! Tamura shouldn't have been so stingy! She had so much being offered to her! It wouldn't have hurt her to share a bit with me!"`
`"In other words, you stole it from her.`
` So you're just as guilty!`
`Flash!!!"`
`"Is this why you brought three sacred ropes with you?!`
` Ahhh!!!"`
`"We heard the whole story from Rika-chan. ......You're all gods, right? I wish you'd give a little consideration to the humans you're endangering."`
`"It's good that we prevented it ahead of time. ......But this might have turned into a terrible disaster, you know?"`
`"It wasn't just terrible. I experienced it firsthand."`
`"Anyway! It's not good for us if you gods don't get along with each other."`
`"Still, they're awfully cute gods, aren't they? ......I imagined they'd have much scarier faces."`
`"Auauau! I am Oyashiro-sama! This treatment isn't fair!"`
`"Why you, children of man! It is outrageous to show me such disrespect and call me cute!"`
`"How did you know about my ambition to conquer the world?! I totally can't accept this!"`
`"Une-chan, why were you plotting to destroy our world in the first place?"`
`"Because we super love consuming everything!"`
`"So then what about after you've consumed and ruined everything? How long does it take you to find a new planet?"`
`"Hmm........."`
`"It takes long enough to drive you crazy, doesn't it? And I'm betting you're feeling lonely that whole time, aren't you? Aren't you?"`
`".........Nnnnnh...... But...... Tamura told me to get out...... That super ticked me off...... At first I thought about living here peacefully......"`
`"Tamura's bullying is the root of all evil!"`
`"You all would have made the fatal mistake of letting Une escape the city!"`
`"So in short, Une decided to destroy the world because Tamurahime-no-Mikoto told her to get off this planet."`
`"......Yes, that's right......"`
`"So then Tamura-chan refused to talk to Hanyuu-chan or Oyashiro-sama about it because they fought, and decided to resolve it herself using terrible methods."`
`"I didn't want to borrow any help from the tainted people!"`
`"Yet the whole reason they're on bad terms in the first place, is because Hanyuu-san stole some of her offerings, right?"`
`"It's my fault?! I can't believe you're treating me like I'm the main cause of all this! Auauau!!"`
`"Yes, yes, quiet!! We've heard the defendants' excuses! To sum up, you're all at fault because you three couldn't get along!"`
`"Une-chan finally made it here to Earth after her long, isolated journey too. I think Tamura-chan could have tried to accept her a bit more. Just a bit."`
`"And Tamurahime-no-Mikoto, I can understand you might resent her for eating your offering. But to stay on bad terms for a thousand years and then refuse to consult her or ask for her help in a time of need, only to ultimately take drastic actions on your own, isn't very praiseworthy either, you know?"`
`"For starters, this whole problem became more complicated because Hanyuu-san just refused to apologize."`
`"No one should get that mad over just one meal!!"`
`"I will never reconcile with that starving, empty-headed, cream puff!!"`
`"I just wanted you to share a little bit of this flower bed with me. Yet you bullied me, Tamura!"`
`"See, see, did you see?! This really is all Tamura's fault!"`
`"Une is a devil that would destroy everything! Une is the one to blame for all this!!"`
`"......I think Tamura's hatred for the other races all started when Hanyuu went and stole food from her. If Hanyuu hadn't done that, then Tamura wouldn't hate outsiders, and she might have accepted me."`
`"Mhmm, you know that is exactly right!! This cream puff for brains is the cause of all this!!"`
`"I refuse to be treated like I'm the one to blame!!!"`
`"Argh! Silennnnce!!`
` Now, we'll hand out the verdict!!`
`All three of you are equally guilty of the crime for failing to get along, so your punishment is having to play games in our club!!"`
`"Heehee. The three of you can happily play games together and deepen your camaraderie, so you can all forgive and forget when it matters most. Consider this a generous sentence from the priestess of the Furude shrine."`
`"Hohohoho! You'll just be deepening your friendship over some fun games!"`
`"Once you've all had fun enjoying the same experiences, I'm sure you'll get along better! I'm sure!"`
`"It won't just be you gods either! We humans will join in too, to really make this a lively affair!"`
`"However! ......We club members never take it easy on opponents, do we? Kukukukuku!!"`
`"We'll have to show you plenty of our gratitude for getting us humans caught up in your fight between gods!!"`
`"It's no fun when you gods fight by yourselves and we can't participate! So we'll take this opportunity to teach all three of you that you shouldn't take humans lightly, okay? Nihihi!"`
`"What fools! We are gods! We will not be defeated in the mere games of man!"`
`"I'll totally never be defeated by mere humans. Kfufufu!"`
`"Oh-ho? So you humans are challenging the gods?`
`Then we won't hold back either!"`
`Tamurahime-no-Mikoto was a steady player.`
` Her style focused on defense more than offense, so she should've been a tough opponent.`
`Une was likely to toy with us magnificently using her sly tricks and fluid adaptability.`
`Then Hanyuu had her indecipherable dumb luck.`
` She was the greatest opponent in a game involving chance!`
`They were still gods.`
` There was no reason for them to lose a game to humans.`
`However...`
` when it came to games, the club members weren't human either!`
`"Well, since Tamura-chan's the dealer, she discards first."`
`"Fufufu!`
` Know the powerful luck of the gods!!`
` I am discarding a green dragon and declaring double riichi!"`
`"Pardon me!`
` Hand of man,`
` all green,`
` four concealed triplets, single wait!`
` That's four yakuman,`
` or 128,000 points!!"`
`"Ron for me too!`
` Hand of man,`
` seven pairs,`
` red, red, dora, dora,`
` so just a simple yakuman`
` for 32,000 points!!"`
`"Wha?!`
` W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Wha?!?!"`
`"Hey, Tamura. It's still too early to cry. Triple rons are allowed, right?"`
`"Then a ron for me too!`
` Hand of man,`
` big four winds,`
` all honors,`
` four concealed triplets, single wait.`
` That's six yakuman straight from you`
` for 192,000 poiiiiints!!"`
`"3-352,000 straight from me?!?!`
` T-That's impossible!`
` Gyawawahn!!"`
`"Ohhohoho!! There's not enough to pay that, even if we collected all the point sticks from the table!!"`
`"Now!! Here's your punishment game outfit---!!!"`
`"I-I don't understand why I must bear such disgrace!!"`
`"Nipah! Poor thing, poor thing."`
`"Still, this is an incredible outfit.`
` What's it even from?"`
`"Nipah!`
` It's a dream collaboration with Blahblahblah so she can pretend to be an adult pro-wrestler!"`
`"Tada!`
` Now I'm out!"`
`"Ohhohoho!`
` I'm out now too!"`
`"I-I'm just one card away from totally being out......!"`
`"Hold it!`
` You didn't say uno!!"`
`"Gyawa?!`
` Super gyawawahn!!"`
`"And there, I'm out too!"`
`"Now I'm out too, nipah!"`
`"So, now I'm out!`
` Looks like last place goes to Une-chan!!"`
`"T-This! This outfit is super embarrassing on me!!"`
`"Nipah! Poor thing, poor thing."`
`"This is another cruel outfit.`
` What is this one from?"`
`"It's an indecent outfit that came up when I googled 'embarrassing outfits'.`
` Nipah!"`
`"You won't take me down like you did those two. Auau!!"`
`"Now, let the game begin! Will the wolf please raise your head. Now, the fortune teller, please raise your head."`
`"Okay!`
` I'm revealing myself! I'm the fortune teller!`
` Hanyuu-chan is the wolf!!"`
`"Auauau?!?!"`
`"So then with a unanimous vote, our sacrifice for the first day is..."`
`"Decided!`
` We're hanging Hanyuuuuu!!"`
`"I-I didn't even get to participate in the gaaaaaaame!!"`
`"Kukuku! Now to have Hanyuu-chan change into her punishment outfit too!"`
`"Stop it!`
` You're planning to make me wear something indecent, aren't you?!`
`Like something from an erotic doujinshi!`
` Like something from an erotic doujinshi!!"`
`"............Au."`
`"I promise the three of us gods will get along now! So spare us already!"`
`"I'm super repenting too!"`
`"Hau~!!! So kyute!! I'm taking you home~!!!"`
`"...........................`
`I,`
` .........I won't accept this!!"`
