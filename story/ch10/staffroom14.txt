`Hello, Ryukishi07 here.`
`If you're reading this now, then I believe you've read all of the chapters.`
`It truly has been a long journey.`
` Thank you for sharing all of it with us.`
`My life has changed dramatically since I first announced Higurashi When They Cry.`
`So many people have fallen in love with Higurashi When They Cry and created many derivative works, and both my outlook on creation and the breadth of what I create have changed a lot.`
`I've met many wonderful people thanks to Higurashi When They Cry,`
` and I've learned how blessed I am to have such wonderful people around me.`
`I also believe that all of you are now walking different paths in life since Higurashi was created ten years ago.`
`"Thanks to Higurashi When They Cry, I got married, and we had a child, and our family took a trip to Shirakawa-go together."`
`"Thanks to Umineko When They Cry, I'm getting married. Would it be alright if we used the one winged eagle motif on our rings and welcome board?"`
`"Because of 07th's works, I'm now getting married to someone from a completely different nation."`
`These are just some of the e-mails I've received.`
`I never imagined that my titles could have such a huge influence on the life of someone else.`
`It makes me happy with all my heart, and I feel honored.`
`If the long, long story of Higurashi can be a part of the lives of the many people who have supported us, as well as my own,`
`then nothing could make me happier.`
`Of course life is filled with both sweet moments and bitterness.`
`Since announcing Higurashi When They Cry, I've met and parted with many people, and experienced many things both fun and sad.`
` I've both felt grateful to be alive, and depressed at the thought of living any longer. `
`There really have been so many things that have happened over the years.`
`Higurashi When They Cry is without a doubt a piece of my life.`
`While I'm truly happy to announce that once more in this shape, there's also a satisfaction I can hardly express.`
`For however brief a moment it was, I have been able to share this piece of my life with all of you.`
`Nothing can ever beat that joy.`
`So I'd like to take this chance to offer my deepest gratitude to all of you who have supported me up until this day.`
`Without your support, Ryukishi07 could not have kept writing this long.`
`Yes.`
` You all are the reason I'm alive here today.`
`So I would like to offer you all my sincerest gratitude.`
`That is why I have given this edition the title, "Hou", or "offering".`
`So please, I hope you all will accept these thanks from me.`
`Now, with our dedication to the past complete, I would like to discuss the future.`
`Up until now I have continued to release a new title at every Comic Market held twice a year for over ten years straight.`
`Those ten years of my youthful days were like a summer vacation - though every moment was fulfilling, they all flew by in the blink of an eye.`
`While I used to have both plenty of stamina and willpower, I've hit my forties without even realizing it.`
`I've already dedicated all of the youth I could spare shaving away at sleep and pushing my body to its limits as I did back when creating Higurashi.`
`Retire?`
` Of course not.`
` I haven't lost my interest and passion for creating new titles yet.`
`I just need to adjust my lifestyle to one more befitting my age.`
`I touted the idea of "announce a new title at every Comiket held twice a year"`
`as if it was a supreme command for the past ten years.`
`However, the amount of work involved in adding production effects to that much text and debugging it all `
`is something neither myself nor our reliable staff and few companions are young enough to continue doing as we once did.`
`That was when I realized something.`
`What everyone reading my titles is looking for isn't "producing a new one twice a year", is it?`
`There was a reason I continued to focus on releasing twice a year.`
`"It was only a lucky fluke, and if I at least continue to produce two new titles a year, then people will remember me......"`
`That was the reason, or the sense of threat that loomed over me.`
`When I produced Higurashi When They Cry Hou this time,`
` I finally felt like I had the chance to be free of the way I lived my twenties and thirties, a chance to be free of the "twice a year" curse, `
`and above all, the chance to forgive myself.`
`Thanks to all of your support, I've managed to be where I am today.`
`My life until now has passed by far too fast, like I was in a short distance race.`
`But I can't be grateful enough to all of you who gave me such a thrilling life.`
`I hope to spend the next ten or twenty years returning the favor to you all.`
`Though I still haven't figured out exactly how to do that yet.`
`But then I thought, perhaps my way of returning that favor is to`
` "continue producing new titles, even if it's not two per year."`
` Yes, I think it is.`
`But I'm still a little worried.`
`If I stop producing two titles a year, will everyone forget about me?`
`To be honest, I'd rather run from that fear by holding to my conviction of announcing two new titles per year, even if it meant I might collapse tomorrow.`
`But the time for such forced endurance is long past, and I'm at a point where I need to hold firm to reevaluating myself.`
`If I were allowed to ask one selfish thing,`
`then please, please... while I can't promise when it will be, I'd like to see you all again in whatever my next title ends up being.`
`I don't know what my next title will be, what shape it will take, or when it will be announced.`
`It pains me that I can't promise anything about it.`
`But there is one thing I can promise with my very soul.`
`And that...`
`is that I will not stop continuing to produce new titles.`
`I definitely want to repay you all for giving me the opportunity and the willpower to write so many things.`
`So even if that's all I can promise...... I want to promise you at least that.`
`My next title might not be limited to visual novels.`
`I might return to 07th Expansion's roots and announce a non-electric game.`
`Perhaps I might announce my involvement in a professional title like Visual Arts-san's Rewrite.`
`Or perhaps it will be something completely new that I can't even imagine right now.`
`But I definitely, definitely`
` want to continue creating something that you all can enjoy.`
`Starting next year, perhaps it'll be a marathon instead of a short-distance race.`
`It might prove difficult even doing even one Comiket release per year.`
`But writing and creating is something I'll never stop doing.`
`So please wait for me.`
`For whatever, and whenever the next When They Cry comes.`
`I hope you'll wait patiently for me.`
`This has grown long now, but thank you very much for putting up with my selfishness......`
`Now, I have one announcement at the end.`
`This is regarding the public event hosted every year, the 07th Party.`
` I'm not really sure when the next one will be held after the one being hosted this October.`
`Maybe that could end up being the last one......`
`But with that in mind, I would like to see everyone one more time and express my gratitude.`
`I truly would.`
`I'm sorry this is becoming something of an advertisement, but please, it would be really nice if you could make it.`
`I'm sorry for such serious talk that makes it sound like I could die at any minute.`
`I'm perfectly healthy right now.`
`My motivation for creating new titles hasn't dwindled at all.`
`After all, the only way for me to see all of you again, is for me to keep creating new titles.`
`I'd like to truly thank you very much`
`for supporting Higurashi all this time.`
`Up until today, the support I've received from you all has kept me moving forward.`
`So from today onward, I'll be doing my best to repay you all.`
`So, with that turning point in mind, I'm hoping to change my life around a little bit.`
`I'm truly grateful to you for accompanying me through such long text.`
`I hope that someday, in the not too distant future,`
`we're able to meet again in another title.`
`I plan to make that title`
`a story I offer to all of you reading this now.`
