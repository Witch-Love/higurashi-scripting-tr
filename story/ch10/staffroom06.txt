`07th Expansion, Emergency Manual 1`
`If spontaneous, eccentric behavior is detected within the staff, then the head of this circle must take rapid control of the situation before the staff commits abnormal acts in public. `
`However, great care must be placed on maintaining secrecy.`
`Emergency Manual, Appendix 9, FAQ`
`Question: If Ryukishi07 screams out and shouts, "Did you know, Raiden?!"`
` "You seem confident in your martial arts.`
` But can you withstand`
` my ultimate technique?!"`
` or something similar, I presume the appropriate response is to hit him in the back of the head with a heel kick, but can each individual make that call?`
`Answer: Yes, it is as you surmised.`
`Question: If Yatazakura begins farming Nine Tails in the 5th floor of Payon Dungeon the moment I take my eyes off him, `
`I believe we should immediately administer disciplinary action, but is it okay for me to load up my Blacksmith as well and provide said discipline via DM?`
`Answer: It is inappropriate to provide discipline via online games.`
`Question: When BT discovers a typo, hearing all the staff repeat off that typo causes considerable decline in morale, so can Ryukishi07 prohibit this?`
` It's very humiliating having everyone mutter, "Fmmm, fmmm"...`
`Answer: All will be well when you turn that humiliation into pleasure.`
`Question: Apparently Tokika's got his aura recently, but I'm sure 2M exp per hour from Stings is impossible. `
`He has to be cheating or using a bot, so I reported to him to the admins, but they don't do anything regardless of how often I report him.`
` Was it designed that way?`
`Answer: Yes, it is as you surmised.`
`Question: Apparently Ectarina's started playing PangYa recently,`
` but she keeps saying nonsense like, "Pangya~~☆!" or "I screwed up the TomBack~~ (>w<;)" but should I open my own PangYa account to gain a better understanding? `
`She also said something about lacking the PP to buy Kooh's Gymnastic Set.`
`Answer: Stop complaining and get to work.`
`Question: In the JS*F books that I-san brought us to use as reference material for the script, there are dangerous red stamps like, `
`"Taking off premises prohibited," or "Be sure to destroy," but is it safe to use these documents?`
`Answer: I'm just a good-intentioned outsider, nipah☆`
`Question: While writing the "Minagoroshi Chapter", Ryukishi07 bought many different games, but will they actually contribute to the script?`
`Answer: Sengoku Basara introduces the strength of unified groups.`
` Beat Down introduces the importance of gathering allies.`
` Shadow of the Colossus introduces the courage to fight against ginormous enemies.`
`Brothers in Arms introduces how to fight alongside allies.`
`And Shinobido: Way of the Ninja teaches that it's not always smart to agitate things, along with the importance of a powerful blue flame that carries matters out very quietly.`
`<size=-4>Man, that was one of the most fun ninja games I've played. `
`Setting up stealth landmines in advance along the enemy's path and using gunpowder and grenades specialized in knockout to launch a surprise attack from the flank on an ox cart guarded by heavily armored Taraba was the first time I've felt such thrills and excitement in an FPS! `
`Man, silent killing everyone from behind for a whole procession in charge of delivering important papers was intense!`
` I had to silence all seven in under ten seconds without anyone noticing, including the guards!`
` That was truly being a shinobi!!`
` I definitely recommend it to those who prefer sniping over assaults in FPS, or those who prefer Assassin's Creed over Medal of Honor.`
`I'll also admit it contributed a lot to writing the Minagoroshi Chapter.`
` Wait...`
` Uwaaah, what am I doing?!`
` Khaawsedrftgyfjklp;`
`"Hello, this is Ryukishi07.`
` ...Man, the final hell lasted a long time this time around!`
` Thanks for your hard work, everyone---!!`
` ...Though as I'm typing this, we're right in the final stages. `
`All I can hear are the groans of men thoroughly exhausted by this hell."`
`"......Hello, this is Yatazakura, nya.`
` ...If we actually manage to get this chapter out in time for Winterket, then that's all thanks to us, nya...`
` Ryukishi-san works too slow...`
` ...Thmp..."`
`"Fmmm~ Fmmm~.`
` Hello, this is BT.`
` If I wasn't keeping an eye out, Higurashi would be in terrible shape.`
` Fmmm, fmmm."`
`"To all the staff here, thank you very much for always doing this...`
` Higurashi is safely going public thanks to all of you--!!"`
`Thanks to everyone, we're able to safely deliver Higurashi When They Cry Chapter 7.`
` This is all thanks to everyone who's supported us.`
` You have the heartfelt gratitude of all of us on staff at 07th Expansion.`
`There's only one chapter of Higurashi When They Cry left.`
` Just the Matsuribayashi chapter.`
` We plan to do our best to make it worth reading as the final tie-off for this long story.`
`So please, we hope you'll stick with us until the end of this tale.`
`And thank you very much for reading through this disgraceful behind-the-scenes staff room.`
`We hope you'll continue to support us in the future.`
`07th Expansion.`
