`"And so, it's finally time for our staff room!!`
` Once I'm done typing out this text, I'm finished!!`
` So with that, hello, this is Ryukishi07."`
`"...You're taking too much time typing out this silly text.`
` This is Yatazakura, nya."`
`"Now then.`
` The main people behind the production of Higurashi When They Cry are myself,`
` Ryukishi07, and Yatazakura, but of course we're not producing this title with just the two of us."`
`"Of course not, nya.`
` We need to be grateful to the others helping us, nya."`
`"And so!`
` In today's staff room, I'd like to introduce everyone!!`
` The first two we need to introduce are 4U-san and BT-san!!!`
` Go on, go ahead, go ahead, you two!"`
`"Hello there~ This is 4U."`
`"BT here."`
`"4U-san, BT-san, thank you for always, always helping to support our devil-may-care Ryukishi07 from behind the scenes, nya."`
`"Now, 4U-san is the one originally in charge of managing our circle's website, and BT-san is the second generation site manager."`
`"On top of that, he's created a great deal of the foundational system for Higurashi When They Cry, nya.`
` We're incredibly grateful, nya..."`
`"4U-san has now started his solo career as an original card designer!!`
` We're praying for the future success of his career!!`
` I'm looking forward to a Tsukihime card sheet!!!`
` Especially Akiha!`
` Akihaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"In addition to helping with production of Higurashi When They Cry,`
` BT-san manages our homepage, our printing, and even offers advice on management policies for our circle, nya."`
`"Without the help of 4U-san and BT-san, Higurashi When They Cry wouldn't be possible.`
` We're truly grateful!!!"`
`"......Are you truly grateful, nya?`
` If those two abandon us, our circle is finished in more ways than one, nya."`
`"Of course I am!!`
` I'm grateful to the max!!`
` Magistrate, here are some golden yellow sweets for you!!`
` And of course, you'll find some Fukuzawa Yukichi-sans at the bottom of the box!!"`
`"......One, two, three."`
`"Ryukishi-san~ this isn't quite enough.`
` Or rather, please pay our expenses. Our expenses.`
` There's the printing costs,`
` R's bill,`
` our necessary expenses, and so forth.`
` Oh, do you need an invoice?"`
`"W-W-What?!`
` In that case, allow me to present this naughty illustration of Rika x Satoko personally penned by me instead..."`
`".........Please continue to support our no good Ryukishi07 from here on out as well, nya.`
` ...Bow."`
`Man, I really am grateful to those two...`
` ...Please don't abandon us... >.<`
`"Now then!!`
` The next to introduce is Tokika-san!! `
`He's offered us advice since the early planning stages for Higurashi When They Cry, and he's the leader of the test play shock troops who read the first draft of the scenario and gave us his impression!! `
`......Go on, Tokika-san, say hello~~!"`
`"......I've got a guild meetup today, so I can't spend too much time here."`
`"Now, now~ ...Don't say that, just give us a few comments~~..."`
`"I'm heading to GD2 with my guildmates now, so later.`
` Oh, sorry, move!`
` I've got a customer buying Elu!"`
`"......To think this is the man who once cleared Einhander on hard mode,`
` the same hardcore shooter who passed through Ace Combat 4's Megalith at 1200kph.`
` ...Online games are terrifying, nya."`
`"Well then let's move on!`
` Next is someone who has helped us with various particular details since Higurashi When They Cry's early days, Ecatari~na-san!"`
`"=w=) Kuunyan☆`
` This is Ecatarina."`
`"Ecatari~na-san, thank you as well for always helping us at the last minute with work that's down to the wire.`
` Please continue to keep watch over our circle...`
` So, with that, go ahead with your comment."`
`"I'm this close to learning Snap~!`
`Throw Spirit Sphere's strong! It's fun~!`
`If the Stings kill me, Res me please!`
`Unyan! >w<b"`
`".........That comment had nothing to do with Higurashi at all, nya.`
` Once again, online games are terrifying, nya."`
`"Now, now!`
` Let's keep moving right along!!`
` Next up is our superhero from K-Bureau, 2nd Division!!`
` Kameya Mannendou-san~!!"`
`"Kameya Mannendou-san is Yatazakura's coworker, nya.`
` By the way, K-Bureau, 2nd Division is also their circle's name, and the members of it all work at the same office, nya."`
`"Hello!`
` Kameya here!!"`
`"From Comiket tickets to tickets reserved only for family members of the squadmen to attend the Air Self Defense Force's aerial show, his mysterious ability to obtain anything is hot! `
`I bet he's proud of the broad network he's built!!"`
`"There's something more important that we should be saying first, nya.`
` Congratulations on getting married, nya~~~!!!"`
`"Congratulations on getting married!!!`
` May you both have long lasting happiness!!!`
` Though we're counting on your support next Summerket!!`
` Oh yeah!!"`
`"Next is Tokika-san's friend, Usui-san, nya.`
` ............Though we can't get any comment from him because he's off farming GD2 with Tokika-san, nya."`
`"Hmm, online games are terrifying!!!"`
`"He's a very polite and shy boy, yet in the world of RO, his personality does a 180 and he becomes awfully wild, nya."`
`"Online games are terrifying!!"`
`"Moving onward, we have Naruse Tsubaki-san, nya.`
` He's Ryukishi07's friend in real life, nya.`
` By the way, I've always wondered about this, but why is Naruse Tsubaki-san credited as 'Eyes' in our staff roll, nya?"`
`"Well...`
` I had some good image data left over from when he asked me to do some trimming on his family photo a while back, you see ☆ `
`So I did a little tweaking to it here and there to create those 'eyes' used in Watanagashi-hen☆ Teehee☆"`
`".........What a work of human rights violations and ignoring copyright laws regarding unauthorized usage, nya."`
`"Now then.`
` There are still many, many more people I'm grateful to, but I'd really, really like to thank you all for your support!!!`
` You have my deep, deep gratitude!!!"`
`"...Ryukishi-san, you're forgetting one person you should be thankful for, nya."`
`"Oh? Who's that?"`
`".................."`
`".........?"`
`"......I'm not helping you with the next Higurashi, nya..."`
`"...Ah... Ahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Right, right!`
` Let me introduce Yatazakura-san as well~!!`
` Yatazakura-san is one of the central figures behind Higurashi When They Cry. `
`The whole project started when he said he wanted to create a Visual Novel of some kind after studying up on N-Scripter!!"`
`"Between the scripting and coding production effects, in a nutshell I'm the one who gets tossed around the most by Ryukishi07's ideas and whims, nya."`
`"Unh, I'm always grateful to you~~!!`
` You and I are the team that's built Higurashi up to what it is today, aren't we~!!"`
`"Mhmm, mhmm.`
` As long as you understand that, nya.`
` Mfufu!"`
`"Hey, hey, Yatazakura-san, since we're at it... introduce me too~~!"`
`"......Hmm, hmm, nya.`
` Then we'll introduce Ryukishi07 next, nya.`
` He's in charge of writing the script, drawing the artwork, and being selfish, nya."`
`"T-T-Thank you.`
` I'm Ryukishi07."`
`"It doesn't matter at this point, but Ryukishi-san, you're taking too long to write the staffroom.`
` I wish you'd hurry up and finish typing out this text, nya."`
`"S-S-Sorry..."`
`"And also, why does creating Higurashi always have to come down to the wire like this, nya?!`
` I wish you'd get your work done in a more timely manner, nya!"`
`"Au~ I'm always sorry~~~~!!"`
`"I mean, if you have time to waste dragging your heels here, then hurry up and start writing the next chapter, Meakashi, nya!!`
` I refuse to go through a repeat of last year's winter, nya!!! `
`Are you actually listening, nya?!`
` If sorry was enough, we wouldn't need police, nya!!`
` Are you listening to me, nya?!`
` Fngggaaaah!!!"`
`"Mnnnnnngh...... I kept quiet to listen, but you just keep going on!!`
` I'm trying my hardest over here too!`
` I don't want to hear it from you~~!!"`
`"Oho? You're getting defiant now, nya?!`
` Then let's take this to PvP, huh?!`
` In the Nightmare Dungeon, of course, nya!!`
` Don't worry, I'll go with my 1st Job Class Swordman, nya☆"`
`"Nowaaah?!`
` But Yatazakura-san, your swordman can beat gryphons solo, can't it?!`
` Well, in that case I'll just go borrow Ekate-san's Critical Priest..."`
`"Why don't you use your own character instead of borrowing someone else's, nya?`
` ......Have you actually raised that STR Assassin you were boasting about before, nya?"`
`"...............Well`
` ......I managed to become a Thief... yeah?"`
`"............Not an Assassin?"`
`"........................"`
`"...You borrowed a Mocking Manteau,`
` and you borrowed Sohee Shoes,`
` and you made it up to the wall.`
` ...Then you got discouraged, nya?"`
`".....................T-This is the age of shooting games now!!!`
` The Touhou series ruuuules!!`
` At any rate, I back Marisa x Patchouli!!`
` That pairing did me in!! `
`Patchouli's, 'Was what you did with me all an illusion...?' had me swooning~!!!`
` Of course I'm super excited for the Touhou fighting game too!! `
`Oh, oh, and of course I'm looking forward to Ragnarok Battle Offline too!!!`
` Long live doujin gaaaaaames!!! `
`Personally I'd like to hold off on producing Higurashi for a bit to create a Touhou fan product, but can we?!`
` Can we?!`
` Please~ Please~ Yatazakura-san~~☆"`
`"Once again, Ryukishi07-san has set off on a journey to the eternal world, so I'll be wrapping things up this time as well, nya."`
`We're truly grateful that you've decided to purchase Higurashi When They Cry.`
`We're also truly grateful to all of those who supported us, and all of those who helped us produce Higurashi When They Cry.`
`We'd like to continue giving Higurashi When They Cry our best, so please share your comments with us.`
`　　　　　　　　　　　　July 30th, 2004`
`　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ryukishi07 & Yatazakura`
`"I swear I saw it!!`
` There was a Blacksmith in a Deviruchi Hat named Ryuugu Rena selling Elunium 1K cheaper than I was!!`
` Why am I, the creator of Higurashi, being undersold by my own character?!!! `
`It's time for PvP, argh!"`
`"Be quiet, nya!!`
` If you have time to play online games, then get to writing the next script, nya!!!`
` Uraaah!!`
` Starry Bash Bash~~!!!"`
`"Hiiiii! It's a real life PK------!!!"`
