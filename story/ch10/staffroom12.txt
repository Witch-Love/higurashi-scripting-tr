`"Good evening. This is Ryukishi07.`
` Nhooooooooh!!`
` Yatazakura-san, Yatazakura-san!!`
` How many left today?!`
` How many days are left until Summerket nooooooow?!"`
`"Good evening.`
` This is Yatazakura.`
` Uhooooooooooh!!`
` Ryukishi-san, Ryukishi-san!!`
` Today's August 11th, nya!!`
` The first day of Summerket is August 15th, so... Waooooooooh!!`
` A whole four days!! `
`We have 96 hours left, nyaaa!!!"`
`"That's a huge difference from last time!!`
` We can do it if we try!!`
` Completing the game with time to spare!!`
` That's... being an adult!!`
` That's making doujin games as an adult!!`
` Hooraaaaaaaay!!"`
`"Auuuah...`
` But I have a few mixed feelings again this time, nya...`
` I need to do plenty of error checking..."`
`"Once you're done error checking, let's print.`
` Then we'll put the label stickers on the printed CDs.`
` Then we'll need to put a little thought into our counter layout... `
`...Last time we forgot even the tablecloth... It was a really pathetic display..."`
`"For starters... the world of doujinshi software is harsher than that of doujinshi manga, nya..."`
`"Yeah.`
` With manga you can stand there, read a sample, and get a general idea before buying, so they're extremely low risk purchases, but you can't do that with software..."`
`"There's nothing hidden with CG collections, nya.`
` What you see is what you get there, nya."`
`"But with novel games like ours... how are you supposed to promote them...?`
`From what I've heard, even big Tsukihime-sama saw hardly anyone pick it up when it was first released in its half-moon version... At least that's the story..."`
`"The only thing you can do is to work hard and make a good game...`
` so that way you can build up trust, nya."`
`".........Nnh... But it's every creator's biggest dream to have lots of people play their games, you know...`
` My first solo debut at Comiket... was a very sad reality......"`
`That... was some Summerket I don't remember...`
`I was worn out from how busy my main job was, and I spent my time day in and day out just waiting for night to come. `
`......I spent those days just constantly afraid as time for myself kept slipping through my fingers...`
`That was when I was drawn to a "Recruiting Members" ad written in the colophon of a doujinshi I picked up in Yatazakura-san's room... and I started doing doujin work under a different penname than I use now.`
`We all got along well enough...... and I drew up a modest manuscript......`
`Then after gaining advice and help from a lot of different people, I sent it to press and printed 200 copies of my first offset doujinshi...`
`I've been showing modest results now, so we make it through Comiket's selection, but... back then they were cold to me...`
`I'll never forget the sadness I felt when the rejection letter came after I'd sent it to press...`
`In the end, the circle I was with at the time showed me kindness...... and I managed to get my book on display there...`
` .........but thinking back on it now... it would've been better if I hadn't.`
`Summerket sees... tens, no hundreds of thousands of people pass through...`
`...but no one would take up my book...`
`I worked so hard... I drew so much...`
`But in the end...... I only sold about five copies.`
`...I was sad.`
`...I was frustrated.`
`...I played Comic Party, and I seriously cried at Eimi's route.`
`I could have given in to despair and stopped creating anything that day.`
`But...... I wanted to play catch with the people I could only meet at Comiket... with the work I created as our ball...`
`It was just... the desire for that communication...`
`...That was my only hope............`
`"Uuuunh!`
` Ryu-tan, you worked hard and pushed through your tears too, nya...!`
` By the way, what kind of doujinshi was it that you made, nya?"`
`"I think you can find it if you search my room... but it's so embarrassing, so cut me some slack on the art..."`
`"Don't judge a book on art alone, nya!!`
` What's important is the heart, and what's inside, nya!!`
` Now, come on, tell me about it."`
`"Well, uhh...... it was a story manga.`
` An original one."`
`"Ho-ho?`
` It takes guts to create a story manga when fanfics are at the height of the doujin manga world, nya."`
`"So, well, it was also 18+..."`
`"Well, most doujin are 18+, nya.`
` So what was in it?"`
`"Well, umm, there were no gags or salvation. It was what they'd call the brute genre..."`
`"Ho-ho, so you went hardcore, nya.`
` So what situations were they in?"`
`"Well, umm, there was a woman who was being blackmailed by a bad group of people that forced her to do as they told her."`
`"Mhmm.`
` That's common, nya.`
` So then what did they tell her to do?"`
`"Uhh, well, they had her change into different outfits."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"At the time FF7's release date was getting close, and I was hooked on FF."`
`"I don't see how that relates, nya."`
`"Well, in short,`
` they made that girl change into one FF outfit after another and had sex with her."`
`"You say FF outfits, but there are so many I can't even begin to picture this, nya."`
`"Uhh, well... to trace my memory back...`
` First I had to imagine what each princess's outfit from FF 1~3 would be from the pixel art. `
`There was Rosa's outfit from FF4, then there were the Monk, Red Mage, and Dragoon outfits from FF5 with no makeup!`
`And of course there was Terra and Celes's outfits from FF6!`
`And even though it was yet to be released, they'd publicized illustrations already, so I chose to use Tifa and Aerith's oufits from FF7!!`
` What do you think?!`
` It's a Cosplay H-Manga spanning all of FF's history~~!!!`
`So the guys would have her change into the different outfits and force her to have sex with them.`
` See?!`
` See?!`
`Incredible, right?!?!"`
`".........Your friend from Vocational School, H-kun, he's with Square, right?`
` Should you really be saying this to the public?"`
`"By the way!`
` This FF chapter was only one story in the book. There was actually another story I added to it!!!`
` The other one had some content that's pretty hard to put down too, you know?!`
` Would you believe it?! `
`In contrast to the FF chapter, this one was a school uniform chapter for the general public!!!"`
`"...That sounds like something the author would love drawing, nya."`
`"In this one they take a different direction with the outfits they force her to change into!!`
` There were blazers, sailor uniforms, and several more select uniforms!`
` Of course there were PE uniforms too, nya~!!! `
`Aaaaah?!`
` I was such a fool at the time!`
` I didn't go with any school swimsuiiiiiiiits!!!"`
`"It's seriously okay for you die now, nya."`
`"Aahaah...!!`
` If I could split into two right now, I'd have the other me start drawing the third chapter in that series!!`
` Of course this time it'd be a Ragnarok chapter!!! `
`Aco-tan and Pri-tan's outfits, hahh, hahh...!`
` The hairband variation's nice too...♪`
` Of course, Kafra-tan's outfit too,`
` and Muna-tan, and Sophee-tan, hahh, hahh!! `
`And I hear Pri-tan wears striped bloomers, not panties under her outfit?!`
` Way to go, GungHoooooo!!`
` I'm going to quit my job and get a new one as a slave to Gravity!!"`
`"What an incredible display of human failure, nya.`
` ...Ryukishi-san has once more set off on a journey to the eter-no, that world, so I'll be wrapping things up again, nya."`
`We're truly grateful that you've decided to purchase Higurashi When They Cry.`

`　　　　　　　　　　　　August 11th, 2003`
`　　　　　　　　07th Expansion`

`"Next time... will be at Winterket!!`
` Even if we start production on September 1st... that's only four months, nya!!"`
`"So then, okay!!`
` The female Assassin's outfit looks like a school swimsuit, no matter how you look at it!! `
`Of course I have great expectations for the excessive exposure of the Dancer's newest advanced Class toooooooo!!!"`
`"Grit your teeth, nyaaaaaaaaaah!!`
` Noooooow!! Discipline, discipline--!!!"`
`"Hiiiiiiii!! Violent teacheeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!"`
