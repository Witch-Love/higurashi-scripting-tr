`The body... wasn't there.`
`The police didn't arrest me, because of that...`
` but I didn't know whether to feel happy about it.`
`...Just like Satoko had said... I'd... failed to kill her uncle.`
`...The body wasn't there, so I was forced to conclude as much—no matter what strange natural disaster, coincidence, or miracle it might have implied.`
`In order to free Satoko... I..... became a demon.`
`And this abnormal world was my reward... Yes, metaphorically, I had fallen into the demon world.`
`But if that price had been in exchange for the life of Satoko's uncle, then that would have been fine.`
`...Since Satoko's uncle was still alive, still shackling her to him... I needed to become a demon once again.`
`......One more time.`
`...No, as many times as it took.`
` ...I would kill that man over and over again until Satoko was liberated.`
`...I had already awoken.`
`...I looked at the clock to see that it was early in the morning, at just about five.`
` It was already light outside.`
`Once I'd hardened my resolve to become a demon again...`
` I could feel my whole body teeming with the awakened power once more.`
`Time wasn't an issue.`
` No matter what... I'd do it.`
`I got myself up.`
`...The exhaustion from the past two days was completely swept away, and I didn't even feel sleepy anymore, either.`
`I slowly rose and made sure my body was moving like I wanted it to.`
`I could feel blood flowing through each and every one of my fingers.`
`...As I got dressed, I let my mind wander... and had a strange thought.`
`These two days... while I've said it was for Satoko's sake, the only thing on my mind has been killing.`
`I've said it was for Satoko... but while actually carrying out the act, I had completely forgotten about Satoko, albeit only temporarily.`
`...Maybe, initially, it was for Satoko's sake.`
`But now, I... I was just a demon, killing for the sake of killing.`
` And as a result, I'd sunk into a world fit for such a demon.`
`...Maybe... it was the same for Satoshi.`
`He resolved himself to kill his aunt to save Satoko... became a demon... then disappeared from the sunlit Hinamizawa... vanishing into the demon world.`
`...Which meant that, after all was said and done, I'd met the same fate as him.`
`...I'd tried to avoid making the same mistakes, but it happened anyway.`
`...Which meant...... that maybe Satoshi was here.`
`Satoshi had come to this world a year before me... so he would be here somewhere.`
`Then... surprised... I stopped walking.`
`...There was the second set of footsteps I'd grown so used to hearing.`
`".........Are... could you... be Satoshi...?"`
`The empty, lifeless air wouldn't give me an answer.`
`...But I felt a strange kind of relief... that there was someone there... that Satoshi had stuck with me the whole time.`
`...Let's go, Satoshi.`
`...Once more.`
`...This time, we will set Satoko free for sure.`
`I quietly slipped out of the house so my parents wouldn't notice.`
`If they caught me now when I'd been out way too late for two days now, they'd give me a really angry talking to.`
` ...I didn't have the time to allow for that to happen.`
`Today... I would put an end to it.`
`If the dead body disappeared, then I didn't have to bury it—I could just burn it to ashes... and then take them with me, so I could kill him again every time he resurrected.`
`I'd do it again.`
` ...I'd kill him again.`
` ...And this time, I'd set her free.`
`Outside... the morning light was so beautiful as to stagger belief...`
`I went to the storage room... to find weapons with which I could kill him for sure.`
`...Blunt or not, it didn't matter to me.`
`Right now, I didn't need to care whether someone saw, or if the police came.`
`This world had gone crazy, after all.`
`A world where I'd shown up at the festival and had fun, even though I wasn't there.`
`...Even if the police arrested me, I'd probably end up going right back home as if nothing had happened.`
`......Both me and that other "Keiichi Maebara."`
`Even without me, he'd fill in.`
`...I could vanish from Hinamizawa without anyone noticing.`
`...So basically... I didn't care if I was mistakenly killed.`
`Even if I died, "Keiichi Maebara" would remain.`
`...After all... this isn't the world I belong in.`
` ...If I was going to be killed mistakenly for Satoko's sake, then that was just part of my duty as her Nii-Nii.`
`...As those desperate thoughts became serious... the morning air felt more refreshing to me, strangely enough.`
`"...Oh, this one's... scary.`
` ...Let's go with this."`
`It was... a hatchet meant for chopping thick firewood.`
`...Its hefty steel blade was sinister, almost as though it was a tool meant for killing people.`
`I couldn't exactly take it out in public like that, so I wrapped it a little in some old newspaper and tossed it into the basket on my bike.`
`"...Sorry for using you for evil all the time.`
` ...I'll need you again today, my legs."`
`I apologized to my bike for some reason.`
`...For the past three days, I've only used it for dangerous things.`
`I'd been riding this bike ever since I lived in my old town.`
`I could walk most places I wanted to go, so I hadn't used it all that much.`
`My mom had bought it for me when I entered cram school... thinking it would be a convenient way to get to the station, since it was far away.`
` ...So I'd always used it to get back and forth from cram school.`
`I'd only ever put textbooks and class materials in the front basket, too.`
`...I'd never tried to put a hatchet that I'd be using to kill someone in here.`
`...When I came to Hinamizawa, life finally felt fun.`
`I met the best friends ever, and had some of the greatest times ever.`
`...Those times... might have been shattered now, but...`
`...It was my greatest wish that I could get them back, even if I had to risk my life to do it.`
`...That's how fun those times had been.`
`I killed someone.`
`...And now I was at it again, needing to kill someone.`
`Murder was a crime.`
`...I didn't believe that people should ever think murder was okay.`
`But... still.`
` ...The times I'd had were enjoyable enough for me to commit such a crime.`
`My friends were irreplaceable, and the time spent with them a treasure.`
`...Hanging out, laughing, sometimes tricking each other, but always in a friendly way.`
`I didn't fear committing any crime, as long as it was for the sake of taking back those times that gave my heart so much pleasure.`
`Yes.`
` This was a value I'd decided to uphold.`
`...It wasn't something I learned from a school teacher.`
`...It was a noble path... that I chose for myself.`
`I thought back to when I'd first come to Hinamizawa.`
`About how on the very first day, Satoko had welcomed me via a blackboard eraser with a rock in it.`
`...That 'welcome' really surprised the heck out of me.`
`She would laugh, get angry, cry—she was never boring.`
`...She was obviously the most child-like one among us, but she was actually lively, full of vim and vigor, and good at meddling in other people's business.`
`That went for Mion, Rena, and Rika-chan too.`
` Wasn't Satoko the one at the center of everyone's laughing and banter?`
`Satoko would try to look cool.`
`Then Mion would make fun of her endlessly.`
`Then Satoko would cry, which would put Rena in a state of ecstasy.`
` Rika-chan would be greatly delighted.`
`...And I happened to get mixed up in it.`
`...We would always fool around like that.`
`...It was lonely when someone wasn't around, but if I had to name one for whom it was the worst... it would have been Satoko.`
`...Her smile was everyone's smile.`
`Ever since she stopped smiling, so did the rest of us.`
`And for the rest of us, not smiling... was the same as dying.`
`...It was just like when I was silently going to cram school every day, just to maintain my unchanging test scores.`
`So... basically, we were nothing when she wasn't smiling.`
`She was full of hot air, but she was our princess, cute and unhateable.`
`...In that case, I was her knight, searching for the dragon's castle in order to win her smile back.`
`"...Knights, of course, use swords.`
` The awesome two-handed kind!`
` ...I'm probably the only knight in the history of the world... to be taking someone on with a thick, rusty hatchet."`
`Then I saw an old person in the ridge of a field waving to me.`
`"...Oh, my!`
` Keiichi-kun!`
` Out for a morning ride, I see!"`
`"Good mooorning!!"`
`I reflexively waved back in a refreshing way.`
`...Should I really have been... feeling so happy, waving like that?`
`Satoko's house would be right past this road, going beyond the rice paddies.`
`The cicadas had woken up too... and the next thing I knew, I was the audience to their daily chorus.`
`...I gave myself a hit or two in the head... and drove away my merry morning mood.`
`I took a deep breath... then tilted my head back... quelling my pointless excitement...`
`...The body... wasn't there.`
`Its absence... either meant my killing him had been an illusion, or that I'd killed him and he'd risen from the dead.`
`...If I was at the festival... then maybe I should have considered it an illusion.`
`...Coach probably thought that way, which is why he treated me like a lunatic.`
`...But it being an illusion... was just impossible.`
`I killed him without a doubt.`
` ...Without a doubt.`
`If that had been an illusion... then that would make all of this Hinamizawa I was in right now an illusion.`
`...If that was the case, then here's how it would end up.`
`...I was actually in a vegetative state due to a traffic accident, and I was currently dreaming in a hospital bed... about how great it would be to spend time with friends in rice paddies like these. `
`...That was a terrifying thought, though.`
`...If this wasn't an illusion... then the only possible answer was that he'd resurrected.`
` ...It would make him a literal monster.`
`But... if he was such a monster... then I was no less than a monster myself.`
`...I didn't hesitate to kill someone, and... I could even wield curses.`
`Takano-san had died probably because I'd cursed her.`
`...Or maybe that was a little much.`
`...If Coach and Ooishi died too, like I'd cursed them to yesterday, then I'd believe it.`
`I set my bicycle aside... and went to take a look.`
`His motorbike wasn't here.`
`...Of course it wasn't.`
` ...I sent it down to Hell that night, throwing it into the Onigafuchi swamp.`
`......Or maybe...`
` just like how the corpse wasn't here... maybe the motorbike didn't get thrown into the swamp either...?`
`The fact his bike wasn't here... might have been because he had gone to town and hadn't come back, not necessarily because I'd thrown it into the swamp.`
`...If her uncle wasn't around, then that was convenient on its own.`
`...Then I would just show myself in, then wait for him to return, sharpening my hatchet.`
`...If... if he was there.`
`.........Forgotten sensations came back to my gut.`
`...A feeling of tension rose within me.`
`...The sensation was like poison, dulling my actions... but it could also be the trigger to allow me to awaken to my superhuman, otherworldly self.`
`I held the hatchet, still wrapped in newspaper.`
`...Its weight in my hands was profound, sinister, and reliable.`
`...I hadn't put on my watch, so I didn't know what time it was... but it was probably still a little before seven.`
`Satoko would probably be awake, preparing breakfast and her lunch.`
`...But her uncle would probably still be lazing around in bed.`
`A guy like him probably would have stayed up late drinking, and probably always slept until noon.`
`...I considered ringing the doorbell and having Satoko open the door for me... but if her uncle woke up at the sound, I'd waste my chance of him still being asleep.`
`If Satoko saw me sneaking inside without ringing the doorbell... she'd be surprised.`
`...If I ran into her... what would I say?`
`I've come to kill your uncle for you, so stay quiet.`
`...No, I couldn't do that.`
`...That would be like making Satoko responsible for his death.`
`...Be quiet and go wait outside.`
`...Maybe that would do it.`
`How would... Satoko react to that?`
`...She would probably... try and get me to give up on killing him.`
`......I would have to lie somehow to get her to go outside.`
`...Satoko didn't need to know that a murder was going to occur in this house.`
`...I couldn't quite think of a good lie to tell her... but I couldn't do much just standing around like this.`
`I made up my mind... and grabbed the doorknob...`
`Then slowly... turned it...`
` and... pulled.`
`......It wasn't locked.`
`...The gap between the door and the wall steadily grew larger.`
` ...The chain wasn't even on.`
`The oppressive smell of life in Satoko's house hit me.`
`...At the entrance... there were a few pairs of shoes and sandals.`
`...I couldn't tell whether he was here or not just by looking at them.`
`...I could hear a television on somewhere.`
`The television... was in the messy dining room.`
`...There was food scattered about the table... giving an impression decidedly different from a 'happy family's meal time.'`
`...Meals were for eating food while thanking the person for making it.`
`...Meaning whatever occurred in this dining room wasn't a meal.`
`Nobody in sight.`
`...No sign of anyone, either.`
` ...But with the television on... he must have been close.`
`...Could he have anticipated my coming and be hiding, waiting for me...?`
`...The tension I felt was so thick, so tight that I thought it would choke me.`
`The newspaper wrapping the hatchet's thick blade didn't hamper its power at all.`
`...I tightened my grip on it, then, very carefully, took a look around...`
`Where had those peaceful feelings from before I arrived here gone?`
`...Even the sound of sweat bubbling up on my brow... got on my nerves...`
`And then... I looked at the table and realized something.`
`...This wasn't breakfast.`
` The grains of boiled rice were all hard and dried up.`
`...Then... was it last night's dinner...?`
`I left the dining room, keeping vigilant... went down the hallway, and found the stairs to the second floor.`
`...When that man was playing with his friends, he looked out of a second story window.`
`...It was highly possible that room was his own, and that he slept there.`
`I tiptoed up the edges of the stairs... quietly, quietly climbing... without making a sound.`
`...I couldn't hear any kind of snoring.`
`...I didn't hear anything up there.`
`I went through a few rooms... slowly and quietly opening the paper doors... checking inside...`
` ...but I still couldn't find anyone around.`
`To search more efficiently... I got down on the floor and pressed my ear right up to it.`
`...I could hear... the television in the dining room... and a low hum, perhaps of boiling water.`
`...It was then... that I started to harbor some feelings of suspicion.`
`This house... wasn't right.`
`It seemed like people had been here, since the TV was on... but it wasn't normal for nobody to be around this early in the morning.`
`I silently descended the stairs... and went back into the dining room.`
`I looked at the food scattered about.`
`......Completely dried up rice.`
`An overturned bowl of miso soup.`
`The package for a side dish bought at the super market.`
`...I could tell Satoko had definitely been the one who made this.`
`...The food was far from Mion's perfection or Rena's gentleness... but it was sincere.`
`...Judging by how she cooked for me at my house... and from the type and amount of side dishes... I deduced the meal was from last night.`
`The numbers stamped into the food package read 83-06-20.`
`...June 20, 1983.`
` ...That was yesterday.`
`And there was food for two.`
`...Which meant... that this was last night's dinner, and Satoko's uncle would have been here then.`
`...Stop it, Keiichi.`
`...Don't even think about saying the word "impossible" again...`
`Anyway... her uncle was here last night.`
` ...That much was the truth.`
`He had found fault with Satoko's food... thrown the bowl of miso soup and flung the rest everywhere.`
`......Hidden deep within my feelings of calm and composure... was lit a flame of anger and a curse.`
`......Should I have... ever shown this man any mercy...?`
`...Bump.`
` ...Nnnnnnnnn...`
`I heard the sound again—the one from before, like a water boiler.`
` ...What was it coming from?`
`...The first floor...?`
` ......But where?`
`......The... bathroom, maybe...?`
`I could hear the noise coming from the other side of the frosted glass at the far end of the changing room.`
`...It had to have been the sound of the water boiler for the bath.`
`...Steam was enshrouding the glass door... and the heat from it was leaking into the changing room where I was standing, too.`
`...My misgivings deepened.`
`...People didn't normally take a bath this early in the morning.`
`If one did...`
` ...then it would mean... that in this house... time had been stopped ever since some moment last night.`
`Whistle, whistle, whistle...`
`Was it being reheated?`
`...The water boiler in the bathroom had been active this whole time.`
`I checked in a clothing basket... and saw Satoko's familiar uniform stuffed in it.`
`The uniform had stains and dried rice stuck to it... certainly not something she could wear today.`
`...It was probably from the miso soup at the dinner table yesterday.`
`......I looked hard at the frosted glass, but I couldn't see anything through all the steam.`
`...And then... an electric surge ran through my mind... and a terrible premonition came over me.`
`Could she.........?!?`
`She couldn't possibly have been in there since last night—that would be impossible...!!`
`...But no!`
` In Hinamizawa right now... nothing was impossible...!!`
`I gulped audibly... then quietly pulled aside the glass door.`
`...Hot, steaming air burst out of the slight opening.`
` ...The fan wasn't on in the changing room, so it went completely white with the steam.`
`...Just as the hot vapor poured into the changing room... cooler air also flowed into the room with the bath.`
`...And I just heard...`
` ...due to being hit by that air...`
` a very weak moan...`
`...That was all I needed... to know who it was.`
`"...Sa...Satokoooooo!!`
`.................."`
`No answer.`
`Satoko was in the bathtub, surrounded by a thick layer of rising steam.`
`...The top half of her body was leaning over the edge of the tub... and she was passed out.`
`The water boiler kept on making a whistling noise, as if angered.`
`...I could see the gas flame through a small window—it was roaring at full-force, completely blue.`
`Satoko's entire body... was boiled red... and flaccid, as though her bones had melted away...`
` She was... almost like a doll... as she laid there unconscious.`
`I wasn't sure how many seconds passed as I stared in complete bafflement.`
`...I came back to my senses and promptly shut off the boiler.`
`Then... I dragged Satoko's small body out of the bathtub.`
`The water in it... was as hot as the water in public baths.`
`...Was she in this boiling water... for the entire night...?!`
` She'll die... she'll die...!!`
`Satoko's body was lighter than I'd expected as I laid her on the floor and wrapped her in a towel.`
`I went back into the bathroom and opened up the vent, creating a path for a cool breeze to come through.`
`...Upon the breeze hitting her... Satoko moaned again...`
`"It'll be all right, Satoko!!`
` It's me, Keiichi!`
` Do you understand?!`
` Can you hear me?!"`
`"......Ke...ichi......sa...... hee...... heh..."`
`Satoko recognized me and muttered a response, but...`
`I couldn't really tell what she was saying.`
`Her eyes were muddy and unfocused—I could tell she wasn't completely conscious.`
`...Upon closer inspection... her limbs and waist were twitching slightly.`
`...This was... way worse than normal overheating...`
`This was dangerous—didn't they call this heatstroke...?!`
`...Think... What would the teacher do... if a girl passed out in the middle of summer... during a marathon in gym class or something...?!`
`I turned the water faucet in the kitchen all the way on and soaked a towel in it.`
`...I then took the cold towel and pressed it to Satoko's forehead.`
`...Satoko reacted harshly to the coldness and let out a muffled voice.`
`For burns... right, you would soak the burned spot under running water...`
`Then... could I run cold water in the shower and cool her off like that?!`
`...No... If it was that sudden... it wouldn't be good for her heart, and she'd go into shock... I think I read that once before...`
`...Agh... ah...... This... was about as much nursing as I could possibly give her.`
`...Anything more than this... would be too much... for the likes of an amateur...!!`
` "......What happened, Satoko...?`
` You're all right now.`
` ...I will... your Nii-nii will save you for sure..."`
`".........five thousand thirty-nine...`
` ...five th—*cough*! ...forty... hah...... hah......!"`
`...?`
`What was Satoko... reciting under her breath?`
` I brought my ear to her mouth to better make out the mysterious, spell-like words she kept saying.`
`...And at that moment... I understood what they were for...!`
`"Satoko... you... you're counting?!`
` ...Why...?!"`
`...People tell little kids... in the bath... to count to a hundred a lot... right...?`
`...Satoko... was counting like that.`
`...But... five thousand thirty-nine?!!`
`"You... you moron!!`
` How... how long were you supposed to count in your own bathtub?!"`
`"............Ten... tho..."`
`...I doubted my ears... and doubted her common sense.`
`...T-Ten thousand?!`
`"You're a freaking idiot!!`
` What kind of dumbass can count to ten thousand?!`
` There's no way you could do that!!`
` You'd boil to death before you got that far!!`
` Why were you...?!?"`
`".........My... uncle..."`
`Last night... her uncle flew into a rage at the dinner she'd made, saying it stunk and was inedible.`
`Satoko didn't understand what on earth he meant.`
`It wasn't much different than what she usually made for him.`
`...Maybe he hated the smell of the pickled vegetables she'd bought in particular...`
`Her uncle then decided the stink was originating from Satoko, and shouted at her that she never, ever took baths.`
`And then... he put Satoko in the boiling water and told her not to come out until she counted to...`
`"Ughoooohhhhhhhhhh!!!`
` I'll kiiill yoooooouuuuuuuuu!!!`
` Guoahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"`
`I snapped and exploded.`
`Raising the newspaper-wrapped hatchet, I stampeded through the house.`
`...I searched for anything—traces, signs, smells, vibrations, heartbeats.`
`With a war cry, I raced up the stairs with such force I could have stomped a hole through them.`
`...Then I found the futon in the room I thought to be her uncle's... and well-aware he wasn't sleeping in it... I bashed it with the hatchet.`
`Did he run into the closet?!`
`I'll bust the entire closet down, door and all!!`
`And if he's not there... maybe there's a secret door!!`
` Any switches or levers in the walls here?!`
`I smashed into wall after wall with the hatchet, crushing them.`
`...Dust rose into the air, and broken pieces scattered about the floor.`
`I smashed all the glass windows, too, for good measure.`
`"Woooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! ...Hah... hah... hah...!`
` ............Hah..."`
`After I'd destroyed everything beyond recognition in her uncle's room... my reason finally kicked in and suppressed my emotions.`
`Anyway... her uncle wasn't in the house right now.`
`...I'd have to leave killing him until later...`
` Right now... I had to do something about Satoko...!!`
`I went back to the changing room.`
`...Satoko was still lying limp on the floor.`
`...There was nothing more an amateur like me could do for her.`
` ...I needed... to take her to the clinic.`
`...Coach... had treated me like a lunatic yesterday, and tried to lock me up in a mental hospital.`
`...I never wanted to see his damn face again...`
` but I still... needed to go to the infirmary one more time.`
`...I needed to have a doctor look at Satoko...`
`I thought about putting her in the dirty uniform lying in the laundry basket... but I had no experience dressing someone, so it would be pretty difficult.`
`...Shit... I don't have time to be wasting here...!`
`I eventually gave up on clothing her and decided to carry her in her bath towel.`
`The clinic was close to Satoko's house.`
`It would be way faster to carry her there than to call 119 and get an ambulance.`
`I threw the biggest towel I could find over her and prompted her to stand.`
`"...Can you stand...?`
` I'll carry you over to the clinic."`
`"..................Thank... thank you..."`
`Her words sounded clearer than before.`
`...She was starting to come back.`
`I cried tears of relief just knowing she'd improved even a little bit.`
`Satoko turned over so she was lying on her face... and then... put up a weak struggle to get up on a knee.`
`I smoothly swept her up and put her on my back.`
` ...The towel I put on her seemed like it was about to fall off.`
`"...The towel... it hurts..."`
`"We'll be there soon... it won't be long, so stay strong...!"`
`It didn't hurt one bit to carry Satoko—she was light, too light.`
` ...The lightness... actually made me uneasy.`
`Outside, it had gotten hotter, as though eager to attack Satoko...`
`Fucking cicadas... Why did it have to choose this morning to get so hot out...`
`I didn't have time to swear at them.`
` ...The clinic... was this way.`
`Hoisting Satoko on my back, I broke into a trot...`
