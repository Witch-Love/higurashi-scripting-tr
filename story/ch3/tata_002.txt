`"Okay!`
` Anyway!!`
` Lunchtime has finally arrived!!"`
`Mion gleefully announced the beginning of lunch.`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!`
` Lunchtime at last~!`
` Someone here will have to play the punishment game, yes?"`
`"Hau...`
` The punishment this time... it's a little scary, so...`
` Sorry, but Rena went all out on making her bento...!"`
`In Rena's case, I don't think she'd lose even if she wasn't taking it seriously...`
`"...Meep.`
` We tried our hardest too."`
`"Satoko and Rika-chan made separate lunches today?`
` Usually you have the same bento, but that won't do for the showdown today, will it?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's quite all right.`
` Rika and I made sure to make separate ones."`
`"Wow, Satoko-chan and Rika-chan both tried really hard!`
` How exciting!"`
`"...What's a little surprising is that Kei-chan was able to make a bento!`
` Good job, Kei-chan!`
` It looks like you really can do it if you try!"`
`I scratched my head and gave her a dry smile.`
`...My bento today had been made entirely by Satoko last night.`
`It had none of my personality.`
` So there wasn't anything there that they could praise me for.`
`"What does Keiichi-kun's bento look like?`
` Hau, I can't wait to see!"`
`"Don't expect too much...`
` It's just the leftover rice and side dishes from last night..."`
`"...Leftovers are the foundation of bentos."`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!`
` Now we'll know your dinner last night too—we'll kill two birds with one stone!"`
`...Was it really better to hide the fact that Satoko came over and made dinner last night...?`
`Well, of course it was.`
`...If I revealed that I didn't make my own bento, I'd be sure to end up playing the punishment game.`
`Today's punishment game... was to stand right in front of the curry maniac Chie-sensei and say bad things about curry!`
`It wasn't too different from telling someone to jump out of a hundredth-story window.`
`...It was exactly the same as telling someone to die...!`
`"But Mii-chan...`
` How will we decide who wins and loses the bento showdown?`
` Keiichi-kun made his own too, so maybe we should call it a draw for today?"`
`"...We could do that.`
` The punishment game yesterday was sort of a whip to encourage Keiichi-san to cook for himself, after all."`
`"...And Keiichi made his own too, so it's a draw."`
`My simple bento with last night's leftovers could never have stood up to everyone else's bento that they made to win...`
`I fully understood Satoko and Rika-chan's concern for me as they tried to end the showdown peaceably.`
`...However!`
` The club president, Mion Sonozaki, would not be convinced by something like that...!!`
`"I wonder why you're all so optimistic!`
` Leaving one of our showdowns in such a grey area is out of the question!! `
`"I-I knew you'd say that...`
` There's no way you'd end it that way, with your battle lust..."`
`This was bad...`
`...At this rate... I was sure to be the sole loser.`
`...But, well... I didn't make this bento, after all...`
`...Maybe... I need to resign myself to my inevitable loss...`
`"...Okay, Mii.`
` How are we going to decide who wins?"`
`"It won't be fair if we grade each other's.`
` Let's do an open judgment!`
` Okay, everyone!!`
` Assemble~!!"`
`Mion commanded everyone, who had just started eating, using her club president voice.`
`"Come and judge our five bento!!`
` Write your favorite three on a piece of paper and submit it!`
` Understand?!"`
`Everyone in the class was used to being dragged into Mion's club activities.`
` Yeeaah!`
` came the energetic voices from here and there.`
`...Everyone already knew that the showdown this time involved an utterly fatal punishment game...`
` and they were all very interested in what would happen to whoever lost.`
`...Of course, they wanted the thrill of seeing something terrifying!`
`"Okay... Everyone ready?!`
` Then I'll go first, all right?!`
` Ta-daah!!"`
`In exaggerated fashion, Mion pulled the lid off her multi-tiered, ornate bento box.`
`Multiple cheers of joy erupted at the brilliant sight...!!`
`"T-That's amazing!!`
` It's just like New Year's food!"`
`"It can't be...`
` It has to be a lie.`
` She must have switched the contents with a catered bento.`
` Such purely Japanese cooking...!`
` Mion!!`
` Mion Sonozaki couldn't possibly make this!!!"`
`"Nope... This is easy for Mii-chan if she gets serious...`
` She almost never gets serious though..."`
`"Ku-ku-ku...!`
` Just who do you think this old man is?`
` Given enough time and ingredients, I could even reproduce the Manchu Han Imperial Feast! Ku-ku-ku!"`
`The entire classroom gulped audibly.`
`...And everyone wrote down a score on the notepaper in their hands simultaneously.`
`It made sense.`
` Just the visual impact would give her a perfect score...!`
`"All right, let's see Rena's next!`
` Rena's really good at cooking too!"`
`"...Rena's bento is always like a flower arrangement."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Thanks, everyone!`
` I'll reveal my bento now.`
` Eeii~☆."`
`Rena's bento...`
` was a beautiful mix of the two colors of eggs and minced meat... and it, too, was a bento staple,`
` the soboro bento!`
`She had been thorough with the side dishes as well, and they were abundant in number.`
`...She had spent more time than usual on it, but it was unassuming and truly nonchalant.`
`One couldn't ignore the household warmth in it that Mion's bento lacked.`
`"...If I may say... you've done it again!`
` This... should get quite a high score!"`
`"...I should have known.`
` It may look rigid, but there isn't anything to deduct points from.`
` ...Amazing as always!"`
`Once again, every one of the judges wrote a score on their note paper at the same time.`
`There seemed to be some who were revising their opinions when they compared it to Mion's score, too.`
`...The whole classroom seemed split between Mion and Rena.`
`And on everyone's face, it was clear...`
` that they all wanted to be tasting them, rather than scoring them!`
`"...Then we'll be next."`
`"Yes!`
` I will now reveal mine!!"`
`Come to think of it...`
`Satoko and Rika-chan ate with me last night at my house...`
`It was impressive that they still made a bento...`
`Both their bentos... were clearly lacking compared to Mion's artfulness and Rena's perfection.`
`...However... because of that, you could sense from them how hard they worked.`
`The toppings were a little on the rough side... but you could still feel... that they tried their hardest.`
` It made you feel a little biased, so that you'd give them more points.`
`A few people struck by just that once again revised their opinions and wrote in scores on their note paper.`
`"...Satoko, Rika-chan...`
` You both made really good bentos today...`
` They might not measure up to Rena or Mion's craftsmanship... But when you think about that, they're pretty amazing..."`
`Satoko and Rika-chan glanced at each other and grinned happily.`
`"This... is a secret, okay...?`
` Mutter mutter."`
`......Eh.`
` ......What?!`
`When Satoko told me, I broke off from the others... and secretly looked for my classmates' bento boxes.`
`...There—Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun's bento boxes!`
`I took a quick peek inside, and...`
`Ahhh!!`
`Half of the contents were missing!!!`
` N-Not bad!!`
`In the end, Satoko and Rika-chan hadn't made bento today...`
` A bold move—they got Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun to share their bentos with them!!`
`"...Hey, Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun...`
` How did they buy you out?"`
`"W-W-W-W-W-W-What are you saying, Maebara-san?!`
` W-W-W-W-W-When did we get bought out, and for what?!"`
`"T-T-T-That's right...!`
` It's not like we traded them our duty watering the garden for half our bentos...!!"`
`...Curse you, Satoko.`
`What an impudent trick...!`
`Satoko grinned, showing her fang-like canines, and laughed in triumph.`
`"Oh, this is only something I learned from you, Keiichi-san!`
` Oh-ho-ho-ho!"`
`"...Yes, oh-ho-ho."`
`Heh, how naive—buying them out with watering duty alone.`
`They're men—if you're going to buy them out, you need to use something a lot spicier than that!!`
`For example... hmm.`
` ...Like giving them three tickets to walk Satoko and Rika-chan around like dogs all day, with them on all fours, wearing tails, and with leashes around their necks. `
`...Whoaaaa, t-that would... That might be enough to get me to do anything?!?!`
`...As I was lost in my wild fantasies, Mion clapped me on the shoulder and called me back to reality.`
`(Damn, it was just getting good...!)`
`"All right!!`
` Next up is Kei-chan's bento!!`
` We're all hoping for something pretty great because of your declaration yesterday... but how did it really turn out?!"`
`"Keiichi-kun can do it if he needs to!`
` Rena was really excited for today. Today!"`
`...Urgh, they're all looking forward to it...`
`But... it's really just leftovers from dinner last night.`
`I didn't even make it, either.`
`...How was that supposed to stand up to Mion and Rena and the others...?`
`"Argh, that's it!!`
` Feast your eyes on this!!`
` Haahhh!!"`
`I tore the lid off my bento box.`
`...There weren't very many cheers.`
` ...Well, I guess there wouldn't be...`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Keiichi-kun, you tried your hardest too!`
` Rena can tell how hard you worked."`
`"Rena...`
` Don't feel like you need to compliment me..."`
`"Umm... How did this happen?`
` Was Keiichi-san actually a hard worker after all...?"`
`"Ku-ku-ku-ku!`
` Well, I mean... I want to acknowledge how hard you tried, but...`
` For this showdown, it doesn't matter.`
` Ku-ku-ku-ku!"`
`Mion's cold, mean laugh...!`
` It was like it spoke for everyone's opinion, just like that.`
`"Um... Hmm...`
` Keiichi-kun did really well considering it was his first challenge, you know?`
` I think maybe everyone should rate his a little higher..."`
`"...But for the showdown, it doesn't matter."`
`"Ku-ku-ku-ku...`
` All right, Kei-chan.`
` If you have any last words before we tally up the results, I'll listen to them now.`
` Ku-ku-ku!"`
`"W...What do you mean by last words?"`
`"I mean that you might be hoping for a few extra points if you appeal somehow to the crowd.`
` ...Ku-ku-ku!`
`After all, for today's showdown, you just need to avoid coming in last.`
` If you do well enough... then maybe you'll be able to worm out of the punishment game."`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!`
` You are implying that Keiichi-san's bento is going to take last place, aren't you?"`
`"No, this old man wasn't trying to say anyone's bento came in last or anything.`
` Ku-ku-ku!"`
`Mion cackled repulsively.`
`...In contrast, Satoko's smile was growing somehow awkward.`
`...Oh, right.`
`This bento was filled with last night's side dishes.`
` ...That means it was basically a bento that Satoko made.`
`And Mion outright said it would come in last place...`
`"Mii-chan, aren't you being a little mean?`
` Poor Keiichi-kun."`
`"Rena...`
` Kei-chan knew he couldn't lose today's bento showdown beforehand, didn't he?`
` He did all that grandstanding yesterday, well aware of that. `
`I don't think there's any reason to go easy on him, do you?`
` Right, Satoko?"`
`"Y... Yes!`
` You are right!`
` And he came here with this mess—it makes me laugh!`
` Ohh-ho-ho-ho!"`
`"...Wait, Satoko-chan!`
` You can't laugh at him."`
`"But that bento is just so ridiculous I can't help but laugh!`
` These side dishes look like they were bought from a shop—it's really disillusioning!"`
`"Look, this one was just taken out of a can, wasn't it?`
` This cucumber here isn't cut cleanly, like the knife didn't go all the way through~ `
`Kei-chan, you never used a knife, did you?`
` Your lack of experience is apparent."`
`"...Nooo, this goes beyond a simple lack of experience!"`
`"The presentation is fairly monotonous as well.`
` It's almost a shock to see such a lack of taste!`
` Ah-ha-ha-ha!"`
`"Urk... I-It was my first experience putting food into a bento box, so...`
` Of course it's not going to look too good..."`
`"Kei-chan, Kei-chan.`
` There's a bigger problem than how you put it into the box!`
` Tomita, Okamura.`
` Explain please~"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were chosen from our many underclassmen.`
`Tomita-kun quickly adjusted his glasses and took a step forward.`
` As you know, there are three primary colors forming the basis of all colors. `
`So if you want a well-balanced color scheme, then excluding white and black, you need those three colors."`
`"And, nevertheless.`
` If you removed the white and black from Maebara-san's bento, all that would be left is dark green."`
`Ah, dark green...`
`No one will want to eat it if you describe it like that...`
`...I had forgotten.`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun had been bought out by Rika-chan and Satoko, so they were trying their hardest to let them win and make me lose, weren't they?`
`...Gah, what strong wills they have.`
`It was charming if only because they were working so hard despite having been bought out.`
`"The side dishes have no spirit in them either—they're all prepackaged or canned food."`
`"In other words, out of the three necessary requirements for a bento:`
` love,`
` spirit,`
` and taste, we can assert that Maebara-san's bento is lacking two of these!!"`
`The classroom, convinced by the elucidation of the mystery they were thoroughly baffled with, raised mysterious groans of admiration.`
`"...Ku-ku-ku!`
` No heart, and no spirit.`
` It's decided, then?`
` Keiichi Maebara!!"`
`"Hmm...`
` This may sound cold... But if you realized how much fun cooking is because of all this, Keiichi-kun... isn't that enough? Enough?"`
`"...In any case, everything is fine as long as I'm not doing the punishment game."`
`Rena was giving a dry, "ehehe♪" smile as well.`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!!`
` It's been settled, Keiichi-san!`
` You're going to be the one doing the punishment game!!`
` Ohh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!"`
`She laughed in such a vile manner... but she didn't look like she meant it.`
`I knew that Satoko was speaking ill of a bento that she'd practically made herself in front of the whole classroom, and I could tell how painful that laughter was.`
`......Okamura-kun said before that this bento lacked spirit.`
`...But among all the bento laid out here today, there wasn't a single one with as much spirit as this one.`
`This meal... that she made for me yesterday in such a good mood (though it looked like she was in a bad one)... I won't let it end with this slander...!`
`"Well then!`
` Last place, Keiichi-san?!`
` Please, admit your honest defeat already!!"`
`"...Could you wait just a moment?"`
`When I began to speak in a low voice, the expressions of all the members of the club changed.`
`Mion clicked her tongue.`
`...This man was bearing his fangs at the last moment again...!`
`"My bento was defeated because it lacked spirit.`
` That's how you explained it.`
` Am I wrong, Okamura-kun?"`
`Okamura-kun, who had suddenly been placed in the spotlight, looked flustered for a moment, but immediately, he stammered in reply that I was right.`
`"How do you measure spirit?`
` By difficulty?`
` By effort?`
` By sweat, or tears?`
` By its manifestation?!`
` ...Then how would you rate these burns that are still on my hands?!?!"`
`"Wow... Keiichi-kun, those... Those are oil burns...?!"`
`Great—the burn marks from when I almost caused a fire yesterday looked just like I was having a ton of trouble cooking.`
`I could clearly tell that the classroom was forced to acknowledge the effort I put into it!`
`"...I see.`
` ...To turn your failures at cooking due to lack of skill into scars of hard work instead...`
` As I thought...`
` I cannot falter around this man!"`
`"That's right.`
` I lack skill.`
` I'm so bad at cooking that my grandstanding yesterday was pitiful.`
` But I didn't run away!`
` I fought!!`
` And I delivered these results!!`
` Is that not spirit?!`
` What do you think?!?!"`
`"Rena wants to acknowledge it...!`
` Nobody can keep on going... if their defiant spirit doesn't get valued!"`
`The girls in the class started to nod in agreement.`
`...Okay!`
` The tables are turning!!`
`But Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun, bought out by the objects of their unrequited affection, weren't about to lose either.`
`They shifted to the counterattack, clearly exceeding the price they were paid!!`
`"I see!`
` I understand your feelings, Maebara-san!`
` However, if spirit was all that mattered in cooking, the world wouldn't need chefs!"`
`"That's right.`
` If a chef brought you burned steak and said they put their spirit into it and tried hard, would you pay them?`
` You wouldn't, would you?!`
` It's the same thing!"`
`That's right, that's how it goes!`
`The male students took Tomita and Okamura's side.`
`...Gah, they did have a point.`
`"What about consideration?!`
` Even if you did get a totally black steak!!`
` If I knew how much the mother who made it struggled, I would eat it!`
` I would eat it all!!"`
`Clap clap clap clap!!`
`This time, the female students in the class took my side.`
` ...Good!`
` Now we're even!!`
`"Besides, a bento is a refinement of one's love given form!!"`
`"It only means something when the other person feels that way.`
` Does your bento make us feel that way, Maebara-san?!`
` No, it doesn't make me feel that way!"`
`"""You're meeeeaaaan!!!"""`
`The girls in the class began to boo loudly at his remark!`
` Now even Okamura-san was panicking.`
`"Uhh, order, order!`
` Will the spectators please refrain from making remarks!"`
`"Your Honor!`
` In order to prove how much of my spirit has gone into this bento, I call Ms. Ryuugu Rena, an authority in the culinary arts, to the stand!"`
`"U-Umm...!`
` R-Rena thinks this bento has spirit in it!`
` It might be rather artless in places...`
` But I think cooking isn't just about outward appearances!"`
`The girls in the class again gave cries of support as they all applauded!`
`In response, all the men in the class began to boo!!`
`"Y-Your Honor!`
` The opinions of Maebara-san and Ryuugu-san are extremely sentimental, and aren't in following with common sense.`
` They are unsuitable to use as evidence!!"`
`"Order, order!!`
` The prosecution's objection is sustained.`
` Go ahead!"`
`"Ahem.`
` Let's replace the bento in question with a birthday present, for example.`
`Let's say on my birthday, I, Tomita, received a hand-knitted sweater.`
` And he, Okamura, received a bookstore gift certificate for 10,000 yen!"`
`...That felt strangely real.`
` Was it actually just an example?`
`"Common sense dictates which of them has the spirit.`
` It is, of course, the hand-knitted sweater!`
` If we went back to the bento, this would be handmade side dishes!`
`And the gift certificate, which is nothing more than money, allows you to buy things—in other words, it's the same as simple, meaningless canned goods!!"`
`Murmur murmur murmur murmur!!`
`The boys and girls all began to argue amongst themselves about presents.`
`They were all talking about what they received as presents in the past...!`
`Damn...!`
`Tomita-kun... He changed the subject to something that could easily grab everyone's attention... Not bad!!`
`I'll lose the initiative at this rate!!`
`"Objection!!`
` This matter regards the spirit put into the bento!`
` It is entirely different from birthday presents, as they are each unique situations!"`
`"Overruled.`
` Will the prosecution please continue?"`
`D-Damn!!`
`"Now then.`
` What's important here is the fact that the spirit of the giver and spirit of the receiver are totally different.`
`Between the handmade sweater that looks a little bit askew and the 10,000 yen book store gift certificate placed here before your very eyes, which would you say is the better choice?!`
`The gift certificate, right?!`
` It's 10,000 yen! 10,000!!`
` Can you calculate how many comic books you could buy with that?! `
`You could instantly complete a full collection if it was around 10 volumes long!!`
` The bliss of your soothed heart can't be compared to the sweater!"`
`The boys unanimously praised that with applause.`
`...Materialistic brats...`
` ...Mgh... But all guys that age are like that.`
`Even I would choose the gift certificate over the sweater in that case...!`
`Hey, wait, weren't you guys the ones who said it was about love, spirit, and taste right at the start?!`
`Since when did taste trump all?! That's the stance they were taking now!!`
`"I believe this has demonstrated that the spirit of the giver and the spirit of the receiver have no causal relationship. `
`...Yes!!`
` No matter how much Maebara-san struggled to make this bento!`
` That cannot enter into consideration for the rest of us on the receiving end!!"`
`"M-Mere sophistry, Tomita-kun!!`
` It has plenty of spirit!`
` Whether that gets through or not is the receiver's problem!!"`
`"""That's right!!"""`
`"""Boooo!!!"""`
`"""Taste is most important!!"""`
` """Enemy of women!!"""`
`Ah, now the courtroom is in chaos...!!`
` But I can't allow myself to lose!!`
`And not only to avoid the punishment game.`
`But also... to protect Satoko's honor!!`
`"Now then.`
` Do the defendants have a response to give?"`
`Slowly and strongly... I nod, and step up to the dais.`
`Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun.`
`...Do you two...`
` really think you can beat me with mere words...?!?!`
`"The prosecution just said that we should value the gift without basing it on the spirit of the giver.`
` Correct?!"`
`...At some point I began speaking formally...`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` No matter how much you labored to make that bento, that labor should not factor into our grading!"`
`"Then I have a question for the prosecution.`
` If I, Maebara, were to take the bento I made for today and placed it beside one bought from the store...`
` Would both of these be given the same score...?!"`
`The prosecution hesitated to speak.`
` ...Got you!!!`
`"That's right!!`
` A convenience store bento doesn't even come close to a homemade one!`
`No matter how badly made it is, it has far more spirit than a bento that you just bought would ever have!!`
` You see, that spirit <i>is</i> being graded!! `
`Meaning, the spirit the cook put into the bento has already reached the recipients!!`
` Admit it!!!"`
`Booooommmm!!`
`With those impactful words drawn in the air behind me, I pointed my finger!!`
`The girls, led by Rena, broke into applause!!`
`Some of the boys were admitting it, too!`
`"...Mgghhhh!!`
` I-I'll admit it..."`
`"You admitted it?!`
` You admitted it, right?!`
` Then let's move to why a convenience store bento has no spirit in it.`
` What exactly <i>is</i> the spirit in a bento in the first place?!"`
`"O-Objection!`
` Maebara-san is trying to deceive the court by using abstract expressions!"`
`"Objection overruled.`
` This sounds interesting, so listen until he's done."`
`Got them.`
`...Now I'll show you two the difference between us!!`
`"Your Honor.`
` I'd like to call Ms. Rika Furude to the stand as a witness!"`
`"...Meep."`
`Even for Rika-chan, that must have seemed like a bolt from the blue.`
`There's no doubt that she never dreamed the point of my spear would be aiming at her.`
`...But Rika-chan...`
` You said it before!`
` For this showdown... it doesn't matter!!!`
`"Rika Furude-san.`
` Your bento today was very well made.`
` It looks delicious."`
`"...Meep?"`
`Yes.`
`Satoko and Rika-chan's bentos had been made of half of Tomita-kun's and Okamura-kun's.`
`The prosecutors' faces turned pale... but they were too late!!`
`"Rena.`
` Would you bring Okamura-kun's bento over here?"`
`"Huh?`
` Okay, sure!"`
`"Y-Your Honor!`
` My bento has no relevance to this case!!"`
`"Overruled.`
` ...Ku-ku-ku!"`
`"Your Honor, I submit Okamura-kun's bento box as evidence!`
` Look at it!!`
` Look at what's inside!!!"`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Ku-ku-ku, there's only half in there...!"`
`"It's not about whether there's half—please, look a little more closely!!`
` See?!?"`
`""""Ahhh?!?! They're exactly the same!!!""""`
`"Your Honor, you've seen it!`
` Miss Rika Furude's bento is stolen from Okamura-kun's!`
` There is no way such a thing could have spirit in it!!!!"`
`"N-No, but that's... just a coincidence...!!"`
`"It's already obvious!`
` Spirit—it's a game of catch between the giver and the receiver!!`
` The bento box, then, is the ball!`
` That bento was something Okamura-kun was given—from mother to son! `
`That means Okamura-kun is the only one who can feel the spirit from this bento box!!`
` Now that it's been disturbed and been stolen... it no longer has that spirit!!!"`
`Dun-dun-duuuuuunnnn!!!`
` Yaaaay... That did it!!`
`"Huh?`
` What?`
` I-Is that true?!`
` Rika-chan, is that true...?!"`
`"...Meep.`
` Nipah~♪"`
`"Ku-ku-ku-ku.`
` ...I see how it is."`
`Mion, the judge, folded her arms and began to hum...`
`...I couldn't even take a guess... as to what Mion was laughing about.`
`Frankly, I didn't know... whether I would win or lose...!!`
`"Okay.`
` ...Before announcing my judgement, I'll start from the top."`
`Shh...`
` The entire classroom quieted...`
`"First.`
` ...From an objective standpoint, there is no doubt that the bento of the accused, Keiichi Maebara, must be seen as poorly-made.`
` This is something that the grading results clearly display!"`
`...Gah!`
`"But as Kei-chan said, cooking is not all about taste.`
` The spirit put into it should be considered subtle seasoning. `
`For grading, though, that would only amount to a few points.`
` It's so subtle that it's not enough to alter the results."`
`...Grrr!`
`"Now then.`
` I'd like to mention the original reason for today's bento showdown.`
` What was the reason for it?`
`That's right.`
` We started it to see whether the accused, Keiichi Maebara, could cook for himself, and to measure the result!"`
`"Yeah.`
` That's right!`
` Keiichi-kun did make his own bento!"`
`...Urk.`
` That stung my conscience a bit... but for the showdown, it didn't matter.`
`"So, the whole basis behind this showdown was to cook a meal for yourself!`
` In other words, whether or not the meal was homemade!!`
`Rika-chan neglecting to do that... is a much bigger problem than how good her bento is!`
` In other words... is she disqualified!?!?"`
`"...Nipah~♪."`
`Rika-chan let out a nipah~, looking as though she had prepared herself for this outcome.`
`"D-Don't take it personally, Rika-chan.`
` At our club, things like that don't matter."`
`"...Keiichi did well, like I thought.`
` You tried your hardest until the very end."`
`Rika-chan demanded I lower my head, then she pet it.`
`"With that over with, this case is closed!!!`
` Today, last place goes to...`
` Rika Furudeeee!!!"`
`""""Woooooooooaaaahhh...!!!""""`
`That miraculous turnaround!!!`
`And... last place went to... Rika-chan, the one everyone had least expected!!`
`The whole classroom went wild!!!!`
`"...H-Hmph.`
` I'm amazed you managed to avoid coming in last place with such a terrible bento."`
`Satoko looked at me hatefully, but spoke in a vague kind of voice.`
`"There's no way I'd come in last.`
` There's nothing in this bento that would deserve last place!"`
`Grab!!`
`Satoko was speaking more and more poorly of herself as time went on—so I roughly grabbed her head and began to stroke it.`
`"I told you!`
` Spirit is important.`
` This bento isn't all about appearance—it's got all kinds of flavors in it!"`
`"But... Spirit isn't the only thing...!!`
` It tastes... totally weird, and..."`
`"What about it is weird?!`
` I thought it was great!`
` It was absolutely great!!`
` That's why I packed it!! `
`If dinner last night had been bad, then I would never have brought it to school.`
` I would have come here with some bread and a milk carton!!"`
`"...Umm... B-But, but...!!!"`
`Oh, just shut up already.`
`I caressed her head, swinging it from side to side.`
`At some point, Rena had come up behind us.`
`She was giggling to herself.`
`...That was the face of someone who had known everything from the beginning.`
`"When did you realize I hadn't made it?"`
`"When you showed us your burns, I guess?`
` I mean, there's nothing in your bento that you needed oil for...!"`
`"...Umm, err...!`
` Rena-san, don't you think you are misunderstanding something?!`
` I-I didn't do anything...!"`
`"Huh?`
` Satoko-chan, you weren't the one who made this bento?`
` Then did Keiichi-kun make it by himself after all?`
` Okay.`
` Then I guess he did."`
`Rena smiled roguishly and turned from Satoko to me.`
`"When you cut cucumbers, you hold the knife like this, and go like this.`
` As for the colors, you can express all sorts of things if you place vegetables in the right way!"`
`...This lecture was clearly not meant for me.`
`"But you've gotten a lot better since the last time you showed us.`
` I see you've been studying!`
` If you keep this up, I bet you'll be able to make better and better dishes in no time!"`
`She continued saying words clearly meant for Satoko while facing me instead.`
`...Satoko was wearing an ambiguous look, and couldn't even nod her head at her.`
`"Anyway, no matter what anyone says!`
` I like the way my bento is today.`
` I'm not gonna share it with anyone else, either!`
` I'll eat the whole thing by myself!!"`
`"Wow, how greedy...!`
` Rena wants to try some too! Too!"`
`As we were going back and forth, Satoko rubbed her eyes as though she was drowsy, then announced to Mion, and everyone else:`
`"E-Excuse me... The truth is...!`
` ...I got Tomita-san to give me some of his bento!"`
`"Stupid!`
` ...Houjou, what are you saying...?!"`
`If she'd kept it a secret, then at least she would have been saved...`
` Tomita-kun looked at her with an expression filled with regret and surprise.`
`"Huh?`
` Is that true?!`
` Really?!`
` Oh my...☆"`
`Mion spun her finger around, then pointed to the hallway, sentencing Satoko to the punishment game as well.`
`Satoko left the classroom behind her, completely prepared, as though she was going with Rika-chan on an errand.`
`"...I can't let Rika go alone.`
` I will accompany her to the very depths of hell."`
`"...You don't need to go that far."`
`"My word, Keiichi-san really is terrible, too!`
` Humiliating only Rika like that—he is truly a rotten person!"`
`I didn't mean...`
`I couldn't just return Satoko's kindness with malice...`
`"...Hey?`
` Satoko really is silly."`
`Rika-chan spoke so that only I could hear, grinning happily.`
`"Now then!`
` Let us be off, Rika!`
` Punishment games are one of our duties as club members!!"`
`Satoko seemed awfully happy—not frustrated in the slightest, like she always was when she lost.`
`...Damn.`
`...Rika-chan's right after all.`
` Everyone here is a moron!`
`"Mion!`
` I'll come clean too!!`
` I didn't make my bento today!`
` I was the same!`
` So I'm going with them!`
` For the punishment game!!"`
`"Huh!?`
` Even you, Kei-chan!?`
` W-What's going on...!?"`
`"Uhuhuhu!`
` Good luck!`
` With the punishment game, I mean!`
` I'll get the first aid kit ready."`
`"...Call an ambulance in advance, will you?`
` And maybe a hearse, just in case..."`
`Leaving a bewildered Mion and a happily-smiling Rena behind in the classroom, I went into the hallway.`
`"...Wh-What are you doing?!`
` You finally won for once!`
` I had no idea you had such an odd taste for these punishment games that you'd go so far as to volunteer yourself for one!"`
`"Guess so.`
` It's a little much for a hobby, eh?"`
`"...I swear!`
` I think you're underestimating this one!`
` We're one thing, but grave harm might actually befall you, Keiichi-san!`
` I hope you're ready to have one or two ribs broken!"`
`"Urgh... That sounds like it would hurt... I don't like getting hurt..."`
`"Keiichi-san, you just stand there and nod along, okay?!`
` Rika and I will smooth it over!`
` I swear!`
` I can't believe I have to look after you even during a punishment game... Seriously!"`
`...I already knew that her pouty behavior was a sign that she was actually in a really good mood.`
`So it made me want to smile.`
`"Hey.`
` I do want to eat some vegetable stir-fry... Satoko, can you make that?"`
`"What...?!`
` Err... Well, there's nothing I can't do if I put my mind to it!"`
`"...She can make it very well.`
` I really like Satoko's stir-fry."`
`She was uneasy at first, but once she got assurance from Rika-chan, she turned back and looked at me with once-more confident eyes.`
`"It's settled, then.`
` Let's go shopping for stuff after school today.`
` I don't really have any idea what to buy, after all."`
`"That is true, isn't it?`
` I think it's still too early for you to go shopping at the supermarket, Keiichi-san!`
` It would make me anxious if I wasn't watching!"`
`"...And Satoko makes me anxious that she'll buy the wrong thing if I'm not watching."`
`"R-Rikaaa!!"`
`"Meep~~!!"`
`The conversation continued as we walked, until we arrived before the door to the teacher's lounge.`
`"Okay!`
` Let's get this punishment game over with and discuss the menu for tonight!"`
`"...Meep☆."`
`Rika-chan gleefully grabbed onto my arm.`
` In turn, I pulled Satoko to me, grabbing her shoulder with my other hand.`
`"We'll all be together in death!`
` I won't let anyone die alone!"`
`"...We're all together.`
` I won't let anybody die alone."`
`"W-What an indiscreet thing to say!`
` I want no part in something so disturbing!!"`
`She may have sounded annoyed...`
` but she was so happy it was gonna make ME blush.`
`"All right.`
` Just beyond this door is the world after death!`
` However, we shall return!`
` All of us will!!"`
`"Yes!!`
` Everyone will!!`
` Then... let us sally forth!!"`
`Slaaaam!!!`
`We opened the doorway to the world of death!!`
`And like she did every day, just as the sun rose in the eastern sky...`
`Chie-sensei was eating curry for lunch.`
`It was store-bought, but she made a point of eating a different brand every day.`
`"Oh, my.`
` Maebara-kun, Furude-san, and Houjou-san.`
` ...Is something the matter?"`
`She appeared to be in the middle of a moment of supreme bliss, her mouth full of her beloved curry.`
`...And we were to pick a fight with her—what a crime this punishment game would be!`
`However, it was what we had to do!`
`For that... was the rule of our club!!`
`The three of us held each other's shoulders tightly once more.`
`"...All right, let's do this.`
` Ready?"`
`"What do you mean, ready!?`
` Keiichi-san, you're going to stay quiet!!`
` Rika and I will handle everything!!`
` Entrust your life to me for now!"`
`"...Go for it, yay."`
`"...What are you all doing?`
` ...???"`
`We could see two or three question marks popping up above the teacher's head.`
`All right, Satoko.`
`This is the only time I'll trust you with my life.`
` ...Because I'll be shutting my eyes tightly and only thinking about what we'll be having for dinner...!!`
` I'm leaving it to you...!!!`
`Satoko inhaled deeply.`
` ...And so...`
`"H-Hey, you over there!`
` You stuck up curry snob, you're single because you smell like garlic!"`
`In the end...`
` My selfish request was readily granted.`
`As Satoko muttered complaints under her breath (quite merrily), she came with me to the store.`
`Rika-chan didn't come with us.`
`She said she had a thing she wanted to do, or something.`
`I believed her when she told me, but when I really thought about it... I started to think maybe she was being considerate towards Satoko in her own way.`
`Without Rika-chan here, Satoko was prouder and more loquacious than ever.`
`"Do you understand?`
` Supermarkets will put things on sale when it gets near closing time!`
` For example, you can't have a stir-fry without some pork—and if we wait a little longer it'll be marked half off! `
`They can't sell meat or fish once it's not fresh anymore...`
` So they make it all cheaper in a last ditch effort not to have anything left over! `
`Of course, every veteran housewife is familiar with this concept, and when we get close to happy hour like we are now..."`
`...and I wasn't really listening to her, but she was telling me all this quite proudly.`
`Every time I seemed surprised at something, or made an affirmative grunt in place of conversation, Satoko would say: "you don't know anything, do you, Keiichi-san!" `
`and smile very happily in spite of her complaints.`
`She led me by the hand to all sorts of stalls, one after the other.`
`...She was in such a supreme mood... that just being with her cheered me up.`
`Merely being pulled into Satoko's pace was a lot of fun.`
`"Hey, why don't we just go with this economy-size pack?`
` Whoa, there's a real good-looking one with cheese in it over here...!!"`
`"Keiichi-san, you have no financial sense!`
` Look at this!!`
` It's over our budget!`
` We don't have enough money!!"`
`Satoko pushed a handful of receipts in my face.`
`Pfft!`
` Why can't Satoko do these kinds of mental calculations when she's at school?!`
`"Drat...!`
` Should we buy a load of the normal ones, or buy fewer of the better stuff with the cheese in it...`
` This is... quite troubling!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` For boys at your age, it's wiser to choose quantity over quality!"`
`"Grr, Satoko, you're being too strict!`
` A man's heart desires both quality AND quantity—why can't you understand that?!"`
`"No matter the size of a man's heart, his wallet won't be any bigger!`
` I swear!!`
` Hey, stop clinging to the glass so stubbornly!!"`
`After enjoying ourselves in such an exchange, we started to hear energetic voices coming from over by the butcher we visited earlier.`
`I could see a handful of housewives flooding the place.`
`"O-Oh no!!`
` If we don't hurry, all the half-off pork will be gone!!"`
`"Ow, owwww...!`
` Don't pull me!`
` Don't pull on my neck!!"`
`Satoko really seemed like she was having fun.`
`...She looked like a kid who had grabbed her family's hands while running towards an amusement park attraction.`
`In the end, the bag of pork we obtained was so normal that it almost hurt, but...`
`I knew that it would taste absolutely delicious.`
`Outside, at some point the cicadas had been replaced by the higurashi's chorus.`
`...The air was so clear, and it felt so good.`
`...Our silhouettes stretching out on the ground made for a really wonderful picture.`
`We had filled our bicycle baskets to the brim with our shopping bags.`
`They only contained ingredients and various other foodstuffs.`
`Even so, every last thing packed in them sort of looked really happy, and made me feel really happy in turn.`
`"Going shopping for dinner seems pretty sensible too.`
` It makes you really enjoy your meals—I can't wait to eat."`
`"That's a part of cooking for yourself, as well.`
` Dinner starts while you're shopping for it."`
`"I'm so excited for this!`
` Vegetable stir-fry isn't even in my mom's cookbook.`
` I never get to eat it unless we go out to a Chinese place—so I'm really looking forward to it today."`
`"That is indeed a pity.`
` Then today, I will present to you an especially tasty dish."`
`Normally, right about now...`
`was the time I would start messing with her.`
` ...But I didn't.`
`"Yeah.`
` I bet you'll end up making something really great.`
` I'm really looking forward to it."`
`"......Um... uh."`
`She stammered for a second.`
`Satoko had been prepared for me to start making fun of her right then, too... and when it didn't come, she was surprised.`
`...Or maybe she stammered for some other reason—I don't know.`
`But I immediately knew she wasn't feeling anything bad.`
`"Yes!`
` I'll deliver an extraordinarily delectable dish!`
` You'd better look forward to it!"`
`As Satoko and I rode back on our bikes, I had a thought.`
`Was I this sort of person?`
`Until now, I would have lashed back at Satoko right away if she did something to me.`
`Yeah, that was the kind of relationship we had.`
`We would poke at each other a little, then kick up a storm while nitpicking at one another.`
`At some point... that had changed.`
`We weren't playing our usual tit-for-tat.`
`I didn't provoke her, so we didn't fight.`
`That went for Satoko, too.`
`Satoko, who I thought I knew, hadn't been like this until now.`
`Our relationship was changing, little by little.`
` ...That's what it felt like.`
`But... it wasn't something I had to worry about.`
` ...It was like... our relationship had become a little bit happier, a little bit more charming.`
`...I wonder why we changed like this?`
`...Was she lonely, and projecting her older brother Satoshi, who hadn't returned home, onto me?`
`Rika-chan told me about that yesterday.`
`That was probably exactly it.`
`So... as my actions drew closer to Satoshi's, Satoko was returning to how she'd been when she was living happily with her brother.`
`In other words, this Satoko was the real Satoko.`
`...Satoko had been able to see her brother again, and had finally gone back to normal.`
`Now that I'd been playing the role of her brother, I'd discovered that she really could smile so sweetly.`
`......But I wasn't Satoshi Houjou.`
`...I was Keiichi Maebara—a totally different person.`
`I couldn't become her brother.`
` I could come close, but I could never really get there.`
`That was... vaguely, somehow... a little sad.`
`I was wearing Satoshi's mantle, and that would have to come off one day.`
`And that would doubtlessly put an end to this meager, nostalgic, peaceful time of Satoko's.`
`A limited tranquility.`
`...A tranquility that would end one day.`
` ...Putting it in those terms, it really was sad.`
`I shook my head firmly and drove off those pointless thoughts.`
`"W-What's the matter, Keiichi-san...?"`
`"Sorry, it's nothing."`
`"If it's nothing, then please don't act all strange like that.`
` It makes me worried that you might have eaten something rotten!"`
`"Right, right—sorry, Satoko!"`
`Nagging like always... but she still seemed really happy.`
`That mood of hers drew me in, putting a smile on my own face.`
`Hey, Keiichi Maebara.`
`Why don't we quit thinking about this having to end one day?`
`...If it will, then just think about it when that happens.`
`There was one thing, however, that I could say for sure.`
`As long as I smiled like this, Satoko's own smile would never wane.`
`...So as long as I stay this way, this tranquility would never end.`
`...Satoshi would come back one day, too.`
`That might happen a lot further away than I'd like, but...`
`Until that day... what's wrong with me being a replacement for him?`
`Saying that I'm not her real brother, so I can't become Satoshi... that was just an excuse.`
`If I just didn't run away...`
` Satoko would stay happy, and live a fun life of annoyed nitpicking.`
`I don't know what happened to Satoshi... or what made him abandon Satoko and run away.`
`But just seeing Satoko in such a good mood...`
` made me think I could persevere as long as I needed to.`
`So this is what I thought:`
`I wouldn't become Satoshi—I would become a replacement brother.`
`"This is it!!`
` This is the kind of stir-fry I was waiting for!`
` It's great!`
` It's absolutely great!!`
` The salt and pepper in the broth... Man!`
` I could eat an entire pot of this!!"`
`"Stop that, Keiichi-san!`
` You're spilling food everywhere!`
` The food isn't going to run away—you don't need to eat it so fast!"`
`"No, it WILL run away!`
` The best and freshest flavors are running away from the moment the meal is completed. `
`If you were to make a hundred delicious things, then I would have a duty to taste every one of them!`
` It's just good manners to do so!"`
`"Your feelings are more than enough!!`
` So calm down and enjoy your food!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` You're right, I'm sorry."`
`No insults here.`
`I meekly scratched my head, then put down my chopsticks and laughed along with her like it was funny.`
`I ended up doing most of the eating.`
`Satoko was barely taking a bite—she seemed satisfied just by watching me enjoy the food so much.`
`Whenever I filled my mouth with more of her delicious meal, Satoko looked glad.`
` That let me enjoy the food even more.`
`In this way, she kept smiling happily the whole time.`
`...Looking at her made me really happy as well...`
`...The time passed, softly and gently.`
`Before, I would have gone back and forth hurling insults with Satoko; in other words, we would have gotten into a fight right away.`
`...I'd never known I could feel such peace of mind by talking to her honestly like this.`
`...I was a little bit happy about having discovered this new side of Satoko.`
`For example...`
`I was eating food that Satoko had made.`
` There wasn't an inch of me that thought it was suspicious.`
`Before, however, Satoko would have definitely put some sort of a trap into this...`
`"...Mm.`
` I think I ate too much.`
` I'm gonna take a dump."`
`"Hey, Keiichi-san!`
` It's bad manners to say such words during a meal!"`
`"Then what should I say?`
` I'm going to the bathroom?`
` The toilet?`
` The lavatory?"`
`Satoko looked down, her face bright red, and pointed down the hallway as if to say "just go already!"`
`Whoops, my old habits seem to have come back.`
`...But... yeah.`
`This wasn't all that bad either.`
`No weird schemes—everything is just natural.`
`...And, while having such utterly unguarded thoughts, I went into the bathroom...`
`Tug.`
`My foot caught on something string-like.`
` ......Huh...?`
`Whoa?!`
`Bang,`
` ker-slam!!`
` Gyahh-oh?!`
` Rattle rrraaattle!!!`
`"A kettle?!`
` A washtub?!`
` S-Satokoooooooooo!!!"`
`She got me...`
` I can't believe her...`
` She always does this when I let my guard down!`
`I can't relax for a minute around her.`
`...Still, it was kind of funny, and I didn't really feel like getting angry.`
`Satoko, laughing uproariously, came over.`
`"See? See?!`
` I knew you would fall for it sooner or later!!"`
`"Why, you little...!!`
` I let my guard down for one second... and this is what I get!!"`
`I picked up the washtubs that had crashed into my head and went to go hit Satoko with it...`
` but then I doubled over with the laughter that was been welling up within me, so I couldn't manage it.`
`...I wished things could go on forever like this...`
`It's not like I was having the most fun since coming to Hinamizawa or anything.`
`But... it was probably the first time... that I'd spent my day so simply and comfortably.`
`It really wasn't worth much... it was only a few hours, after all.`
`As an only child... it was my first taste of having a sibling.`
`Just washing dishes with her felt really nice.`
` ...Side by side we washed, with the experienced Satoko doing most of the work as I threw in appropriate words to add to the conversation.`
`The scene was so commonplace... and yet so mild and warm.`
`...Maybe I had felt this kind of warmth before too, in the past.`
`I think I've stood next to the sink with my mother like this when I was little.`
`It made me feel nostalgic when I remembered it.`
` ...It was the same sort of slow, easy time.`
`It was tranquil.`
`Such a quiet tranquility that the fact I wasn't uneasy about anything itself almost made me uneasy.`
`...Hey, wait, Keiichi Maebara.`
`You feel uneasy about something just from spending time so leisurely?`
`There's nothing at all to feel uneasy about.`
`...I mean, why would I be punished for enjoying a gentle life?`
`I'd do anything to keep these days going, and I would never do anything bad, no matter what.`
`I'd work hard for it, and endure much for it.`
`So, God...`
`It's not much of a dream to want this kind of thing to keep on going, but can't you grant it...?`
`"...Oh?`
` Is that not the telephone?`
` Who could it be at this hour?"`
`"...Hm?`
` Oh, you're right."`
`I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it.`
` ...I hurried to stand up, then ran to the phone.`
`Who could it be at a time like this?`
`I did feel a little like the phone had interrupted my happy moment...`
`But I still wanted to brag about how happy the time I was spending made me, no matter who it was on the other side.`
`"Hello?`
` ...This is Maebara speaking."`
`"...Hello?`
` Keiichi?`
` It's your mother."`
`"Oh, hello, Mom.`
` ...What is it?`
` It's pretty late."`
`That was a little cold of me, when she was only calling because she was worried about her son.`
`I couldn't help but give myself a dry smile.`
`"It sounds like you're doing just fine for yourself.`
` I was worried that you couldn't make dinner and went to bed hungry."`
`"Nah.`
` It worked out."`
`"Did you make dinner properly?`
` What did you have tonight?"`
`"Heh heh.`
` It was vegetable stir-fry, rice, and miso soup.`
` Bought stuff for it at the supermarket, plus a whole bunch of side dishes just for fun!`
` Oh, yeah, listen to this! `
`I got the pork during the sale and got it half off!`
` Heh heh!`
` The things a housewife knows, right?`
` And, and also...!!"`
`All of that was thanks to Satoko, and not something I should be proud about.`
`But still... I couldn't help but want to boast about the dinner tonight.`
`It seemed like Mom got the hint that I was in a really good mood.`
`"...I see.`
` I'm so relieved that you're doing just fine.`
` ...Oh, yes, another thing.`
` Your dad and I finished up with our job.`
` We think we'll be back tomorrow afternoon or evening."`
`"...Oh, I see."`
`"You did well for two nights.`
` We've been pulling all-nighters, too.`
` It was a lot of work, but we managed to fill the gap in your dad's mentor's event."`
`"Cool.`
` ...That's good.`
` Well done."`
`Why did my parents coming home seem so disappointing?`
`...I knew a little bit of the reason, of course.`
`This tranquility I never wanted to end was about to end so readily... and it was a little painful.`
`After being asked what kind of souvenir I wanted from Tokyo and replying that anything edible would be great, I put down the receiver, and Satoko appeared, having finished cleaning up her trap.`
`At first, Satoko was in a very good mood... but when she saw me put down the receiver with an uncertain expression, her own clouded over a bit.`
`...It seemed like she'd gotten the gist of what my phone conversation had been about.`
`"...Was that your parents, Keiichi-san?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Mom says they'll be back tomorrow."`
`"Oh, that's good, then.`
` I won't have to go to the trouble of making you dinner tomorrow!`
` Now you can enjoy your meals with just your family!"`
`"No, that's not it.`
` When I think about the dull, plain dinner table coming back tomorrow... it's a little lonely."`
`"You sure do live in luxury!`
` A family sitting around the dinner table is the most fun way to enjoy a meal of all."`
`...Her brother, Satoshi, running away from home came to mind immediately.`
`But there was no gloom in the way she said it.`
`"It was only for two days... but they were very enjoyable dinners."`
`"Well, then...`
` Next time I'll go to your house to visit."`
`"Huh?"`
`Satoko momentarily made a happy smile, but then a second later, it changed to an expression of surprise.`
`"M-My house is small, and it's dirty!`
` And the kitchen isn't as good at this one..."`
`"Well, I don't mind.`
` ...But, well, if you don't want to, then I won't."`
`Satoko shook her head firmly, her whole body expressing denial.`
`"I gotta get you to teach me a whole bunch more stuff, too.`
` ...I finally managed to figure out how to use the rice cooker and how to cook miso soup, after all."`
`"Th... that's right, isn't it!`
` Perhaps we should use this opportunity to have you learn more about cooking!"`
`It was so like Satoko to take this chance to proclaim that it was all for my sake.`
`But there was no way to conceal her own enthusiasm.`
`It was true that this gentle time would come to an end when my parents got back.`
`...There was no need to lament that, though. I can easily put in the effort to continue our mild moments like this.`
`Like yesterday, Satoko told me she didn't need to be escorted home.`
`But Rika-chan wasn't with her tonight.`
`She would be going home by herself.`
`...Everyone knew everyone else's face here in Hinamizawa...`
`So it wasn't like it was dangerous to go out at night, but it still wasn't good to send a girl on her way all alone.`
`...At the very least, that's what I thought as Satoko's 'older brother.'`
`"I'll take you as far as the school, at least.`
` There's more lights over in that direction anyway."`
`"I-It's really fine, all right?!`
` If someone bad shows up, I will take them down with one finger!"`
`There was no point in pressing her any more on the subject, so I took a handful of Satoko's hair and rubbed her head vigorously.`
`"Come on, Satoko, don't complain so much!`
` ...Uhh..."`
`Your Nii-nii will bring you part of the way there.`
`...That's what I was about to say when I suddenly got embarrassed and my voice trailed off.`
`Nii-nii could only be the nickname Satoko gave to her old brother, and nothing else.`
`...I was about to use it pretty lightly... so I started to feel apologetic and a little ashamed.`
`"...Nii-nii."`
`Eh?`
` ...What did Satoko just say?`
`"Ah, well...!!`
` ...K-Keiichi-san just seems like an older brother.`
` That is, what I said... it's not quite right, but... you seem kind of alike, so I just...`
` Oh, oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!"`
`Satoko laughed awkwardly and turned red in the face.`
`Of course, I was embarrassed when I saw her, too.`
`...Because the fact that I was trying to act like her brother had gotten across.`
`A warm feeling spread out from my chest...`
`It was completely different from romantic feelings, or any of those more impatient emotions.`
`...It was much more graceful, quiet, and warm... and calm.`
`......Satoko...`
` still needed her Nii-nii.`
`I had initially thought Rika-chan was being sly by not coming today.`
`...But when I thought about it like this...`
` I could feel a kind thoughtfulness, of her worrying about a good friend's feelings.`
`Maybe Rika-chan had understood... that she couldn't play the part of a brother herself.`
`...So then.........`
` No, let's stop there, Keiichi Maebara.`
`There's no point in thinking about it so hard.`
`...It means everyone feels the same way.`
`It means... everyone wants Satoko to be happy.`
`Satoko is acting as though her Nii-nii running away from home didn't bother her at all...`
`Even though that wasn't actually the case.`
`...She was very sad... and always waiting for him to come home.`
`Because Satoko... was a stable person when she was his sister.`
`In order for her to really be this level-headed, having a brother was something she couldn't do without.`
`...In other words... Satoko still needed a brother.`
`Nobody had the right to smile it away as childish immaturity.`
`In fact, they deserved praise for being so close to each other as siblings.`
`That role of brother should be played by her real Nii-nii, by Satoshi... but unfortunately, he wasn't here.`
`So since I'm here, I'll play the part.`
`And not with a guilty conscience—but in a very natural way.`
`Because...`
` Was there something wrong with seeing Satoko smile so happily...?`
`"What is it, Keiichi-san?`
` You've been smirking for quite a while now...!"`
`"Is it weird for me to look happy?"`
`"I-It isn't weird or anything, but......`
` well..."`
`The sound of the motor on her bike light was too loud and I couldn't hear what Satoko said.`
`"Huh?`
` What?`
` What did you say?"`
`"...Nothing.`
` You really are just like Nii-nii, you know.`
` Keiichi-san."`
`".........Is that right?"`
`"...Of course, you're completely different from my real Nii-nii...`
` ...But, like... there's things.`
` ...Things that you do the same.`
` ...It's really a mystery."`
`"...The same... Do you feel lonely when you remember Nii-nii...?"`
`Once I said that... I thought for a moment that was absolutely the wrong thing to say, but Satoko didn't seem to mind one bit.`
`"It's not that I'm lonely.`
` Since Keiichi-san is being my Nii-nii for me right now!`
`Um... well, I...!"`
`As I was flustered for a moment at her hitting the mark... Satoko suddenly asked me a question in a calm voice.`
`...It was very quiet, composed, and adult question.`
`"...Was it Rika?"`
`It was quiet... but her voice sounded lonely somehow.`
`"...Didn't Rika ask you...`
` to act like my Nii-nii for me...?"`
`"...Is that what you think?"`
`"...Please don't take offense.`
` ...Rika... is strangely considerate of me.`
` ...But it really doesn't bother me that much."`
`...I could say for sure that, at least, was a lie.`
`...Yesterday, and today...`
`Satoko had been so happy spending time like this with me as siblings.`
`And that was proof itself that she was lying about it not getting to her.`
`So I gave Satoko a light poke in the head.`
`".........`
`You're thinking too much, dummy.`
` ...I'm me—Keiichi Maebara.`
` I'm not your Nii-nii—not Satoshi Houjou."`
`"...I know that."`
`Despite her saying that... her expression seemed a little lonesome.`
`...At this point, Satoko herself had realized that her question had been the wrong thing to say.`
`We didn't need to keep talking about something that Satoko regretted.`
`So in order to cut the conversation short, I grabbed Satoko's head and pet her.`
`"Let's not talk about silly things like that.`
` It's getting late, so get back home, brush your teeth, and go to bed!`
` And rinse your mouth before sleeping, too!`
` It'll keep you from getting a cold."`
`"Y-You're one to talk, Nii-nii!`
` Be sure to brush your teeth, okay?!`
` Rinse your mouth and wash your hands, then get your books ready tomorrow... And, and!!"`
`......I wondered what kind of siblings Satoko and Satoshi were.`
`...I've never seen them together... but I could say without a doubt that they were really close.`
`...As for the way in which they were close...`
` It was probably quite like this.`
`It was so cool that the day's heat seemed like a lie, and yet the moonlight was somehow faintly warm.`
` The quiet chorus of the insects was pleasing to the ears...`
