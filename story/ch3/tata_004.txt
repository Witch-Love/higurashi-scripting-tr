`"All right then, I'm off!"`
`"Look out for cars!`
` Be back before dinnertime!"`
`Today was the day of the barbecue party that was the Hinamizawa Fighters' victory celebration.`
`Of course, I, having prepared myself, skipped breakfast in order to stay hungry.`
`...Though with all the club members coming, it was pretty possible there would be a contest based on how fast or how much you could eat!`
`Rena was already at our usual meeting place.`
` Mion arrived a few minutes later.`
`"Great!`
` Let's get going!`
` This old man skipped breakfast and is starving to death!"`
`"I expected nothing less!`
` I, too, went without breakfast—and am now in top physical condition!!"`
`"Wow, you two—skipping breakfast is bad for your health.`
` Rena made sure to eat something."`
`"Yeah, yeah, you're great, Rena.`
` Breakfast is an important part of the day.`
`"Hau, the dirty magazines~`
` If I get a nice body, then maybe a prince on a white horse will come for Rena too? For Rena too?"`
`"...Definitely not happening.`
` If you won't take responsibility for them, Kei-chan, then don't give Rena any silly ideas.`
` ...She might start eating breakfast three times a day starting tomorrow."`
`...Yeah, I could see Rena doing that.`
`...Wait, who did this gluttonous princess think was going to come for her...?`
`"Well, anyway!`
` We're all nice and hungry!`
` Let's go and treat ourselves at the big barbecue party!!"`
`""Yeaaahhh!!""`
`The venue for said barbecue was to be the Furude Shrine grounds where Rika-chan lived.`
`They held events and festivals there, and barbecues too.`
`It was the place that held all sorts of ceremonies in Hinamizawa.`
`(...Come to think of it, there was supposed to be a big village festival coming up, wasn't there?`
` "Watanagashi" or something...)`
`The scenery you could see from that high up was fairly superb—and the calm atmosphere particular to shrines was something fairly difficult to find in the city.`
`We left our bicycles at the bottom of the shrine steps and broke into a mad dash up the stairs!`
`When we arrived on the shrine grounds... the Hinamizawa Fighters and their fathers had already gathered and had begun setting up for the barbecue early.`
`Of course, Satoko and Rika-chan were there as well.`
`When they noticed our arrival, they waved to us.`
`"Oh, so you managed not to forget about this!`
` Curses! If you all hadn't come, there would have been that much more meat for me.`
` How truly disappointing it is!"`
`"You underestimate us, Satoko!`
` Now that we've arrived, you don't think you'll be able to have even one bite of that fabulously marbled beef, do you?! `
` Remember when we ate our bento here?`
` You and I have a fatal difference in reach—I'll be overwhelming you once again!!"`
`"W-W-Whaaaaat?!`
` I-I cannot allow that to happen by any means!!"`
`"Cry and shout all you want—you'll just be watching us fill our mouths with beef.`
` Don't worry, though!`
` We'll give the peppers and onions to you!!"`
`"...I'll give Satoko lots and lots of the grilled squash too."`
`When Satoko heard the word "squash," her complexion changed color.`
`When she took my overwhelming reach into account, she knew it wasn't just a threat—it could actually happen.`
`"I'll go tell the coach.`
` I'll tell him you really love squash!`
` If it's for you, I bet he'll get a whole mountain of specialty squash from all over Japan!"`
`"Wow, good for you, Satoko!!`
` You'll have your pick of the squash!!`
` You can have squash from dawn till dusk—three meals a day!!!"`
`"Waaahhhhhhhhhh!!`
` Rena, Rena~!`
` Everyone's bullying me!!"`
`Satoko tried to leap into Rena's chest!!`
`Oh no... Clearly, given another second, Rena's mach punches would have us piled on the ground!!`
`...So just before Satoko hit Rena, I grabbed her by the nape of the neck and pulled her back...!!`
`A superb reaction with only seconds of foresight... at least, it was supposed to be.`
`...But for Rena, when I caught the leaping, crying Satoko, it looked I was keeping her to myself.`
`Bam bam baaammmmmm!!!`
`"Hau~~♪`
` No, no, no, Keiichi-ku~n,`
` this is Rena's, okay~?`
` I'm~taking her home~~♪"`
`"Wahhhh, Rena-san~!`
` Beat up Mion-san and Rika like that too~!!"`
`"Whoa, whoa... hold on there!!`
` Gyahhhh!!!"`
`Bam bam baaammmmmm!!!`
`"Okay!!`
` Now where could Rika be?!`
` There she is!!`
` Rena-san, over there!!"`
`"Just wait, Satoko-chan, I'll take care of her right away~!!`
` Then I'm bringing you straight home~!!!"`
`"...Meep!`
` Meeeeeeep!!`
` Satoko, you're mean!"`
`"Hau~~!!`
` Rika-chan's so kyute too!!`
` Hau~~~ I'm gonna take her home~!!"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!!`
` Rika!`
` It serves you right!!!"`
`Satoko laughed in a shrill voice at Rika-chan and Rena's unproductive game of tag while we watched them, sprawled out on the ground...`
`"A-Are you all right, Maebara-san?`
` Sonozaki-san...?"`
`The coach came over and lent us a hand.`
`"Yeah, this is just how we communicate, that's all.`
` Don't mind us!"`
`"...If the way we communicate ends up leaving bruises on my face, then I don't want any more to do with it..."`
`"You never learn, do you?" laughed the coach loudly.`
` It made us start to laugh too.`
`Satoko's laughter, Rika-chan's yelling, and Rena's strange voice were kind of comfortable to hear.`
`The adults here knew what they were doing, so the barbecue was ready in short order.`
`As the salad oil dripped down onto the plate with a hiss, there was a loud cheer.`
`When the coach brought over a big plate with all the meat on it, we all cheered again.`
`"Wow, this meat looks amazing!`
` Coach, you really did splurge on it!"`
`"I did make a promise.`
` Can you tell how much all of this weighs?`
` It really did cost me a lot!"`
`"Of course it did!`
` Third-rate meat wouldn't be enough of a reward for everything I did yesterday!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` Yeah!`
` Satoko-chan's definitely the guest of honor today!"`
`"Yeah, Satoko was the one who hit that last home run, after all.`
` She might have caught the guy off guard, but the arc it flew was long and true!!"`
`"...Satoko is pretty athletic."`
`"Not bad at all—she could be one of the best of our generation!`
` She doesn't fall behind in physical ability even compared to me."`
`"Maybe Satoko-chan has a big future in the world of sports!"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!! Stop singing my praises—you're making me blush~!!"`
`"...Munch munch."`
`Satoko, for whom the excessive praise made her not notice the moderately grilled meat being stolen one after the other, was just far too cute...`
`"Maebara-saaan! T...This is heavy...!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were carrying something over to us.`
`It was a huge barbecue plate.`
`"Whoa!!`
` The barbecue's protagonist has arrived!"`
`The plate was chock full of skewers with vegetables and meat on them.`
`The grilled, burning hot meat juices made a 'shhsh' noise as they drizzled off.`
` ...Gulp!`
`You need a lot of heat for cooking something on a metal skewer, so they had grilled the whole plate at once.`
`"Yep, can't have a barbecue without some of these!"`
`"You can say that again!`
` I'll help out, so let's get it over there.`
` Up we go!"`
`"Wow!!`
` Look, look!`
` It's amazing!!"`
`Everyone greeted us with a cheer.`
`Each person received a skewer with vegetables and big pieces of meat on it.`
`They also received paper cups filled to the brim with juice.`
`In my right hand were pounds of piping hot barbecue.`
`In left was a cup of juice that I could chug down!`
`If this didn't make you want to dance, you weren't a man!`
`"Ahhhh, I can't hold back any longer!!`
` I'm gobbling it down!!`
` Gobble gobble!!"`
`"Not just yet, Kei-chan.`
` We've got a little ceremony first."`
`"Can I have your attention, everyone~?"`
`The coach, with a cup of beer in his hand, mounted the nearby beer cooler.`
`This was supposed to be a victory celebration, after all.`
` We needed an opening statement.`
`...Damn—I hope it ends soon!`
`For every second this goes on for, a little more of the food's freshness goes away!!`
`Nwohh?! ...Satoko stomped down onto the back of my foot!`
`"My word!`
` Men your age are so greedy.`
` Can you not wait a little more elegantly?"`
`"...Is everything I'm thinking really showing on my face...?"`
`"Okay, is everyone listening?`
` We won a huge game yesterday. `
`It had become a hard battle after that amazing pitcher came in,`
` but thanks to equally-reliable saviors on our side, we scored a beautiful turnaround victory."`
`Clap clap clap!`
`Both my hands were full, so the adults and older brothers gave us a round of applause.`
`"This is to celebrate that victory.`
` As promised, I got a ton of delicious meat for everyone.`
` Eat as much as you want and use that energy on our next game!"`
`Then, after a few words of thanks to the fathers and brothers who helped with the barbecue, he led us in a toast.`
`""""Cheeeeeeeers!!!""""`
`They say that when toasting, you would normally down the contents of your cup.`
`But we were young!`
`At the toast, all of us immediately began to dig into our skewers!`
`After that... it got really lively, with everyone congratulating one another for things they did during the game.`
`Like how someone made a great catch, or how awesome someone looked when stealing a base.`
`Of course, they congratulated me too, the savior who appeared to fight against the Koshien pitcher.`
`"Well, even what I did was all thanks to Satoko."`
`"Satoko did have a plan.`
` But you're the only one who could have won over Kameda like you did, Kei-chan.`
` You did more than enough to deserve praise!"`
`"By the way, Keiichi-kun, you went to eat cake with Kameda-kun after that, didn't you?`
` You looked like you were best friends."`
`"The seeds of friendship sprouting between male rivals—something like that? Ahahahaha!"`
`"...That's sort of...`
` well, it's...`
` ufufufufufufufu, hau~~~...☆"`
`...I violently brushed through Rena's hair as she turned red in the face for some reason at the mention of friendship between males, dispersing her pleasant-seeming ideas...`
`Now then, where's the hero—or rather, the heroine, Satoko?`
` ...Oh, there she is.`
`Satoko was with Rika-chan, in the middle of bragging her heart out about the home run yesterday.`
`And her teammates spared no compliment for her—since even though he was going easy on her, the fact that she hit a throw from a Koshien pitcher was something else.`
`Satoko was more loquacious than usual—it seems she was in a great mood.`
`She was flying so high that I thought for a moment about getting a word in to tease her...`
` But she was the leading actress today, so I decided not to bully her at all.`
`As I watched Satoko, going at things as lively as usual under the sun, it struck me that it didn't quite line up with the pleasant time I'd spent with her.`
`But both of those were the real Satoko.`
`I didn't care which it was—her smiling happily, or making a big, lively fuss like this.`
`Just as long as she would keep smiling like this forever.`
`"...She looks like she's having fun.`
` Quite a lot of it."`
`The coach had approached me from behind before I realized it.`
`As he gazed at Satoko from afar, like I had been doing, he addressed me.`
`...So I could tell he was talking about her.`
`"Doesn't it just cleanse your soul to see Satoko-chan smiling?"`
`He smiled, refreshed, searching for confirmation.`
`I felt a little embarrassed to admit it, so against my better judgment, I played it off.`
`"R-Really?`
` ...I don't think her smile could cleanse so much as a plate."`
`"Hu-hu-hu-hu.`
` I'm sure Satoko-chan would be mad if she heard that,`
` but that part of her is very cute too."`
`...Leaving her cuteness aside, I could understand him thinking Satoko getting angry for being teased would be funny.`
`"Umm... Mr. Iria, was it?"`
`"It's Irie.`
` Everyone else calls me Coach, though.`
` I'd be very happy if you called me Coach as well, Maebara-san."`
`As he said that, Coach Irie smiled, blushing a little.`
`"Coach... You seem to like Satoko a lot."`
`I didn't have any real basis for saying that—it was just what I felt to be true.`
`"Yes.`
` I do like her.`
` I love her, in fact.`
` When she gets older, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me."`
`"Uh... Whaaaaaaaat?!?!"`
`This guy... really says some insane stuff, doesn't he?!`
`...After being astonished by this, I hurried to put my mind back in order.`
`I'd heard that this Coach guy was the kind of person who said crazy things out of nowhere.`
`According to Mion, if I took everything he said seriously, I physically wouldn't be able to take it.`
`If I was able to ignore that part of him, he seemed like he'd be a really funny guy...`
`"Hm?`
` Um, Maebara-san.`
` Did that surprise you?`
` Could it be... you're going after Satoko-chan yourself?`
` That would bother me, then.`
` I've been going after her for decades now, you know."`
`"Coach, Satoko hasn't even been alive for much more than a decade..."`
`"Hm? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."`
`Coach gave a dry grin and laughed.`
`Was this how I should be doing it?`
`I must somehow master the art of responding to this Coach guy...`
`After that, I received many words of praise for my actions—almost too many.`
`As that conversation was happening...`
`Leaving aside the controversial statements this Coach person would spout suddenly, I learned he was very composed, and not a bad guy by any stretch.`
`"I think Satoko deserves more praise for that crazy home run she got.`
` ...I honestly didn't think she had it in her."`
`"Satoko-chan's older brother was more the quiet bookworm type.`
` She probably inherited the exact opposite skill set."`
`...Her brother?`
` Right, he meant Satoshi.`
`The one who left Satoko... and ran away from home—Satoko's Nii-nii.`
` Satoshi Houjou.`
`"Do you not know about him?`
` Satoko-chan's older brother, I mean.`
` His name is Satoshi Houjou-kun,`
` and he played with the Hinamizawa Fighters too.`
` I wanted him to play a lot more......`
` but then he transferred."`
`"Huh...`
` I see..."`
`...So he 'transferred.'`
`...Yeah, maybe that was... a little more considerate than saying he ran away.`
`Now that he mentioned it, I think it was Rena...`
` I think she said Satoshi transferred too.`
`I didn't know the details of him having run away from home at the time, so I didn't pay much attention to it, but...`
`............`
`"Only her brother transferred?`
` ...That's sort of unusual."`
`...Everyone having fun was far away... and their cheerful voices distant.`
`The chorus of the cicadas separated us from them, giving me a sense of distance.`
`At first, I thought my own voice was too soft for even me to hear...`
` but for a really long time, Coach didn't respond to my words...`
` so at this point, I began to wonder if I had said something I shouldn't have.`
`Just when I began to feel impatient, Coach finally spoke.`
`"...Something unfortunate happened.`
` A few things, actually."`
`After informing me that what he was about to say was a secret, Coach began to talk, a little at a time.`
`"...It's been three years already.`
` Right around this time of year, I think.`
` Satoko-chan's parents were in an accident."`
`"...An accident?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...At a public park they visited while on vacation, they fell from a viewing platform."`
`It was supposed to just be a little time away from the house with the family.`
`They went for a walk on a path through a nature park after it had rained.`
`...There was a little viewing platform that looked like it had a good view.`
` ...That was the stage on which the tragedy was set.`
`The metal fixtures in the viewing platform fence had deteriorated from time...`
` and with all the rain they had just gotten... they might have loosened somewhat.`
`Right before Satoko's eyes...`
` both the fence......`
` and her parents fell.`
`There was a river some tens of meters below...`
`The water level was high due to the rain,`
` and apparently very muddy.`
`"...And... her parents......?"`
`Coach gave a thin but melancholic smile and touched his paper cup to his lips.`
`...Without saying anything... I knew how unfortunate that accident was, and how Satoko's parents had left on an eternal vacation...`
`"...Umm...`
` Then Satoko is............`
` well."`
`I was so focused on being careful with my words... that I lost what I was going to say.`
`A single word—orphaned.`
`I knew how little consideration it showed and how much it would hurt Satoko without having to say it aloud.`
`Come to think of it...`
`Satoko lived with Rika-chan...`
` At least, that's what I thought I heard from others.`
`...Wait... Rika-chan, her father died from illness too... and her mother soon after...`
`...I felt like I heard she was living by herself...`
`"Yes.`
` She's living with Furude-san right now.`
` ...They've probably lived many discouraging days without any parents, but they've gotten along by helping each other."`
`".................."`
`"Going on living without the protection of parents... is very difficult for kids that age, I think.`
` Maebara-san, you can probably understand that as well."`
`...I've only survived because I rely on my parents, so the only reply I could give was to nod...`
`"Furude-san is particularly beloved by the older people in the village.`
` As long as she's here, she won't want for much."`
`"Come to think of it, you're right.`
` Rika-chan kind of seems like the village mascot sometimes.`
` ...I don't think she'd have a hard time living here."`
`Rika-chan could go "meep" just once and get two or three croquettes from a vendor, after all.`
`I felt like if she asked for help, everyone in the village would.`
`"But that only applies to Furude-san in particular.`
` ...Satoko-chan doesn't have it the same way."`
`Rika being so spoiled was just an exception.`
`...Upon thinking about it normally... living on your own as a child should be fraught with difficulty.`
`It wasn't, then, very difficult to imagine how much suffering Satoko had to go through just to live.`
`It wasn't very difficult to imagine.`
`...Was I really...`
` thinking that?`
`...No, I was only thinking the words...`
` I couldn't imagine it in the slightest.`
`How was I supposed to imagine it when I saw that annoying smile of hers?`
`...There was no way I could.`
`...I found out she was living apart from her brother, and I just kind of... vaguely thought that it was rather unfortunate.`
`I mean... Satoko was smiling so energetically every single day.`
`...Was I thinking that her smiling...`
` meant she wasn't hurt?`
` ...That she didn't feel lonely?`
`When she found out my parents were coming home the other night, Satoko said,`
`"A family sitting around the dinner table is the most fun way to enjoy a meal of all."`
`Those words... held a lot more weight now.`
`"I've seriously considered adopting her."`
`"...Huh... Adoption...?"`
`"It's a secret."`
` After warning me, Coach put his index finger to his lips.`
`"I've lived a really steady life all these years.`
` ...I have money, and a good reputation.`
`But marriage is the one thing I never got around to.`
` ......By law, obviously a single individual can't adopt a child.`
` So I... can't make Satoko-chan my adopted daughter. `
`...Ha-ha-ha-ha—what a shame.`
` Didn't take long for my plan to get her to call me Papa to hit a setback."`
`This guy spouts some crazy stuff...`
`At first, I was only half-listening.`
`...But... midway through, I realized how rude that was.`
`This "Coach" person...`
` seriously only wished for this one girl, Satoko, to be happy.`
`That was neither crazy nor was it nonsense.`
`...He just wanted her to be happy...`
` those were his true feelings.`
`"Satoko-chan's current lifestyle is probably not a very happy one.`
` ...But, you know...`
` I want to make it easier for her, even if it's only a little. `
`Hahahaha—of course, I can't do much for her but share my leftover food and do errands that she's not strong enough to do..."`
`"......You're wrong. Satoko's happy."`
`"Huh?"`
` Coach showed surprise at my having declared that.`
`"...There are so many people all around her that really want her to be happy.`
` She can't possibly feel otherwise."`
`I spoke with a serious expression, quietly... but firmly, all the same.`
`It was my approval of his feelings... and my gratitude as Satoko's Nii-nii.`
`"...Thank you.`
` Still, keep this a secret from Satoko-chan, okay?`
` If she knew I wanted to adopt her, she'd probably get mad and call me a pervert for wanting me to call her papa.`
` ...Ha-ha-ha-ha."`
`...I wonder.`
`Satoko may have been somewhat childish, but she was still able to empathize with people.`
`She'd call him that.`
` I knew it.`
`As if my feelings had gotten across, Coach grinned, satisfied, and returned his gaze to the hustle and bustle before us.`
`Her parents, and her older brother.`
`...She lost her family, had no relatives... and was huddled up with Rika-chan, who was in the same situation.`
`Satoko Houjou.`
`...It wouldn't be odd for her to look at her life with despair, but she didn't seem to feel that way—she lived energetically with a smile.`
`"...I want her to keep smiling forever."`
`It was a naive wish... and yet it was one that he couldn't help hoping for.`
`...So... the words that I spoke were the same.`
`"What a coincidence.`
` I think the same way."`
`"Oh... You too, Maebara-kun?`
` Then that makes us friends.`
` ...Let's make a promise."`
`"A promise...?"`
`"It's a very simple one."`
` The Coach said this, giving me a grin.`
`"That we will never, ever... make her cry."`
`It was short and to the point.`
`"...Uh, yeah.`
` I promise too."`
`Coach nodded happily.`
`We exchanged no more words after that.`
`...We just sat there comfortably, gazing at Satoko and everyone else having a good time.`
`She'd certainly lost family, but there were people watching over her.`
` How reassuring must that have been?`
`"...Just hypothetically...`
` If you did adopt Satoko... what would you do?"`
`"Hmm, that's a tough one..."`
`Coach gave a wry, happy smile, then exaggeratedly tilted his head in contemplation.`
`"...Huh...`
` ......what?!?!"`
`How does this guy always pick the craziest time to say the craziest things?!`
`"U-Umm, Maebara-kun?`
` I, well... I haven't said anything yet...?"`
`"W-W-W-What are you talking about?!`
` I heard it loud and clear!"`
`"That's right.`
` Kei-chan, you do understand.`
` ...Then, with that, it's time for...~"`
`My hand shot out and grabbed Shion, smiling, waving, and about to leave, by the nape of her neck!`
`"Hey, wait right there.`
` Don't just show up out of nowhere and start saying crazy stuff!!"`
`"Speaking of saying crazy stuff, I thought the Satoko love talk you were having with the coach was pretty crazy too.`
` I can perform a reenactment of the adoption bit, want to see?"`
`"N-Nwahhhhhhhhh!!`
` You've been hiding ever since then?!"`
`"Kei-chan, you can't even beat my sister—you're a hundred years too early to challenge me.`
` Ku-ku-ku-ku!"`
`This was Shion Sonozaki.`
`The younger of the Sonozaki twins.`
`...Though she hadn't a scrap of the reserved quality you'd expect from a little sister.`
` She was a villain no better than her older sister Mion.`
`We met the other day in town and I dug myself into a hole when I mistook her for Mion.`
`Unlike Mion, Shion said she was living in Okinomiya, so I thought we'd never see each other again... but to think we actually would!`
`My frankly displeased expression didn't change a bit, either.`
`This must be what people mean when they say something is like water off a duck's back.`
`"Shion-san, you came!`
` I was disappointed because I thought you wouldn't make it."`
`"Well, I couldn't think of anything else to do, really.`
` I figured I'd come and tease you all a little."`
`"...Coach, why did you need to call Shion to our victory celebration?`
` How did she contribute to our team's win—"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Well, you see.`
` I'm actually the manager for the Hinamizawa Fighters."`
`"The manager?!`
` No way—then why weren't you at the game yesterday?!"`
`"That's because I'm like a ghost manager.`
` Teh-heh☆"`
`She seemed to think I'd forgive her if she stuck her tongue out and smiled.`
` She wasn't sorry at all!`
`"The match wasn't nearly as pretty without you there.`
` I won't tell you to come to practices, but couldn't you at least come to games to root for us like you used to...?"`
`"Hmm.`
` I'll think about it.`
` Maybe I will if Kei-chan joins the Hinamizawa Fighters?`
` I can't get into a cheering mood when there's no good-looking guy on the team."`
`"Hm...... huh?"`
`Did... did Shion just smoothly say something absurd...?`
`"S-S-S-S-S-S-Shioooooon!!!`
` You little... Where did you come from?!?"`
`Suddenly Mion came running over, latched onto my shoulders, and pulled me towards her.`
`"Ahhhh!`
` It's Mii-chan's little sister!!`
` Hello, Shii-chan~!"`
`"Hello, Rena-san.`
` I'm honored you remembered my name—we only met once!"`
`"Oh, not at all.`
` Thanks for remembering Rena's name too!"`
`"Cut the stupid greetings!!`
` You're not allowed to solicit Kei-chan!!`
` He's the hope of our club!!`
` Don't pull him out and put him in baseball like he's some kind of plant!!!"`
`Mion gave a low growl as she grappled my arm.`
`...She looked like a little girl desperately clinging to her toy.`
`"Ahahahahahahaha.`
` Yep, Keiichi-kun is the star rookie of our club.`
` We could never trade him away!"`
`Rena's smile hid a nonchalant bloodthirst.`
`She was blocking Shion's way, ready to unleash an ultimate attack if she got within two meters of me...!`
`...Ahhh...`
` I felt like... this was gonna turn into a bloody battle...`
`"Hmmm, ah-hahahahaha!`
` That's too bad.`
` We'll leave the negotiations for another time."`
`"You don't have the right to negotiate!!`
` Coach, why did you call Shion here too?!`
` She's a ghost member! She's been slacking off for the last year!!!"`
`"Ha-ha-ha-ha.`
` I just thought it would be even more fun if Shion-chan was here.`
` ...Yep.`
` It definitely worked."`
`...That was what he planned for all along.`
` Mission accomplished.`
`"Hey!`
` Kei-chan, come over here!`
` We're all playing a game!!`
` With strings attached, of course!!"`
`"Shii-chan, how about you?`
` The rules are simple and it'll be fun!"`
`"Hmm, should I?`
` I'll just win if I join in, after all.`
` I don't want to ruin my sister's presidential image."`
`Mion, now irritated, turned around with a glare...`
`"......Mgghhhhhhh..."`
`"What is it, my sister?`
` Should I join in to make this a battle of the siblings?`
` For your sake, I don't think we should—but if you want to?"`
`"B-Bleehhhhh!!`
` I won't let you play, Shion!!`
` We're leaving you out!`
` Bleh!!"`
`Whoa... Mion just avoided a direct confrontation.`
`...It seemed like the twins were completely incompatible with each other...`
`"You won't let her play?`
` I was looking forward to seeing you two face off."`
`"I hate Shion!!`
` I'm bad against her!!"`
`An angry Mion dragged me away.`
` ...Sliiiiiide.`
`"Do your best!`
` I'll be rooting for you!!`
` Go for it, Kei-chan! Yay~!"`
`Shion waved her hand at us, reveling in the bliss of teasing Mion.`
`All right!`
`Club activities had begun... which meant I needed to clear my mind!!`
`What was today's battle?!`
` Today's punishment game?!`
` I'd take anything on!!`
`"Okay, Keiichi-san!!`
` You should prepare yourself!`
` We're... going all-out today!!!"`
`"Great, bring it on!!`
` Satoko or not, I'll crush you all mercilessly!!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha!`
` Rena will profit from your battle and fish herself up a win~!!"`
`"...Then I'll get all the manta rays first and ride them to victory."`
`"Hau!`
` Rika-chan is flat like a manta ray~~~☆`
` I-I-I-I-I-I wanna take you home~~!!"`
`"Okay, everyone!`
` We have a lot of people today, so let's play something easy and simple!`
` Today's game is...!"`
`Everyone who lost the game dropped out and had to help clean up after the barbecue.`
`"Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` Ahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`Shion laughed more uproariously than anyone I'd ever heard when she saw my loser face.`
`...Okay, okay, was my getting bombed out of the game really that funny...?`
`"Man, oh, man... Kei-chan's face~!`
` He was like,`
` how can you still call yourselves human?!`
` Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`"Daaamn iiit... I had it all worked out when I bought up the scissors...!!`
` If only... if only Satoko and Rika-chan hadn't betrayed me...!!"`
`It was going great while we had maintained a united front...`
` but Satoko had been quicker to betray me than I her—she was just a tiny bit better than me!!`
` Urgh~!!`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were unanimously wearing "I told you so" faces.`
`...Incidentally, those two were victims of Satoko's traps pretty early on as well.`
`"...Damn...`
` I was trying to do well enough to make up for you two..."`
`And once again... for the showdown, it didn't matter.`
`Maybe this meant I still couldn't match up to the other members yet...`
`"You were going to have the lowest-ranked member of the club play a punishment game, weren't you?"`
`Shion remarked, as though forcing me to recall something I'd tried to forget, even for a moment.`
`"Um...`
` .........i-is that right...?"`
`"Come to think of it, Maebara-san, when you came up with the punishment game with the president, you looked really heated up... What on earth did you decide on?"`
`"Mgh......... ugh..."`
`"Earlier, Mion told me to get an Angel Mort uniform ready.`
` Does that have anything to do with it?`
` She told me to get the biggest size I could find."`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun... were giving me these complex, indescribable looks mixing empathy, pity, and the desire to see something scary, all at once...`
`"W-wahahahahahahaha!!`
` Wahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`All I could do now was laugh.`
`Strangely enough, the more I laughed, the more I felt like it was actually funny...`
`Ugahhhhhhh!!!`
` I looooooost!!`
`"Oh my...`
` Maebara-san, what's the matter?`
` You're smiling, crying, and howling."`
`"It's okay—he's just pretending not to like it.`
` He can't hide his excitement at the opportunity to gain valuable experience using the punishment game as an excuse.`
` Right?☆"`
`"W-Whooaaaarrgghhh!!`
` What do you mean valuable experieeennceeeeeee!!!"`
`I held my head in my hands in agony...`
`My state of mind could be summed up with a three letter word.`
`It was...`
` *sob*...`
`Coach gently put his hands on my shoulders.`
` ...Was he comforting me...?`
`"Maebara-san.`
` In times where you must accept hardship...`
` Yeeeah, it's nice, isn't it...♪"`
`Red in the face and indulging in his imagination, still holding my shoulders, Coach said`
` "Oh, Master~♪" and started twirling around like a ballerina...`
`...I had to wonder what kind of word associations he had going on in his head.`
`...At the very least, it was much different than what was in mine.`
`"...Tomita-kun.`
` Okamura-kun.`
` ...Your coach is pretty funny.`
` I'm surprised he can even be a coach."`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun exchanged glances and answered with dry smiles.`
`Then they added that he was a really nice person most of the time—which is something you'd normally say about a person like that.`
`The coach's questionable revolutions slowed to a stop, and then his expression returned to a clear, calm one, almost making what just happened seem like an illusion.`
` ...H-He can switch gears way too fast...`
`"Then let us start cleaning up.`
` Maebara-san, you seem quite strong.`
` Could you bring the plates over to the wash basins and clean them?"`
`"Right, on it!"`
`I hoisted the dirty barbecue plates, each with slimy oil clinging to it, and looked for the wash basins.`
`...Argh, these... these are heavy!`
`Where're the wash basins?`
` ...Over there?!`
`Figuring I should make it there before my arms gave out, I headed towards it at a trot.`
`A lot of the adults who had been helping out were using the wash basins, so I gave up and looked for a different set.`
`I asked them, and they told me there were more right by the assembly hall, too, so I decided to head that way.`
`Rather than multiple basins, there was just one faucet there.`
`I initially thought it would be too small to wash plates as big as these, but it would probably still be faster than waiting for a faucet to open up back there.`
`I turned the faucet and water much nicer-looking than it gushed forth.`
`I put a plate under the faucet and scrubbed it with my hand to try and rub it clean.`
` ...It didn't go very well.`
`"Here you go.`
` A sponge and dish soap.`
` You can't wash them with just water."`
`It was Shion.`
`...She threw a brand-new sponge and a container filled with cleaner to me.`
`"Oh, thanks."`
`"You should've just put them by the basins and left it to the grown-ups.`
` You're always doing the right thing."`
`...I got the feeling that wasn't quite a compliment.`
` I answered her with a forced smile.`
`"...I was surprised to learn you're the manager for the Hinamizawa Fighters.`
` I thought you didn't do stuff like that because it's too much of a bother."`
`"Yes.`
` It is quite a bother.`
` That's why I've stopped showing up entirely."`
`"Didn't Coach say he wanted you to come back?`
` You should pay a visit once in a while."`
`"Ahahahaha. If I feel like it, I guess."`
`Shion made it sound like the end of world could happen before she "felt like it."`
` ...Whoops.`
` I couldn't keep washing the dishes while preoccupied with conversation, so I decided to take my task seriously.`
`Shion neither offered to help nor got in my way—she just quietly watched the water flowing from the faucet...`
`"Oh, right, I heard something.`
` You were the star player in yesterday's game, weren't you?"`
`"Satoko hit the home run, so I think she was the real star player.`
` I didn't know she had those kind of reflexes.`
` It surprised me."`
`"She's totally different from Satoshi-kun.`
` There's not much doubt that all the athletic ability in the family went to her."`
`Shion smiled as she spoke, her eyes looking at something far away, betraying her reminiscence.`
`"...Satoshi-kun?"`
`"Satoko Houjou's older brother.`
` You know, Satoshi Houjou-kun?`
` ...Oh, right.`
` You just moved here this year, didn't you, Kei-chan?`
` ...You wouldn't have ever met him."`
`I was a little surprised that Shion knew about Satoshi.`
`"Never met him... but I know a little.`
` After their parents passed away...`
` he transferred to a different school, right?"`
`I avoided saying that he ran away from home, and used the slightly more vague words that everyone else did.`
`"......Transferred?`
` ...Who said anything like that?"`
`I hadn't yet realized that Shion's tone had changed slightly.`
`"Well, I mean...`
` Who was it, then...?`
` Yeah, I heard it from someone.`
` That he transferred."`
`"...Who?`
` You said that because you asked someone, right?"`
`"Who did I ask...? I don't really remember.`
` ...Even so, he transferred, so that's it, right?`
` Not like there's a problem with it."`
`"There is one.`
` Does that mean there's a record of his transfer?`
` To another school?`
` And that someone saw it?`
` Or heard about it?"`
`Around that time... I not only noticed how awfully caught up on this Shion was...`
` but also how startlingly dangerous her eyes had begun to look...`
`".........Shion...?`
` What's up... You look really serious..."`
`With that, Shion seemed to realize the expression she was making.`
`...She took a deep breath, pretended to fix her hair, and went back to her composed expression from before.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` But, Kei-chan.`
` You don't know much about Satoshi-kun, so please don't say that he transferred, or anything like that.`
` I'm serious.`
` ...Please."`
`...I realized I must have said something I shouldn't have.`
`...But I wasn't immediately sure of what I should apologize for... so I just said one safe word for now:`
` Sorry.`
`"...I just sort of heard he'd transferred, and believed it.`
` ...Was it actually something else?"`
`...It was, of course.`
`...Preceded by his parents, he had left his sister and "run away."`
` But I'd wanted to try and avoid using the words "run away"... so I pretended not to know.`
`Upon seeing my flustered reply, Shion realized she was intimidating me, and lowered her voice.`
`"Ah, I'm sorry...`
` I'm not blaming you for anything, Kei-chan.`
` I was being a little harsh.`
` I apologize."`
`"......I didn't really mind."`
`That was a fib.`
` ...I was actually a little scared, even.`
`...Was there something wrong with saying he ran away?`
`Was there some sort of misunderstanding in saying that he transferred?`
`But before I could ask her, she turned on her heel to leave.`
`"Hey, Shion..."`
`"Right, good luck with those.`
` Looks like your plate is last.`
` That's the last one you need to wash."`
`Her final remark reminded me of the dishes I had so easily forgotten about.`
`...So immersed in conversation were we that it got pretty late.`
`I turned the faucet again to get the water flowing faster.`
` ...Wssshhhhh!`
` I violently scrubbed the plate.`
`When I turned back around, Shion was no longer there.`
`By the time I'd finished washing the plates, most of the other things had been cleaned up.`
`The air had cooled off before I'd realized it—and as the heat that had stuck with us all day dispersed, a nice breeze started to blow.`
`"Okay everyone, can I have your attention?"`
`Coach got everyone together to make his closing remarks.`
` ...And with that, another fun day drew to its close.`
`In the end, Mion ended the game with a magnificent victory.`
`Satoko and Rika-chan, who had labored so hard to betray me, had fallen into a huge trap afterwards, leaving them frustrated about more than a few things.`
`"People who betray others will one day be betrayed themselves.`
` Never been more true, huh?"`
`"Mgahhhh!!`
` You're not the one I want to hear that from, Keiichi-san!!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` Rena didn't fall for anyone's tricks.`
` That's how I got second! Second!"`
`"...Rena doesn't buy into lies very easily.`
` She has a sharp wit."`
`I'm surprised.`
`She seems like she would fall for the first lie to come her way.`
`"Funny you should say that, Kei-chan.`
` You desired to prey upon others, and right away you became the prey instead! `
`Make sure you don't fall for those dumb schemes that promise higher returns the more friends you rope in, okay?"`
`"Yeah, yeah...`
` I'll try harder.`
` ...*sob*."`
`Even good friends will lay traps mercilessly and betray everyone in sight once they get into a serious enough game!`
`...But despite that, once it's all over, they can feel refreshed and laugh together.`
` ...It reminded me of how we were all such great friends.`
`"Anyways, I'm looking forward to Keiichi-san's punishment game!`
` However, can you really implement such a thing?`
` I would think the store manager would have a thing or two to say about it, no?"`
`"Hmm, I wonder.`
` Maybe Keiichi-kun will be reaaally kyute.`
` Kyute!`
` I kind of want to see~☆ Hau!"`
`"...I am on the edge of my seat.`
` I will trip him up and make him wipe the floor."`
`"Ah, that would be great! Ku-ku-ku!"`
`"Ugahhhhh!!!`
` Why couldn't I win now of all times?!`
` Whenever I think 'I'll definitely win today' and that 'I'll make someone else play the punishment game', I lose!! `
`Is it not enough?!`
` Do I not believe hard enough in victory?!`
` Uwooohhhhh...!!"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!`
` The wailing of the loser tastes like sweet honey!"`
`"...How sad, how sad."`
` Pat pat.`
`"This is how you get stronger, Keiichi-kun.`
` It's like I'm looking at Mii-chan from last year."`
`Mii-chan last year?`
`What—did she always lose and moan about it in the past?`
`How very interesting—I didn't know our undefeated president, Mion, was once like that...`
`"N-No need to talk about that!"`
`Mion hastily covered Rena's mouth.`
`Everyone watching burst out laughing.`
`Finally, Rika-chan pulled on Satoko's sleeve.`
`"...Okay.`
` We should be going soon."`
`"Oh... Yes, we must go shopping for dinner, mustn't we?"`
`I wanted to keep talking like this forever...`
` but it was getting late.`
`We split up with Satoko and Rika-chan and decided to get on our way home.`
`"All right, bye!`
` See you tomorrow at school!"`
`Everyone waved to each other and split up for the short time between now and tomorrow.`
`"Okay... let's go!"`
`We began walking down the tall staircase leading from the shrine grounds...`
`As the sun started to set, the afternoon's heat began to disappear as though it were never there.`
`Just listening to the chorus of the higurashi was enough to make me forget about how hot it had been today.`
`"Come to think of it, it's still June, huh?`
` We didn't have a rainy season at all this year—like, all of a sudden it's just summer, you know?"`
`Now that I thought about it, she was right.`
`It was June—the season of long rain, of hydrangeas and snails.`
`I haven't seen a real rainy season since transferring here.`
`"According to the weather forecast, it's supposed to get more rainy during the first part of the week.`
` They were warning people about heavy showers.`
` I hope it doesn't run into Watanagashi."`
`"That's right.`
` The rainy season's supposed to be rainy!`
` Rena likes all the rain in the rainy season."`
`"What? So much rain just makes me depressed!`
` Hey, Kei-chan!"`
`"Huh? ...Ah!"`
`I was a little spaced out, so I was late in answering Mion.`
`I was thinking back to my conversation with her sister.`
`When I said that Satoshi transferred... Shion clearly got angry.`
`...She was mad at me for saying something so careless.`
`I mean... It may have been a vague way of skirting around the fact that he ran away from home...`
` but I don't think it was so bad that Shion would need to feel mad about it.`
`...I wasn't really...`
` satisfied with it.`
`I felt like a child, completely ignorant of what he was being scolded for.`
`So my thoughts spilled out of my mouth in a very direct fashion.`
`"Satoko had a brother, right?`
` ...Named Satoshi, I think?"`
`".........What?"`
`As soon as I said the name 'Satoshi,' Rena and Mion both lost their relaxed, comfortable mood and made strange expressions.`
`...Should I have avoided talking about this?`
` That's what they made me think.`
`...But I've already said it, so that's that.`
`...And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested.`
`"What happened to Satoshi again?`
` ...Did he move away?"`
`That was such a transparent way of putting it... but in my desire to know everything, I feigned ignorance.`
`"...Umm.......... hmm..."`
`Mion turned around and looked to Rena for assistance.`
`Rena looked between us, then quietly and softly spoke.`
`"......Wait, did we not tell you?`
` ...He 'transferred out.'"`
`When I said those words to Shion, she got upset.`
` ...So I answered her with the same words Shion had given me.`
`"...Transferred... Who told you something like that?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`I had only intended to borrow Shion's words, but I said it exactly the same way she had—right down to the thorns in my voice.`
`...When I realized what I had done, I immediately tried to soften my remark.`
`"If he really transferred, there would be records of it at school and stuff, right?`
` But there's... is there actually anything like that?"`
`Mion and Rena... Their eyes grew wide—they were at a loss for words.`
`...I started to feel like I was doing something really bad.`
`......I thought they were only hiding the fact that Satoko's older brother ran away out of consideration for her.`
`"...I'm not trying to blame you for anything, okay?`
` I just... wanted to ask what happened to Satoshi, that's all..."`
`I wasn't trying to blame them.`
`The fact that I had to remind them... even looked like I was tormenting them with an impossible question.`
`...No, maybe I was actually bullying them.`
`Maybe I had lashed out of them in retaliation for Shion getting mad at me...`
`...This whole day had been so much fun, but now...`
`...Why did I go and say something that made all of that meaningless...?`
`I couldn't help but regret my own careless curiosity...`
`That's enough—let's drop it now...`
`As I was about to say that, Mion spoke up.`
`"Umm...`
` well...`
` it's not like we were hiding it, or lying.`
` I hope you understand, that's not what we were trying to do..."`
`Mion's tone conveyed her genuine awkwardness.`
` ...They sounded like the excuses of a child who'd been presented with evidence of her own mischief.`
`"...Satoshi,`
` well...`
` ...He didn't transfer schools."`
`...Mion said, resigning herself.`
`...But I felt bad for pushing her to say that.`
`So...`
` it's okay, Mion.`
` Let's stop talking about Satoshi.`
`Sorry for teasing you...`
`I wanted to apologize.`
` ......But right before that—`
`"He won't come back."`
`"...What?"`
`Unlike Mion's stammered reply, Rena was extremely clear and resolute.`
`"...He won't come back... What?"`
`"He won't come back home, ever since that day."`
`He won't come back... That was a very strange way of putting it.`
`Normally you would say that he "hadn't" come back "yet."`
`...At least, I thought you'd only say it like Rena did if he wasn't capable of coming back.`
`You wouldn't say it like that when talking about someone who ran away from home...`
`"...What do you mean, he won't come back?`
` Where did Satoshi go?"`
`"Don't know."`
`"..."`
`Rena's word choice felt very cold to me.`
`...It was so cold that I couldn't muster a response right away.`
`"...Well... she's right.`
` ...After that day, Satoshi hasn't returned home."`
`Mion noticed the deadlock between us and hurriedly followed up on what Rena had said.`
`"Well, that is... Everyone in the village searched for him, and we even got the police to help us look.`
` ...And, well... they started thinking that maybe he ran away."`
`"...They started thinking he maybe ran away?"`
`When running away from home... I thought you were supposed to leave a note or something.`
`So when Satoshi ran away...`
` he would probably have left some kind of a letter apologizing to Satoko—that was just kind of what I figured.`
`...But... from the way Mion was talking... it seemed a little different than just... running away from home.`
`"...The police did an investigation.`
` Umm... Satoshi had been earning money at a part-time job, and had some put aside...`
` And they learned that on the day he vanished, he withdrew it all. `
`...And then, at Nagoya Station or something, they spotted someone who looked a lot like Satoshi..."`
`He withdrew all his savings to fund his escape from home... was that it?`
`...It seemed consistent enough to me...`
` But before I could say anything—`
`"I think that's a lie.`
` Satoshi-kun didn't run away,"`
` declared Rena shortly.`
`"...Hey, wait.`
` ...So if he didn't transfer schools,`
` or move away,`
` and he didn't run away from home...`
` Then what on earth..."`
`"...Stop it, Rena."`
`Mion whispered to her.`
`Rena, however, continued without interruption.`
` And...`
` then she said this.`
`"Because it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`"......Huh?`
` A... a curse?"`
`It took some time before I understood what Rena meant by that.`
`Mion clicked her tongue and shook her head a little.`
`"Satoshi talked to me before he disappeared.`
` ...He said someone was watching him.`
` Stalking him.`
` They even followed him home. `
`He told me that when he went to bed, they were standing there at his bedside, looking down at him."`
`"...Stop it, Rena."`
`"It's a portent of Oyashiro-sama's curse—there's no doubt.`
` I think, somewhere deep down, Satoshi-kun was probably thinking about abandoning Hinamizawa and running away. `
`...And Oyashiro-sama wouldn't allow that."`
`"...I said, stop it..."`
`"Oyashiro-sama is the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.`
` He would never allow anyone to abandon Hinamizawa and run away.`
` I apologized for it!`
` But Satoshi-kun probably didn't. `
`It must have been!`
` It must have been Oyashiro-sama's curse!!"`
`"...Oyashiro-sama's... curse...?"`
`I hadn't intended to repeat it.`
`...But the words came out of my mouth anyway.`
` ...Oyashiro-sama's... curse.`
`"The police may have said he ran away, but I don't believe it! I won't believe it, not ever!`
`It's just a lie told by the self-important people in the village who don't want to admit it was the curse!`
`And whether or not you believe in Oyashiro-sama's curse, it's—"`
`Wham!`
`...Mion struck Rena in the head.`
`And not in a joking way, either.`
`"I told you to give it a rest, didn't I?!`
` I try to be nice, but you're pushing me to my limits!!"`
`Pushing her to her limits... Actually, there was plenty of displeasure and anger in Mion's face at that moment.`
`...For a few moments after being hit, Rena looked astonished.`
`...Perhaps the voices of the higurashi calmed her frantic mind—because after a little while, she regained her original calm expression...`
`We arrived at the place we always split up with Mion.`
`...No one said a word until we got there.`
`...The voices of the higurashi just tortured our ears with their buzzing.`
`"..............."`
`We'd always split up with Mion here, leaving just Rena and me.`
`"Hey, Kei-chan.`
` Didn't I promise to lend you some manga?`
` Want to come over real quick?"`
`...Huh?`
`She promised that?`
`However, I quickly realized it was a convenient way of saying she wanted to talk to me alone.`
`"...Oh, I see.`
` ...Okay, then Rena will go home."`
`Maybe she realized it—maybe she didn't.`
`...Thankfully, Rena quickly said she'd go home before us.`
`"Bye, Rena.`
` See you tomorrow."`
`"Yep.`
` See you tomorrow!`
` Keiichi-kun, don't be too much of a bother, now.`
` It's already evening."`
`"I'm just going to borrow a few books.`
` ...See ya."`
`Considering the fun day we had... it was a very insipid, lonely parting.`
`"Hey... Don't worry too much about before."`
`After a little while, Mion finally spoke.`
`...Quite some time had passed since splitting up with Rena.`
`"No, I'm not, really...`
` ......I think it was my fault anyway."`
`"...We weren't... trying to hide anything about Satoshi.`
` ...It's just... one of those things that we shouldn't mention, you know?"`
`At this point, I understood exactly what she meant by that.`
`...Judging by our odd interactions with Rena, I understood so well it hurt—that I shouldn't ever talk about it again.`
` Actually... if that's the case, then with Shion, too...`
`.........No, this is a bigger problem.`
`...Talking about it in the first place had been indiscreet.`
` ...I shouldn't have been interested in it at all.`
`But that's why I really had to think about it.`
`...About why everyone got so irritated...`
` (Idiot! Stop this, Keiichi Maebara!!)`
`...By the time I'd tried to warn myself, I had accidentally spoken already.`
`"I won't ask ever again.`
` So could you tell me honestly?`
` ...What on earth...`
` happened to Satoshi?`
` ...He ran away, right?"`
`"....................."`
`For a long time, Mion remained silent... but finally, unable to endure it any longer, she began to speak timidly...`
`"Have you ever heard about... Oyashiro-sama's curse?"`
`"...Just a little bit."`
`...I got the gist of it.`
`I only overheard someone in class talking about it, though.`
`Oyashiro-sama was the name of the deity protecting Hinamizawa, that they worship at the shrine we had the barbecue at today.`
`...And a few years ago, when they started talking about flooding Hinamizawa as part of the dam project... `
`One of the people worked on site died or something, and people blamed it on Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ...That's how it was.`
`"Satoshi's dead parents...`
` They were proponents of the dam project."`
`"Huh... Wasn't everyone in the village against it?`
` Why would they support the project if they lived here...?"`
`The dam project, that would flood the entirety of Hinamizawa.`
`...I'd heard the village all got together to fight the terrible project... but it was a little hard to believe there were villagers who were supporting it.`
`"...Well... there was a lot of stuff going on.`
` But not everyone agreed to stand up to the dam proposal.`
` ...Satoshi's parents were basically the leaders of those who were all for it."`
`"Leaders of the ones for it... Satoko and Satoshi's parents?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...The government had gathered a lot of compensation money to exchange for the construction of the dam.`
` There were plenty of people who agreed with the proposal because they wanted the money."`
`"............"`
`Aside from a few households, Hinamizawa was, in general, not very affluent.`
`And not because they were proud to inherit the land of their ancestors.`
`It wouldn't be strange if some people wanted enough money to start a new life.`
`...But even in that case, they would have had to hesitate to say so, given the situation.`
`It just happened to be Satoko and Satoshi's parents... who understood that and stood up to be their representative.`
`By that standard, you might say Satoko and Satoshi's parents were very heroic.`
`...They volunteered to be hated, all to help those without much money who didn't have a voice.`
`"And then.`
` ...Their parents had bad luck.`
` ...They died in an accident on the day of the festival honoring Oyashiro-sama.`
` ...So people started to think that maybe it had been Oyashiro-sama's curse..."`
`...I thought back to what Coach told me today.`
`...They went to a nature park on a family outing... and fell from a cliff...`
`"...So... people thought even Satoshi running away from home was because of Oyashiro-sama's curse...?"`
`".........Well... yeah.`
` ...Basically."`
`It was a bit of an evasive reply, but I felt it was wrong to ask any further, so I didn't press her for details.`
`"...I don't think I need to explain this, but...`
` for Satoko, her parents' accident and Satoshi running away...`
` and all the business about Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` None of it's a very happy story, you know?"`
`...Yeah, of course I knew.`
`...I could only nod silently.`
`"That's why... we're not mentioning anything about Satoko's family.`
` ...Even if someone asks about Satoshi, we just lie and said he transferred schools.`
` ...You can understand why, right?"`
`...They wanted to protect Satoko's happiness—her smile.`
`...As someone who thought that way once, even for a short time...`
` I really did regret having been imprudent enough to broach the topic to begin with...`
`"............Yeah.`
` I get it.`
` I'm sorry I asked something so careless."`
`When she heard that, Mion smiled, seeming a little relieved.`
`With that understanding, thinking that I should get going, I began to make my way home.`
`...I could really have stopped by Mion's house, but it was already late.`
`I'd stop by again the next time I had the chance.`
`"Bye then, Mion.`
` Sorry about today.`
` ...See you tomorrow."`
`"Yeah.`
` Good-bye."`
`We waved to each other.`
`...Then, suddenly remembering something, Mion called out to me.`
`"Kei-chan!`
` ...One more thing...`
` ...Not only around Satoko, could you keep quiet about Satoshi with Rena, too?"`
`"............Huh?"`
`"...I think you realized earlier, but...`
` For some reason, when it comes to Oyashiro-sama's curse... she gets extremely serious.`
` ...Ever since she transferred here."`
`".................."`
`Yeah, judging by how Rena was acting earlier... it was clearly no laughing matter to her.`
`...Mion had interrupted the conversation for us...`
` But if Mion hadn't been here... what might have happened...?`
`"...Why would Rena... be so serious about it?"`
`Not only Rena, either—but Shion too.`
`"...I don't know.`
` Rena is—oh, this is a secret, okay?`
` If you tell anyone, we're not friends anymore."`
`Mion emphasized this as her expression clouded even further.`
`"I won't tell...`
` What's this about Rena?"`
`"...She says she's been a victim of Oyashiro-sama's curse before."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"I... well, it may sound mean, but I think it might be a bad case of a persecution complex, or some kind of wrong assumption.`
` But she says so herself, so I believe her. `
`...If I poke fun at it, she gets pretty upset.`
` ...Rena jokes around all the time...`
` but she's really scary when she's mad."`
`"...I get it.`
` Don't talk about it in front of Rena, right?`
` About Satoshi."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If possible, I think we shouldn't talk about this ever again.`
` For her sake.`
` ...And for Satoko's."`
`For everyone else's, too.`
`...And if I must say, for your own sake too, Kei-chan.`
`...With her silence, Mion made sure I knew that.`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...Okay.`
` I got it."`
`"Thanks."`
`Saying only that, she waved her hand, and began walking away.`
`...I watched her go, a little dazed, and then started walking myself.`
`......Satoko's older brother, Satoshi.`
`Had he run away from home?`
`...Or had he been a victim of the curse and disappeared forever?`
`......Whichever the case, none of this was anything I should have asked about...`
`...The cooling air forced me into self-reflection.`
`......I wanted Satoko to smile...`
`Yet, my curiosity easily defeated me, and I frivolously tried to step into the dark side of things in a joking way...`
` ...I'm shameful.`
`I wanted today to be exactly like yesterday.`
`I wanted tomorrow to be just as fun as today, too.`
`...So why did I go and do something like that...`
`We were having a blast at the baseball game yesterday.`
`And today we had a blast at the big barbecue party, too.`
`It was a lot of fun.`
`...But then I went...`
` ...I went and almost nullified all of those fun times.`
`...I would have to be more careful starting tomorrow.`
`I would put all this unpleasant stuff behind me forever.`
`...Like hell I'm gonna let my enjoyable life end because of how careless I was today...`
`But the more I thought that I'd be more careful starting tomorrow...`
`The more I couldn't get rid of the ominous thought that I had already put an end to those enjoyable days with what I'd just done.`
`.....................`
`...............Hey, wait.`
`...Calm down, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...The gears of destiny are freaking gigantic, aren't they?`
`What happened just now was trivial.`
` ...It doesn't make any sense to think my life will be totally different starting tomorrow.`
`...But even though I understood it logically...`
` the mist in my heart wasn't going to fade... until tomorrow turned out to be as fun as today.`
`"...I'm acting weird.`
` ...I'm thinking a little too much... about that conversation..."`
`I wished tomorrow would come already.`
`I wanted it to make me understand how absurd my insignificant doubts really were.`
`...The night was long.`
