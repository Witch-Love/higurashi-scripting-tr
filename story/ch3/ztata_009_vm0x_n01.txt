`"Good evening, Keiichi-kun.`
` Didn't think we would meet here."`
`"Tomitake-san?"`
`Tomitake-san was good humored as usual, smiling all the way through.`
`"Hm, I'm really glad the weather is looking so good today.`
` The weather forecast said that a cold front is coming very soon, but it still looks fine here."`
`"Yeah.`
` But looks like the rainy season isn't over yet."`
`"Yep, I was planning to go out tomorrow but...`
` I guess it's not a bad idea to make some changes to my plan."`
`"Let's leave it at that, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...If it's true, then I can't leave it alone."`
`"I'd contact the Okinomiya child consultation center.`
` You said just now that I would be turned away, didn't you? `
`Child welfare officers can bring the police with them if the situation demands.`
` They will not submit to intimidation."`
