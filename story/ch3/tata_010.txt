`"G'morning, Keiichi-kun!"`
`"Morning."`
`"Thank goodness.`
` I thought you overslept today too!`
` Your mom said you'd gone on ahead yesterday, and then you weren't at school.`
` I was worried that you had gotten heat stroke halfway there!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry for all the worry I caused you yesterday."`
`"Heeey, goood morning!"`
`"Mii-chan, good morning~!`
`"They only called it that—it was more like a party.`
` We have the festival every year, right?`
` We wouldn't have any annoying meetings at this point."`
`"Are you going to help out with the festival this afternoon then?"`
`"Yep.`
` I have to do a meet-and-greet with all sorts of people in Grandma's place.`
` Besides, they already started setting up for the festival!"`
`Our morning conversation was lighthearted as usual.`
`...It looked like Mion had thankfully forgotten... about how I'd barged into her house yesterday with that crazy talk.`
`...The more I think back on it, I felt like I'd really said something terrible to her.`
` ...I was really thoughtless, and it wouldn't have been weird if she'd yelled at me.`
`It was highly possible Takano-san had exaggerated her story.`
`...To think that our comrade and friend, Mion,`
`the young leader of the Sonozakis, one of the Three Families effectively controlling Hinamizawa, was pulling the strings behind the serial death incidents... was a little unbelievable.`
`...But... if there was even a one percent chance... that it was true...`
`...Then what I said yesterday to Mion... might have been a success.`
`Yes, it was no more than one in a hundred.`
`...But that little bit of effort might have brought the chances of saving Satoko up by even a tiny bit.`
`......At least I'd made that effort.`
`...After yesterday ended, I was sure I'd done everything I possibly could.`
`...If there was something else I could do... it was probably just to clap my hands and pray that Satoko's uncle would be killed by the curse...`
`"...I hope Satoko makes it today."`
`"...Me too.`
` ...Sensei is doing things for her, right?`
` Mm.`
` ...I'm sure it'll be fine."`
`"My aunt is a welfare agent in the Hinamizawa district...`
` I gave her a call last night."`
`"Huh, I didn't know your aunt was a welfare officer.`
` ...What happened?`
` Did you tell her about Satoko-chan?"`
`"Yep.`
` Chie-sensei called the child consultation center right after we talked to her.`
` A child welfare officer apparently visited before the night was over. `
`My aunt said that they were going to pay visits at regular intervals from now on."`
`"...Enough with the dumb, little stuff.`
` I want to know what happened to Satoko.`
` Did they get her safe?!"`
`"Mm...`
` My aunt wasn't that informed about it.`
` ...I was supposed to keep this a secret anyway.`
` Her telling me was a big breach of ethics in the first place."`
`".........Damn, that makes me feel even worse."`
`"...Let's... get to school."`
`Right.`
`Discussing this more would just make us feel worse.`
`...It was far quicker to go to school and see if Satoko was safe or not.`
`The three of us nodded... and ran off.`
`...Was Satoko safe?`
`What measures had the child consultation center taken?`
`I didn't care what—as long as we could go back to our peaceful life with Satoko today, it didn't matter to me.`
`At the shoe racks at the entrance, Rena took a peek in Satoko's shoe cubby.`
`"Ah... Satoko's shoes are here! They're here!`
`Kei-chan, Satoko came.`
` Thank goodness...!"`
`"We don't know if anything happened just because she came to school.`
` We can't know anything... until we see her face!"`
`We trotted towards the classroom.`
`The classroom... was lively, as it usually was in the morning.`
`"...Satoko...!!`
` Where are you...?!"`
`"...Meep.`
` She's right here."`
`"It's too early in the morning to be so loud.`
` Would you please keep it down a bit?"`
`"Satoko-chan!`
` ...Umm... Are you okay?"`
`All of our friends crowded around Satoko excitedly.`
`"...A probation officer came, right?`
` ...Umm... How did it go?"`
`"...Who was it that called them?`
` I swear... It was quite a mess, you know."`
`"It was the teacher.`
` ......You were absent for so long, of course she was worried."`
`...Satoko said "I told you I'm fine" under her breath.`
`She was still... trying to overcome all the suffering on her own.`
`"...It was a big bother to both me and my uncle.`
` That person just barged on in on us suddenly, geez..."`
`"Everyone was worried about you, Satoko.`
` Don't say it was a bother..."`
`"Ahh, geez!!`
` Anyway!`
` What happened?!"`
`"Nothing happened.`
` Ho-ho-ho—my cold got better, so I came back to school, that's all.`
` I can't take too much time off from now on because then you'll all worry about me.`
` ...Ho-ho-ho."`
`...What... was Satoko saying...?`
`"What happened to, well... your uncle?"`
`"Oh, he admitted there were some misunderstandings, and we both apologized."`
`Tug.`
`...Rika-chan grabbed the back of my collar and pulled me away.`
`"...W-What is it, Rika-chan?"`
`Rika-chan silently dragged me all the way into the hallway.`
`"......Rika-chan... What... did that mean?!"`
`"...Satoko... said nothing was happening and chased them away."`
`.........Id—`
`"...That idiot...!!!`
` But... but why...?!"`
`No... Somewhere in my mind... I thought it might turn out like this.`
`Satoko didn't... ask for anyone's help, she didn't hide behind anyone... She was trying to ride out this pain.`
`...She wanted to show Satoshi proof that if he came back to them, she wouldn't need to hide behind him anymore.`
`"B-But... Coach said probation officers can bring her to safety in an emergency even if it's against her wishes!`
` However much Satoko denies the abuse, it's a fact...!!"`
`...Chie-sensei finally came.`
` ...Her expression was far from cheerful.`
`"......Yes. You're right, Maebara-kun.`
` If the child welfare officer determines that it's an emergency, they have the right to immediately take them to safety.`
` Regardless of the affected party's intent."`
`"Then why?!`
` Why is Satoko's intent being respected so much—it's weird! Why don't they put her into safety?!"`
`"What the hell is that?!?`
` Sensei, didn't you say it was going to be all right, since you'd definitely save her?!`
` What's the meaning of this?!`
` This doesn't make any sense!!`
` Answer me, damn it!!"`
`".........Keiichi.`
` ...This is actually the third time someone has reported Satoko's child abuse.`
` ...It happened... twice in the past too."`
`"Furude-san...!"`
`Sensei tried to stop her, but Rika-chan went on speaking anyway.`
`"...Twice before?`
` ...I heard they decided to 'wait and see' after reporting it the winter before last... But it happened before then too?"`
`"...Satoko's father, who died, wasn't her real father."`
`"What...?`
` Rika-chan... that's... what?"`
`I'm stunned at the sudden revelation.`
`...I had no idea what Rika-chan wanted to tell me...`
` but it seemed really important... so I couldn't get a word in either.`
`"...Satoko's mother remarried.`
` She brought Satoko and Satoshi with her... so they weren't related by blood to their father."`
`Satoshi was a good kid... one who listened politely to what adults told him.`
`...He was immediately welcomed by their new father, and was loved.`
`But... Satoko was different.`
`She was rebellious, she told lies, she played pranks.`
` ...Her stepfather didn't like her at all.`
`"...What......`
` ...So... what do you mean...?"`
`"...Even before she was given to their uncle and his wife... Satoko didn't have a very good relationship with her family."`
`Of course, her stepfather didn't have any malicious intent at the start.`
`...At first, he must have worked hard to get his new daughter to accept him.`
`But... the young Satoko didn't make any effort at all towards that end.`
`She was distant towards her stepfather, and never opened her heart to him even a little.`
`...She just got on his nerves all the time... with seemingly-forced lies and pranks.`
`Her father's discipline and punishment must have been loving at first, of course... but that, too, faded quickly.`
`"......I don't know because I wasn't in Hinamizawa at the time...`
` But I learned this on the phone yesterday."`
`"...What story did you hear, Sensei?"`
`"...That Satoko-chan...`
` wanted to trick her parents...`
`"She made up a story... about hurting herself...?"`
`"...Satoko made a fake phone call... to try and get rid of the father she hated."`
`Child welfare officers rushed there and heard the story.`
`...Her father genuinely apologized for a few times when he had gone too far, and agreed to let the child welfare center give him coaching.`
`"......Related agencies looked into it quite a bit.`
` ......They determined that Satoko-chan and her stepfather's hearts not being quite matched up was the cause of the incident... `
`But they found another problem, above that, with Satoko-chan."`
`"A problem with Satoko... What was it?"`
`...Satoko's mother... there were a few times where she had lived with de facto husbands, though those relationships didn't result in remarriage.`
`...From a young age, Satoko had been forced to call at least two or three people her father.`
`At some point... Satoko's pranks escalated.`
`...She would spill food on purpose, turn over her plate... and even throw it.`
`She would break the windows in the neighborhood, and shoplift candy.`
`She would put thumb tacks everywhere, and set other traps to seriously hurt people.`
` ...Not in the way she did now, just to get laughs.`
`She was also fond of telling lies that would be found out right away... and people got mad at her every time.`
`...But she never, ever changed her behavior.`
`"......Please don't think Satoko-chan was a problem child.`
` ...Satoko-chan was young... Those were acts of self-defense... that she took so these unknown men wouldn't take her mother from her."`
`In regards to Satoko's problematic behavior, child psychology experts from public institutions... indicated her actions were to draw her mother's attention to herself.`
`They acknowledged that she had a form of harmful emotional trauma... and declared that she needed counseling and therapy from professionals.`
`They didn't know... whether that therapy had healed the wounds in her heart.`
`"...Satoko-chan purposely hurt herself...`
` and told them that she was being abused by her stepfather... in an attempt to chase him out."`
`"...But...`
` in the end...`
` her stepfather did abuse her, right?"`
`"No.`
` ...All of the abuse... had been made up by Satoko-chan.`
` ...Her stepfather, of course, may have scolded her in a somewhat emotional way... but it was nothing out of the ordinary."`
`Satoko... had lied to chase away her stepfather.`
`And... they saw through her right away...`
` and found out...`
` that Satoko had issues.`
`"...Oh......`
` Could it be...`
` that's why...`
` the winter before last... they decided to wait and see...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ......The child consultation center had all their past records...`
` so they needed to act carefully... in case Satoko was lying."`
`"...What the hell...`
` So... so what?`
` ...Satoko... might be telling a lie, so they needed to be careful.`
` ...So... how does that mean... they'd just end up... waiting and seeing?!"`
`"......It was the girl who cried wolf."`
`That fable... about telling a lie once... making others unwilling to believe you later.`
`"T-That's bullshit!!`
` The past has nothing to do with this, does it?!`
` Only what's really happening right now is important!!`
` Satoko is being abused by her uncle!! `
`Why is... Why is something that happened in the past getting in the way of helping her now?!"`
`...Neither Sensei nor Rika-chan had anything to say to that.`
`"...Anyway, yesterday, a probation officer visited to carefully determine what was going on."`
`And... Satoko dealt with them... put on the best, strongest smile she could manage, and denied the abuse.`
`Of course, she was probably being threatened to keep quiet about it by her uncle.`
`...Satoko was trying to outlast everything without asking for help...`
` Satoko wanted to wait for Satoshi to come back home...`
` And she outright denied the truth of the abuse...`
`...What an idiot...`
`......What...`
` ...You're not really enduring it...`
`Do you really think pretending like this... will actually bring Satoshi back...?`
`Just stop it already.`
`...Satoshi, he... he abandoned you.`
`...And the fact that he hasn't shown up to save you now is proof, isn't it?`
`...So just stop it.`
` ...Please stop being weird and pretending to endure it...`
`".........Forget everything we just said.`
` Understand?`
` If you tell anyone else, your teacher will be very mad with you!"`
`Chie-sensei gave me a warning then left to go back to the teacher's lounge...`
`"...Keiichi.`
` Please don't think Satoko is a pathetic, pitiful girl."`
`"............"`
`"...She's living life.`
` ...She's—"`
`"I know that!! She's our irreplaceable friend!"`
`"......Satoko is still trying her best.`
` ...Let's watch over her... a little longer... `
`The person from the consultation center said they'd visit periodically from now on.`
` ...If something terrible happens, they'll help her right away..."`
`".........Yeah, but only after it happens."`
`Any more than that would have sounded like I was picking a fight... so I firmly swallowed my next words and went back to the classroom.`
`Mion and Rena were talking to Satoko like they always did.`
`...It was a silly conversation.`
`A humorous, even fun one, like it was any old day.`
`...If... If Satoko really said she could still endure it...`
` then maybe I should do as Rika-chan said and watch over her.`
`...Maybe whatever help I offer will just go unwanted.`
