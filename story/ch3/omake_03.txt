`"Thank you very much for enjoying Higurashi: When They Cry - Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi.`
` How did you like it? It had a different sort of atmosphere than the previous chapters.`
` I would be happy if you enjoyed it☆."`
`"Hee-hee!`
` A bad end again, the type which we're so fond of, huh?☆ `
`"Of course I do not think so!!`
` Again!`
` It happened again!!"`
`"A huuuuge bad end!!`
` Ku-ku-ku!`
` Ah-ha-ha!!"`
`"Huuuh?`
` Mii-chan, you sure seem happy about the bad end."`
`"Well, it's more like all we can honestly do at this point is laugh."`
`"Nah-ha-ha.`
` The terrible endings have been escalating through each chapter, and it finally reached a culmination, I suppose."`
`"...Everyone died together as friends.`
` As friends, nipah~☆."`
`"Hmm, I guess you could say that!`
` I die every time though, and I'm a little tired of it!`
` It would be nice to have an ending where I didn't die once in a while."`
`"Tomitake-san, you're kind of like a time signal!`
` When you die, it's like, oh, we're in the second half now!`
` Kind of~!"`
`"""Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"""`
`"Okay!`
` Everyone give a big round of applause~!!`
` First is Coach—Irie Kyousuke-san~~!"`
`"I'm honored to have your introduction.`
` Hello there.`
` I was a minor character, but having a full portrait like this makes me really feel important."`
`"It's true!`
`"Hahahaha☆.`
`"Thank you very much!`
`"Hello there, everyone!`
`"...Ah, haha, hahahahaha!`
` Oh, someone give Chie-sensei a seat, please~!"`
`"Okay!`
` Now everybody is here!`
` Rena!`
` You can do the honors again!"`
`"Okay, everyone~!`
` Please pick up the cup nearest to you on your table~!`
` There are plenty of different drinks~!"`
`"These afterparties have really gotten lively.`
` How many do we have here now?"`
`"Including us, I think there are about ten people."`
`"Now we finally have the same number of minors and adults!`
` We can all drink without being ashamed!"`
`"Speaking of beer—how is it that something so delicious when cold turns so bad when warm?`
` One of the seven wonders of the world, I say."`
`"Hee-hee-hee!`
` I wonder why?"`
`"Okay, I'll pour some beer.`
` One,`
` two,`
` three,`
` four,`
` five,`
` six.`
` ...Huh?`
` There were six adults here?"`
`"...Meep♪`
` I would like the foamy barley tea as well."`
`"Rika-chan, you can't drink!!"`
`"Anyway, Rena-san, let's get this moving."`
`"Well, okay!`
` Can I have everyone's attention please~~!!"`
`"All right, everyone!`
` Excellent work on the Tatarigoroshi chapter!!`
` Cheers~~!!!"`
`"""Cheers~~~!!!!"""`
`Yaaaay!!! Clap clap clap clap clap clap!!`
`"Okay then.`
` Let's get down to our traditional plot discussion!"`
`"Still, though... This chapter just confused us yet again.`
` ...Hmm, well, if anyone has an opinion, please raise your hand!"`
`"............Wow, everyone's being so discreet.`
` No hands?"`
`"...Then why don't I break the ice?`
` Oh, excuse me, could you change the music please?`
` To something a little more mysterious.`
` ......Yeah, that's good."`
`"...The mood has been set."`
`"All right... Takano-san, take it away!"`
`"I think that just by poring over the Tatarigoroshi story, the mystery won't be revealed."`
`"...I know what you mean.`
` Obviously that's how the stories have been set up."`
`"...Was there something like that in particular?"`
`"I don't know if I'm right...`
` But in Onikakushi, when Maebara-kun was eating in the restaurant with Ooishi-san, Sonozaki-san found out, and it was a little mysterious, right?"`
`"It was certainly mysterious just in Onikakushi, but after reading Watanagashi a few things made a lot of sense."`
`"Someone who knew Kei-chan was there too, and told me... It actually makes a good amount of sense, right?`
` That's what we mean."`
`"There are subtle differences in the Higurashi stories,`
` but I think there are three facets that are the same for each.`
` The character settings, for example."`
`"I agree with the characters being exactly the same.`
` ...The most extreme case being me dying in the same way in the same place every time."`
`"...No matter which story it is, you always die on the same day."`
`"There's a scene where during Watanagashi, Takano-san and Tomitake-san sneak into the ritual implement storehouse. `
`...The same scene may have still happened in the other stories, even though it wasn't portrayed."`
`"I think it still happened.`
` ...Save for a few events—the weather the day of the festival, what we did in the club, and Satoko's uncle coming home—it's almost all the same."`
`"...Which means...... we have a bunch more questions.`
` If the stories are told in exactly the same environment each time, why do they end up being so different?"`
`"...An unavoidable bad end from a choice so early on... That's pretty scary!"`
`"I think it was way before that.`
`"...Then what was the first branch in Onikakushi?"`
`"I think... it was when I appeared and started talking about the serial freak death incidents related to Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`"...You know, I just thought of something.`
`"...I see...`
` Satoko's gotten right to the point.`
` You're right!`
` You can say that again!"`
`"Then maybe we should pray Ooishi-san and her uncle don't show up in this dark story,`
` and then if we can prevent Sonozaki-san from getting in a bad mood, everyone will be happy?"`
`"Yaaay, Big Sis, you're needed for the bad ending~!!`
` Be careful, everyone~!`
` If you make my sister mad, you're sure to get a bad end~!!"`
`"W-What are you saying?!`
` Shioooonnn!!`
` Just you waaaaait!!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` ...We can't solve any of the mysteries thus far, but we seem to have put together a plan for how to get the story to end happily."`
`"......I wonder... if that would really make us happy.`
` Ooishi-san and Teppei Houjou-san don't show up.`
` Mion-san gets the doll.`
` ...Is that all we have to make sure of?"`
`"You're right.`
` ...We're all forgetting the most important thing.`
` Remember the Great Hinamizawa Disaster?"`
`"You cannot prevent natural disasters!!`
` Should we have everyone in the village put on gas masks and move away?!"`
`"...It's probably Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` So we need to make sure not to make Oyashiro-sama angry."`
`"Nah-ha-ha!`
` This is getting a little tricky.`
` We mustn't anger Oyashiro-sama, eh?`
` And what should we do in order to prevent that?"`
`"The dam project itself is probably out of the question...`
` Maybe if there was never a dam project in the first place?"`
`"That... would be hard.`
` ...If it didn't happen, we would need a ritual to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger."`
`"Come on, use your head!`
` If he's gonna die anyway, then we may as well have it help out Hinamizawa!"`
`"I knew all along... I knew you had some very important role in this story, Jirou-san.`
` We'll get you to play your part☆."`
`"And with that... we have a blueprint for getting a nice, happy, good ending, don't we?`
` Let's give it a try since we have time.`
` Everyone involved, come over here!"`
`First... we stop Uncle Houjou, whose lover ran out on him, from returning to Hinamizawa!`
` Why don't I take my motorbike back?`
` I'll just put in the key, and click.`
` ...Click?"`
`Kabooooooooooooooooom!!!!`
`"Judgment!!!`
` To ashes and dust shall you return!!!"`
`"S-Satoko-chan, don't you think this was a little too much gunpowder...?"`
` (I hope Coach is all right... (sweat)).`
`Next we stop Ooishi from showing up!!`
`"Me this time?`
` Nfu-fu!`
` My name is Kuraudo Ooishi☆.`
` A hot, good-looking middle-aged man who looks like a blues singer.`
` Mfu-fu-fu!"`
`Kabooooooooooooooooom!!!!`
`"...Meep!`
` Judgment for you."`
`"And, lest we forget, a follow-up service for my sister!`
` Come here, Big Sis!`
` There's a cute little doll for you~☆.`
` Aww, how nice~!"`
`"Mgh, something about this just doesn't sit right with me!!!"`
`"And finally... we must quell Oyashiro-sama's anger."`
`"Then... will our last actor please come up?"`
`"Tie him fast, wrap him up, and hang him!`
` He'll sink for three days, right?"`
`"I'm not that patient—let's just get it over with~!"`
`"Gbbrhgghnbhgrhbgh!!!!"`
`"And with that!! The case has been closed!!!"`
`"Ahahahahaha... Hmm☆.`
`"...This pile of corpses is a pretty big deal."`
`"Huh?`
` It's the phone.`
` ......Hello?`
` Oh, Keiichi-kun?!`
` Thanks for all your work!"`
`"Yeah, yeah! Looks like you're all having a roaring old time.`
` And yet here I am busy with reading the scenario for the next story!!`
` Whatever.`
` I'm in a good mood today, so I'll let you off without any teasing. `
`...Is Shion there?`
`"What?`
` You're going to announce it here?`
`"A secret between Shion-san and Keiichi-san?!"`
`"Wha-Wha-Wha-What do you meeeeean?!`
` Nobody told me about this! Nobody!!"`
`"""W-Whaaaaaaat?!?!"""`
`"...Yes, so that's that.`
` The one topping the popularity charts since her first appearance.`
`"I have no idea what that means, and it doesn't matter.`
`"...Are you okay with this, Shion-san?`
` The main character always meets some terrible fate in the end!"`
`"Ku-ku-ku!`
` Well, until now.`
` But that doesn't necessarily mean it'll happen next time!"`
`"That means it'll be a thrilling story where I become a detective and solve all these crazy, unfair mysteries.`
` You'd all better think up good signature phrases!`
` Like...`
` 'You, sir, are the criminal'☆."`
`"It won't happen, never!!`
`"Sis, I should say the same to you—are you mentally prepared for me to see through all your mysteries and secrets, then have you apologize to me and commit suicide?"`
`"...No chance of Oyashiro-sama's curse for me, is there?"`
`"Anyway.`
` The new story to begin the second half, temporarily called Meakashi, or 'eye-opening,' is currently undergoing diligent development. `
`We should be able to unveil it to you all in the near future, so I hope you'll look forward to it."`
`"......Onikakushi,`
` Watanagashi,`
` and Tatarigoroshi.`
` What truths will you all come up with after reading these three stories?`
` ...Or will you just come up with more questions instead of theories? `
`Hmmm, ahahaha.`
` Rena has no clue either.`
` Ahahaha..."`
`"For all of you warriors who never yielded to these three mysteries and kept on fighting... `
`we present you with one final scenario as thanks for your enthusiasm, one which we never originally planned on giving to you.`
` Please enjoy it."`
