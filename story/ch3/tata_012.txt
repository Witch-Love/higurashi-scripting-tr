`............At first, I thought it was a dream.`
`...I was staring at this strange sheet... not really understanding what it was.`
`...That was all.`
` I didn't go after it, nor did I ridicule it.`
`The fact was that the boring view was the ceiling of my own room... but I didn't realize that for a fairly long time.`
`...Yes.`
` ...I thought I had been dreaming... but I had actually been staring at the ceiling... the whole time.`
`Lethargy induced by the voices of the cicadas.`
`...Even after I realized I was awake, I couldn't draw forth the energy to sit up...`
`......Everything I could see, everything I could hear—everything was like a television broadcast that had already ended.`
`...It was hot.`
`...So hot I could choke on the heat.`
`...My back was moist with night sweats... and it felt gross.`
`...Unable to endure it any longer, I tossed in my futon... and finally, blood started coursing through my brain...`
`I lazily recalled... the long day... I had yesterday.`
`The reality... as I lay here listening to the voices of the cicadas... and yesterday, so different from it.`
`...In order to kill Satoko's uncle... I had rehearsed, formulated a plan... and dug a hole.`
`...It was... very hot, and I was tired, wasn't I...?`
`...And when evening came... I went to school and called him out on the phone.`
`...I panicked for a moment when he asked where the police station was... but it worked out.`
`...And then I awaited him... and swooped down.`
`...I couldn't remember anymore what sort of emotions I'd let control my body.`
`...In any case... it didn't go smoothly...... but I did it.`
`...It was very hard to dig the hole for the body.`
`...That feel of the rain pelting down on me... I don't think I'll ever forget it.`
`...The rain, the mud, and the sprays of blood.`
` ...The sensation of floundering in a swamp.`
`......When I met Takano-san on the way home... that wasn't good, no matter how I interpreted it.`
`...It was the most misfortunate and uncalculated thing that had happened that night.`
`Everything would have been perfect... if only I hadn't encountered her.`
`...............Haa...`
`I was just riding my bike, with my shovel in one hand, through the downpour, utterly soaked.`
`......There was no way someone could surmise I was a murderer burying a body just from that information.`
`...Now that I was thinking calmly, napping under the morning sun, that's what I thought.`
`Still... the more I think about Takano-san's eyes...`
` ...It seemed like she understood.`
`...Takano-san... s h e   k n e w.`
`...That I'd killed someone...`
` buried them...`
` and that I'd been on my way home,`
` exhausted.`
`...Takano-san wouldn't gain anything from selling me out to the police.`
`...But that didn't mean I could feel at ease.`
`"......I should... have killed her........."`
`I had crossed such a bridge... to get my tranquil life back...`
`And I'd finally achieved it as a result...`
`...But now, for the rest of my life... for all the tranquil days starting today... I'd have to live in fear of when they could suddenly end.`
`I may have twisted my ankle, dulled from total exhaustion...`
` The fact that I couldn't make the snap judgment I needed to... I regretted it more and more as time went on...`
`...You didn't have a choice, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...You didn't have any choice at the time.`
`You were tired.`
`You were a mess.`
`...Even if you had made the decision... you might not have even been able to kill her.`
`...She might have just beaten you instead.`
`In that sense, parting ways uneventfully could have been the safer option.`
`...No matter how sharp Takano-san's intuition was, she had no proof.`
`...Her suspecting me didn't amount to evidence by itself.`
`".........Logically, I know that.`
` ...But... that doesn't mean I have nothing to worry about, does it...?"`
`...Just worry about it when the time comes.`
` ...Now isn't the time to be worrying.`
` ...It's the time to be smiling, right?`
`You accomplished so much, just to gain a new life starting today, didn't you?`
`...Then you should be happy at this new morning.`
`...If remembering the past is too hard for you... then just consider everything up to yesterday as having never happened.`
`You said so yourself.`
`...You'd bury it all like it never happened.`
`Well, your wish came true.`
`Everything before yesterday never happened.`
`...So be happy, Keiichi Maebara.`
`"............Yay."`
`I stuck up my hands lazily.`
`...It felt a little silly for me to be the one doing it.`
`I heaved a sigh from deep in my belly.`
`...That sigh got my lungs moving.`
`It felt like I hadn't been breathing until just now.`
`...It wasn't enough to admonish myself over.`
`All the dice that could be thrown already had been.`
`...And the numbers that turned up... weren't bad at all.`
`...If I lost with those numbers... then I'd just have to give up, I guess.`
`...I grabbed the chest of my pajamas and flapped it back and forth.`
`...Cool air flowed over my sweating body.`
`Okay.`
` ...Nothing before yesterday... happened.`
`Nothing.`
` Nothing at all.`
`...I'd forget it all. Yesterday was all a dream!`
`What time was it?`
` ...About midday?`
`...Getting myself up and going to school this late seemed kind of absurd.`
`...But I needed to go.`
`I felt like going to school would be the first step into my peaceful new life.`
`...I didn't care how late it was; I would go.`
`...I'd go to school right now and get back to the life I had retaken as soon as I could.`
`My lazy body immediately became lighter at the thought.`
`I rolled up out of the futon, bounced onto my knees, then leaped upright.`
`"Nice. Stuck the landing!"`
`I stuck out my chest with pride at my gymnast-like pose, then took a deep breath of fresh air.`
`...The brisk morning air had been gone for a while, replaced by the crisp air of summer.`
`Downstairs, I got a stern talking to by my mother—where were you last night? When did you get back? You need to tell me when you won't be home for dinner—things like that.`
`...But considering the importance of what I'd accomplished yesterday, a little scolding was no problem.`
`...In fact, it even felt like the sort of thing that would happen in such a peaceful life.`
`I listened with an irresponsible smile... and stepped out into the sun high overhead.`
`It was around the time lunch break would be ending.`
`...Everyone... would probably be worrying about me.`
`I didn't go to the festival, and now I wasn't at school.`
`...Well... Maybe they weren't too worried about it.`
`Since... they would have gotten a small piece of news, but a happy one, from Satoko today.`
`...Yes, the small piece of news... that her uncle hadn't come home last night.`
`Satoko would probably live her days in nervous tension for a while... thinking he might still come home.`
`...But eventually, those days would end.`
`And finally, Satoko, too... would realize her uncle was never coming back.`
`And then... Rika-chan would quietly invite her.`
`...She would say, "you can live with me again."`
`And everything would be back to normal.`
`...Our lives would go back to how they were before that man appeared.`
`Satoko would start wearing that extraordinary smile, complete with those protruding canines... and fool everyone with those traps she was so proud of.`
`...I'd probably be her first target out of everyone... but I wouldn't be mad.`
`In fact, I might actually shed tears of joy at the return of something so normal.`
`Satoko... She'd gradually grow back into that meddlesome personality of hers.`
`...I mean, my lack of useful life skills was already completely exposed.`
`...I wondered if I'd ever be a match for Satoko.`
`...But that would be such a pleasant thing to see too.`
`And with such warm, fuzzy predictions... I didn't feel bad for going to school so late.`
`...In fact, I wanted to run there now to get there as soon as I could.`
`Instead, I decided to savor the peacefulness of just going to school like normal, without running.`
`...The world I'd obtained for myself... that gave me joy just by walking like this.`
`Yes.`
` ...The world beginning on this very day was something I had won.`
`Without that monumental feat yesterday, I would never have been able to come to school so cheerfully today.`
`...The school gate came into sight.`
`Just then, I heard the principal ringing the bell to mark the end of lunch break.`
`It was a clear, refreshing sound.`
`...I stopped despite myself... and let myself take it in.`
`...Tap.`
`I had stopped suddenly.`
` ......So there was an extra footstep.`
`........................`
`With a noise... the blessedness I was feeling... throughout my whole body... withdrew into any pore it could find.`
`...And as if to replace it... I felt like... hundreds of hairy caterpillars were climbing up my feet.`
`I turned back, but of course, nobody was there.`
`...A single footstep could have easily been my imagination.`
`...But... the footstep... felt so ominous.`
`That extra footstep I had heard... after seeing Takano-san off last night.`
`With everything that happened on that insane night... I didn't mind something like that happening once.`
`...It had been a hell of a night, after all.`
`...In fact, having just one hallucination was pretty fortunate.`
`But... those footsteps should have ended with yesterday, so if I heard them again today...?`
`...There was really...`
`...`
`...`
` only one thing it could have meant.`
`...Last night still wasn't over.`
`...It was still going.`
`...Still.`
` That insane night—forever.`
`The step I heard.`
`Just that one extra footstep... was quietly, quietly ridiculing the nonsensical notion...`
` that the world starting today was completely different from the one that ended yesterday...`
`My classmates playing in the schoolyard all vanished inside like the tide going out.`
`...When I approached the school... it felt like that warm, fuzzy scene had ended... and it didn't feel good.`
`At the entrance... I took a quick look in everyone's shoe boxes.`
`...Satoko Houjou...`
` She was here.`
`...Mion was here too.`
` And Rena, of course.`
` ...Even Rika-chan was here.`
`...Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were here... In fact, I didn't see any missing classmates.`
`If there were shoes missing... they would have to be my own.`
`I took my shoes off and stuck them in... then took out some slippers.`
`There wasn't a single pair left in the shoe boxes anymore.`
`......With that, they returned to their rightful state.`
`...But as I stepped up onto the wooden floor... I noticed there was just one pair of slippers left.`
`...Huh...... Whose...?`
`".........Satoshi`
` ...Houjou..."`
`Satoshi, who had never been to school since... disappearing last year.`
`...Until now, we had committed the exact same act of violence... but I guess in the very end, it went differently.`
`You couldn't make it to school... but here I am.`
`I didn't repeat the same mistake you made.`
`...I wasn't about to let myself feel superior about that.`
`...In fact, I felt... an odd sense of familiarity with him.`
`...A misfortunate bond...`
` with someone I'd never met, due to following the same fate.`
`I headed down the hallway... towards the usual classroom.`
`It felt like... it had been a whole year since coming here.`
`.........Hey.`
` ...Did you forget, Keiichi Maebara?`
`...Satoshi Houjou... didn't really disappear on the night of Watanagashi, did he...?`
`"........................"`
`...Satoshi Houjou... disappeared a few days later.`
`...On Satoko's birthday, if I was right.`
`I didn't know what day it was...`
` but I couldn't say for sure I'd avoided Satoshi's failure... unless I remained here past that day.`
`...I was still... living in that night of insanity...`
`The teacher still hadn't come to the classroom.`
`The other door clattered open, the one the teacher wouldn't use, so everyone turned at once to see who had arrived.`
`...Everyone looked pretty vacant.`
` ...Mm.`
` Suppose I'll greet them.`
`"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.`
` I do thank you for coming all the way out here today.`
` Mfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`...Silence.`
`...When I started to think I'd fallen flat, someone finally started laughing for me.`
`"Ah-hahahahaha!`
` Good morning, Kei-chan.`
` You're pretty energetic today~!"`
`"Yeah, energetic!`
` Maybe you haven't gotten out of the festive mood yet. Hau!"`
`Hearing Mion and Rena's cheerful voices made me realize how dumb those dark feelings I'd been having at the entrance really were.`
`"...Hey, now... Festive mood? ...I wasn't..."`
`At the festival at all, remember?`
`...Before I could say that, Rika-chan smiled at me.`
`"...Keiichi, did you make sure to watch my dance?"`
`"Yep!`
` He saw it just fine.`
` Didn't you see how big an applause he gave you?"`
`"And he ignored it when that blockhead Shion came up and made a pass at him~!`
` Ah-ha-ha-ha!`
` Take that, Shion!`
` Wow, that felt good!"`
`...Mion starts laughing at the memory as she slaps me a few times on the back.`
`"So... How did that target practice contest turn out in the end?"`
`Tomita-kun was facing me and talking.`
`...There was nobody behind me.`
`...That meant he was talking to me...?`
`"...Tomitake turned up dead last.`
` Everyone had a good time with his punishment game."`
`"Ah-ha-ha-ha!`
` Weren't you supposed to be the one in last place, Rika-chan? `
`It was such a turnaround when you pulled off getting that chewing gum... I should have expected that from a member of my club!`
` It was fantastic!!"`
`"Crying at a time like that is a feat only Furude would be allowed to do!"`
` said Okamura-kun, breathing heavily from his nose.`
`...In my direction.`
`Everyone laughed—if anyone but Rika-chan had done it, it would have been against the rules.`
`...Rika-chan gave one of her nipah~ smiles as she listened to it.`
`...In my direction.`
`Rena, too, turned to me... no, turned towards me.`
`And then, with a somewhat embarrassed smile, she whispered to me so only I could hear.`
`"But really... thanks.`
` Keiichi-kun."`
`"............For what?"`
`"That giant stuffed animal.`
` ...I was really happy.`
` It's nice and safe right at my bedside.`
` ...And I made sure to give it a good night kiss before bed, too.`
` ...Hau~☆."`
`The class laughed at that, cheering and jeering.`
`...This whole time...`
` the conversation had been a little bit off...`
` I wasn't quite getting it.`
`"......What's this...`
` about a stuffed animal...?"`
`"What's this...?`
` Come on, we all worked really hard at the festival yesterday to get it down, remember?`
` The gigantic stuffed animal.`
`...The gigantic...`
` stuffed animal."`
`Rena seemed taken aback, but when she answered she did it with a smile.`
`"We were having a hard time knocking it over, so we tried aiming at the forehead, and rapid-fire shooting and stuff. `
`And then, Keiichi-kun, you got a whole bunch of guns ready beforehand and shot them all!`
` It was so cool... Hau~!"`
`...Wait...`
` Who was this?`
`"All the people in the neighborhood association, including the chairman, were praising you so much at the party afterwards. `
`One of them said he'd fallen in love with your way with words—Tokuzou Kimiyoshi, the chairman of the children's committee, I think? `
`He said he wanted you to entrust you with a few of the stalls at the next festival!"`
`"...Tokuzou is the chair of the refreshment booths. He's on the festival executive committee."`
`"Maebara-san is great at making things sound good, isn't he~!"`
`"Yep, whenever he talks about something, it seems a lot better than it actually is!"`
`"Ahahahahaha, you can't say that!`
` Ahahahahahaha...!"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you'd make a great salesman!`
` I bet you'd do great auctioning off overripe bananas or something~"`
`".........What have you been talking about?`
` ...I mean, I..."`
`...Didn't go to the festival in the first place.`
` ...I swallowed those words.`
`...I didn't know exactly why......`
` but in Hinamizawa...`
` this is what had happened.`
`...Yesterday, during the Watanagashi festival... "Keiichi Maebara" had appeared.`
`And he had romped about with all the usual members of his club.`
`He made a big scene at a few of the stalls, snatched a few sticks of takoyaki and okonomiyaki in his glee, rating each of them as delicious or terrible to get everyone excited.`
`And they'd seen a gigantic stuffed animal at the target practice game... and everyone went after it.`
`...And then I got a whole bunch of the cork guns, firing them in rapid succession, throwing each one away after using it,`
` and admirably,`
` I shot down the biggest stuffed animal there...`
`And then, I gave the stuffed animal, the proof of my victory, to Rena as a gift...`
`Then our fun came to a close as we had to go see Rika-chan's offertory dance.`
`There was a ton of people squeezed in there, and we all got separated, but we each managed to get into good positions to cheer Rika-chan on from.`
`Then, in the middle, when Shion came up and asked me to go hang out with her instead of watching the dedication dance,`
` I refused...`
` and stayed put, watching the dance until the very end...`
`...But who?`
` ...Who was that?`
`......Well, everyone's been saying it, haven't they?`
` ...Keiichi Maebara...`
`I had an urge to yell in anger at my classmates for having so much fun talking about the festival yesterday with "Keiichi Maebara."`
`...What the hell... are you guys even talking about?`
`Far stronger than that feeling, though... was the sheer uncanny nature of this reality I couldn't understand.`
`A "Keiichi Maebara" who wasn't me... was...`
` in Hinamizawa yesterday.`
`...As I threw away my humanity...`
` turned into a demon...`
` and was busy beating Satoko's uncle to death...`
` I was having a great time at the festival last night.`
`...What...`
` the hell?`
`...I had... to suffer through so much...`
` Desperately holding back tears...`
` getting so worn out... in that downpour...`
` digging holes, chasing, beating, killing,`
` dragging, and burying...`
`Who was this "Keiichi Maebara" who had ignored me so and spent such a fun, carefree time at the festival, damn it?!`
`Who the hell... stood in for me... as I put my life on the line working so hard to achieve this treasure-like everyday life?!`
`If there was another Keiichi Maebara besides me... then what was I?`
`...On the night of Watanagashi... where one died and one disappeared, in accordance with Oyashiro-sama's curse... there was only a demon... who had killed someone.`
`...Dumbfounded... as I succumbed to a horrifying possibility, I looked around at my classmates.`
`...To make sure... there was nobody extra I didn't recognize among them.`
`...To make sure... I wasn't among them.`
`...It was a horrifying thought...`
`That the real Keiichi Maebara hadn't overslept, and had come to school on time...`
`And that I, who was no longer Keiichi Maebara... had just waltzed in here...`
`...But... no matter how much I checked... the only people here were ones I knew.`
`...The man I met every time I looked in a bathroom mirror...`
` was not here.`
`"Okay, everyone!`
` Time to start afternoon classes!`
` Please take your seats.`
` President, please lead the class!"`
`The teacher entered and everyone hurried back to their seats.`
`...Upon finding me, who was so stupidly late, she gave me a stern talking to...... but I wasn't listening to it.`
`...Wasn't... our old life supposed to start today...?`
`...Something... wasn't right.`
` ...It was just strange.`
`I was supposed to go back to my old, fun life after yesterday.`
` ...I had set foot in an incomparably mysterious world... that was completely different from both my old life and my recent one.`
`Yes...`
` This was... without a doubt... a different world... than the one I'd been living in until now.`
`...There was no way such an absurd thing could be possible.`
`...But... unless it was true... I couldn't explain... anything that just happened.`
`In this classroom, I was surrounded by so many faces I knew... and yet I felt isolated.`
`The cicadas sounded no different than they had before now... but they seemed somehow false.`
`...The air was parched and dry, too... making me think... was the air in Hinamizawa always this uncomfortable?`
`"......Hey, Rena."`
`"What is it?`
` We're in class."`
`"...About the festival yesterday.`
` ...About... when would you say I got there...?"`
`"Huh?"`
`...To be honest, I was pretty excited afterwards... and I gobbled down some cans of beer...`
`I mean... it's kind of embarrassing, but... I don't quite remember... some things...`
`...For random babbling, it wasn't a bad excuse.`
`"Keiichi-kun, you said you couldn't come at first, didn't you?`
` You called Mii-chan's house about it, right?"`
`......That matched.`
`...I called Mion... and told her to take Satoko in my place, since I wouldn't be able to meet up with them due to things I had to do.`
`"We all decided while we were setting up for the festival that we'd invite Satoko-chan.`
` ...We wanted to bring her out someplace where she couldn't see her uncle for a little while."`
`...That was the same too.`
`...Mion said that when I called her.`
`That everyone had already decided to invite her.`
`"And then we all went, me, Mii-chan, and Rika-chan, to Satoko-chan's house, and brought her out.`
` ...Satoko-chan's uncle seems like a really mean person."`
`...That part didn't matter.`
`...What I was trying to ask was...`
`"...I... well...... When did I meet up with you...?"`
`"...How could you forget that?`
` ...Keiichi-kun, I think you shouldn't be drinking until you're an adult..."`
`"Whatever!`
` When did I meet up with you...?!"`
`"Uh! ......Um... well..."`
`At my sudden, threatening demand, Rena was at a loss for words.`
`...Oops, I shouldn't have rushed that...`
` ...I told her I was sorry.`
`"It was at the shrine grounds.`
` It was unexpected.`
` You were talking to Rika-chan, weren't you?"`
`"Yep.`
` You were having a fun talk with Rika-chan in her shrine maiden outfit.`
` And then Rena came up and said, 'Hau~~ I'm taking you home~'"`
`"...I was talking... to Rika-chan..."`
`"And I asked, 'Kei-chan, didn't you have something to do today?'`
` Then you pounded your chest and said it yourself.`
` That letting loose at a festival was more important than some silly errand."`
`...I didn't say that.`
`I never said anything like that.`
`...I never even went to the shrine grounds yesterday to begin with.`
`...I never had the time to stop by a place like that.`
`I went to dig the hole as soon as I woke up.`
`...I had a pretty hard time doing it.`
`...After that, I snuck into the school and made a call.`
`...I called him out and lay in wait.`
`...And then it started raining really hard.`
`With that kind of downpour, the festival should have come to a halt.`
`...In other words, it ended then.`
`...From the time the festival started to when it ended...`
`It would have been impossible for me to have swung by the shrine grounds.`
`...I was already there when Mion and the others dragged Satoko out and brought her to the shrine, and I was talking to Rika-chan.`
`...Then... where would Rika-chan say we met...?`
`The teacher went out to wash her hands, so I ran over to Rika-chan's desk and asked her directly.`
`"...With you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...We were talking to each other before Mion and the others got there, right?`
` ...When did we see each other?`
` When... and where...?"`
`"...I don't know what you're trying to ask."`
`"I, uh, drank so much beer I lost some of my memory...`
` I don't remember a thing.`
` ...Hehehehe..."`
`It looked like Rika-chan bought into my babbling.`
`"...We saw each other when the mayor and the others came out of the assembly hall.`
` You were in front of the ritual implement storehouse."`
`"...Huh?`
` What...?`
` ...The ritual implement storehouse?"`
`...I'd never heard a building called that before.`
`...Or maybe I have, but... At the very least, I wouldn't know where on the shrine grounds it was.`
`"...The mayor got real angry at you, since you shouldn't go near holy places without authority, remember...?`
` ...Keiichi, did you forget that too...?"`
`...I was too scared to ask any more.`
`The more I asked...`
` ...the more it became clear without any doubt...`
` that "Keiichi Maebara" was present at the Furude Shrine grounds during the Watanagashi festival.`
`The clearer that became...`
`The more doubts—no, fears—I had... Who on earth was I yesterday?`
`Whoever that was... he had a good time in my place... and managed to go the entire day without letting them notice I wasn't there...`
`...Oh, right.`
` ...When... did that person leave everyone?`
`This morning, my mother got mad at me for having stayed out so late last night.`
`...Which meant at the very least... that "Keiichi Maebara" hadn't come home while my mother was still awake...`
`The festival would have been closed because of the downpour.`
`...If I recall right... when I went back to the house's storage room to get another shovel... I think the clock said seven.`
`Since it was already raining hard by then... the festival would have had to close down before seven.`
`If I'd returned that early... I would have definitely run into my parents.`
`...Or, at the very least... they wouldn't have asked me when I got back last night.`
`So the "Keiichi Maebara" from yesterday... that meant...`
` he never went home.`
`That meant... the downpour happened, the festival was broken up... everyone left.`
`...But... he didn't go back to the house.`
`...Umm...... that means...?`
`...When I arrived at the natural conclusion...`
` a wicked chill... suddenly froze my spine... and climbed up to my brain...`
`...That meant...`
` "Keiichi Maebara"...`
` was the same as Satoshi.`
`...One day... he never went home.`
`On the night of Watanagashi... he never went home.`
`...The downpour interrupted the festival... and on the way home... he suddenly disappeared...`
`And... I, who was dealing with the corpse... went home without a problem.`
`I was so tired I wasn't even hungry, so... I went up to my room without a sound... and crawled into my futon......`
`...Who... was I?`
`That much was obvious.`
`Keiichi Maebara.`
` ...Keiichi Maebara was me.`
`There may have been another one, but that doesn't negate the fact that I was Keiichi Maebara.`
`...Then... that other Keiichi Maebara... was... what...?`
`The voices of the cicadas, steadily filling the classroom, were beginning to bother me...`
`Suddenly... I laid eyes on Satoko.`
`...Satoko's expression was dark as always... She seemed completely exhausted... at a life of agony she couldn't even imagine an ending to.`
`...What had last night been like for Satoko?`
`Did she have fun with everyone and feel a little happier, if even for a moment?`
`And... when she went home.`
`The end of her dream.`
`She'd probably gone to sleep afraid of when her uncle would return.`
`And then... this morning.`
`...Her uncle hadn't come home.`
`...And then she went to school.`
`Right now... she must have been still trapped by the rotten idea from which she couldn't be saved... that her uncle would need her when she got back.`
`But you can... rest easy, Satoko.`
`...Your uncle won't ever be coming back.`
`I couldn't tell her it was because I'd killed him.`
`...When Satoko realized on her own... that her uncle would never return... then that would truly be the end of the long, insane night.`
`That's right.`
`...I didn't do anything wrong.`
`...I did the best possible thing I could have as Satoko's Nii-nii.`
`Not an atom in my body regretted it.`
`And look...`
`Calm down and think, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...From a certain point of view... isn't it convenient there was another "Keiichi Maebara"?`
`I buried the corpse perfectly.`
`A "beginning" wouldn't happen.`
`...But... if worst came to worst, and it got out, and the investigation got to me...`
`I now had a strong alibi, able to profess the "fact" that I'd been at the Watanagashi Festival.`
`...But accepting something so creepy... and using it as an alibi...`
`Still... if I proved I hadn't gone to the festival yesterday, it would do no good and a whole lot of harm.`
`...That... was what left the really, actually bad aftertaste.`
`...You'll forget about it, Keiichi Maebara.`
`Everything that happened before today.`
`...So just forget... about the Keiichi Maebara who was there yesterday, too.`
`Instead, let's watch gently over Satoko... for the day her smile returns.`
`And the day...`
` that would mark the end of that insane, all-too-long night.`
`"That's all for today, class.`
` Please go straight back to your homes, everyone!`
` President, if you would."`
`"Everybody stand up! At attention!`
` Bow."`
`"""Good-bye!!"""`
`I thought about many things... and saw my thoughts dispersed by many other things. `
`...I didn't know whether or not that time had been spent worrying or daydreaming, but either way, it came to an end along with the class.`
`Cheerfully, our classmates got their things and ran for the hallway.`
`Mion, Rena, and Rika-chan were packing up as well.`
`...What about Satoko...?`
`This whole day... she's seemed deflated.`
`Well, her uncle may not have returned last night... but she wouldn't have known he'd never return.`
`...How much I wanted to express that fact to her...`
`Satoko packed up her pencil box and math workbook messily... and after a dark glance at the clock... heaved a sigh.`
`...Then went to leave the classroom.`
`Then... suddenly, somebody placed a hand on her shoulder and stopped her.`
`".........What is it...?`
` ...I watered the plants like I was supposed to, and got all the print-outs done..."`
`...Her words, possessed by a persecution complex, hurt...`
`I spoke loudly so everyone could hear.`
`"Hey, everyone!`
` Why don't... why don't we have club today?`
` It's been a while!"`
`Satoko always had to tend to her uncle... so club has been on hiatus.`
`...In our minds, our club was proof of a calm, peaceful life.`
`By enjoying being together... I wanted to make Satoko realize her days of darkness were over.`
`"I'm... okay.`
` I'll do it."`
`"......Meep."`
`"...Well, I mean.`
` I don't mind.`
` ...If it's okay with Satoko."`
`Under a condition.`
`...That was important.`
`...With everything up to her, Satoko gave a worried look.`
`"Come on, Satoko, it's been a long time!`
` Let's go crazy!!"`
`"...Well... I'm happy you feel that way, but..."`
`My uncle might already be home.`
` ...Thus spoke her darkened eyes, her mouth unmoving.`
`"You've been choking on life every day for a while. You must be about to suffocate.`
` It's not good for your mind or body!`
` Once in a while, you've gotta have some fun!!"`
`"......Please, leave it alone.`
` ...It's not like I... don't want to do club again..."`
`With one word, "but..."`
` She looked down...`
`"Satoko, you know as well as anyone that it's more fun being with everyone, right?`
` We're friends!`
` That means we can spend time with each other! `
`I mean, you had a great time at the festival yesterday with everyone, didn't you?"`
`...Rena nearly said something... but she was too late.`
`"......Keiichi-san... what are you saying...?"`
`My arm on her shoulder seemed to weigh her down... and she threw it off.`
`"...When exactly... was I playing and having fun at the festival?`
` The only one having fun... was you, Keiichi-san."`
`".........Huh......"`
`I looked over to Mion for help.`
` ...But now everyone was looking down.`
`...My instincts told me...`
`That Satoko... hadn't gone to the festival.`
`But... Rena said it herself.`
`That she went with Mion to Satoko's house to invite her...`
`"......Satoko-chan... left on the way there.`
` ...She didn't go to the shrine."`
`"...Wh... Why...!?"`
`I realized the absurdity of what I'd just said with Satoko in front of me.`
`"...She said her uncle was waiting at home... and she couldn't have fun by herself.`
` ...When we were in front of the shrine."`
`"We... we tried to stop her too.`
` We told her her uncle said it was okay, and that he wouldn't get mad if she had a good time..."`
`At some point... tears had begun welling up in Satoko's eyes.`
`...Satoko... was so afraid of her uncle...`
` that she couldn't even allow herself time with her friends...`
` and went home.`
`...No... she was even afraid...`
` of letting herself have a good time with her friends.`
`"...Keiichi-san, you must have it nice...`
` having a blast at the festival all night.`
` ...They told me you went all-out, didn't you?`
` ...I'm very envious."`
`Smiling to herself, her tears began to fall.`
`"...I... must provide for my uncle.`
` It's completely different from you... with how you let your parents do everything...!"`
`"......Satoko..."`
`"...I'm so glad you enjoyed yourself at the festival...!`
` I'm so glad you had enough fun for me too!! `
`I mean... I want to participate in the club too!!`
` Making such a racket with everyone... is so much fun...!!!`
` But... right now... I can't... I can't!!"`
`Unable to withstand such violent emotion... a few teardrops slid down her cheek.`
`...But even though she was having such a terrible time... not once did she ever say that it was hard for her.`
`...It was a sad... obstinate bravery.`
`But... the days when Satoko had to feel like that were over.`
`Satoko didn't need to... to endure it, to bear it anymore!`
`She could forget all about it now... and smile...!`
`I was so frustrated at not being able to tell her that directly.`
`Instead... I said something...`
` that I'm not sure I should have said, before I thought twice about it.`
`"......He didn't...`
` come home, did he?"`
`The words were deeply meaningful to me... but I didn't know if Satoko understood them.`
`"...Didn't come home... Who...?!"`
`"...He didn't come home last night, did he...?`
` ...Your uncle?"`
`"What are you talking about, Keiichi-san...!!"`
`Satoko shouted... with all her might.`
`"When has he not been there?!`
` When?!`
` When?!?"`
`"...C-Calm down...`
` I mean... He didn't... come home yesterday... did he?"`
`"I don't understand... what you're trying to say, Keiichi-san!!"`
`"S-Satoko... what are you talking about...?!`
` I mean... that man, I..."`
`I killed him.`
`Killed him yesterday.`
`Killed him for sure.`
`And I buried him.`
`Buried him whole.`
`He could never have returned to his house.`
`"Even yesterday... he was torturing me so much...!!`
` He yelled at me!`
` He shouted at me!!`
` He found fault with everything I did!!`
` He threw the dinner I made him on the floor!! `
`He dumped his bowl of miso soup on me, too!!`
` It was hot!`
` It was messy!!`
` And I cleaned all of it up!!`
` I cleaned!!`
` All of it!!!`
` Fuwaaaaaaahhhhhn...!! Waahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"`
`...What......?`
`Our stories... weren't matching up.`
`"...He...`
` ...ba...`
` ...night...?"`
`"And this morning... When he woke me up to make him breakfast... he got so mad at me!!`
` He would have gotten mad at me whether I'd gotten up or not...!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`"...Satoko..."`
`Rika-chan went over to Satoko and said a few words of consolation.`
`...But Satoko angrily refused those words and thrust Rika-chan away.`
`"...Nii-nii!!`
` Nii-niiii!!`
` Come back... Come baaaack! Waahhhhhhh!!!"`
`Crying, Satoko slowly walked out into the hallway.`
` After a moment, Rika-chan went after her...`
`I couldn't stop thinking... about the words Satoko had spoken while crying.`
`...I buried her uncle last night.`
`...But she said... this morning...`
`That was impossible.`
`I buried him last night... so she couldn't have seen her uncle this morning...!`
`...What was... what was Satoko......`
`At that point... I heard Mion's cold voice.`
`"...Hey, Kei-chan.`
` ...What did you mean...`
` about Satoko's uncle?"`
`Gulp.`
`...I said too much... I let my emotions get the better of me...`
`"Rena heard it too.`
` ...You said Satoko-chan's uncle didn't come home."`
`"Why?`
` Why didn't he come home...?"`
`"That's strange.`
` Satoko-chan's uncle was right there this morning, wasn't he?`
` So why would you say he didn't come back? Come back...?"`
`"...Kei-chan, you've been saying weird things for a while~"`
`...Suddenly, Mion and Rena... started to speak in strange and creepy voices.`
`What were... they... doing...?`
` What... were they saying...?`
`"...Kei-chan... is it somehow inconvenient for you for Satoko's uncle to be around...?"`
`"You... No, what are you talking about...?`
` Of course it would be better if Satoko's uncle wasn't here...!"`
`"Yep.`
` That's true, of course. If only he weren't here. Right?`
` ...Ahahahahaha."`
`...Something... something wasn't right.`
`...The next thing I knew... Mion and Rena... were smiling thinly... and their eyes were dark and muddy, in a way that I'd never seen before.`
`...And as our eyes met... that mud even seemed to fill the air...`
`"Satoko's uncle is an awful person, no doubt.`
` I think we'd all be better off with him gone just as much as you do.`
` But he's here.`
` There's nothing we can do, right...?"`
`Nothing we can... do...`
`...Something's wrong. Something's clearly wrong here.`
`...What the hell... was happening...`
`After a moment... a chilly, liquid-like feeling, as though my blood had been mixed with sherbet, crawled up my spine...`
`"No choice... I mean... of course there isn't, but...!!`
` But... then Satoko will never...!"`
`"If there's no choice... what would you do...?"`
`...Urgh...`
`......Rena... was trying to prompt me to say more.`
`There really was no choice, so I killed him.`
`...I killed him to protect Satoko.`
`"......That's............ mgh......"`
`"Leave him alone.`
` I think things will resolve themselves soon enough."`
`"Satoko-chan said her uncle was here, so he's here.`
` He was here yesterday, and he's here today.`
` She said so, so it's fine, right? Right?"`
`...Mion and Rena were speaking unbelievably dismissively.`
`...How could they... be talking like that...?`
`Mion and Rena... they were my friends, and were seriously worried about Satoko's abuse, weren't they?`
`...They would never... blurt out... something like this...!!`
`And...... I definitely killed Satoko's uncle.`
`No matter what Satoko or anyone else says... I wouldn't acknowledge it, because him being alive was impossible.`
`There is no way he was alive.`
`...It was impossible.`
`...And yet... since Satoko herself said he was here... then he was alive.`
`I didn't know why or how... but suddenly, Mion and Rena were at my sides, standing there silently.`
`"...Let's go home, Kei-chan."`
`"...After we leave, Rena wants to go treasure hunting for the first time in a while.`
` Mii-chan is coming too."`
`"Kei-chan, you should come along.`
` ...Of course... you're not allowed to refuse."`
`If words could freeze blood...`
` ...then there was no doubt... that they would have frozen me solid.`
`...I could hear it... a strained sound, like a layer of thin ice spreading... emanating from every joint in my body.`
`And with them closely at my sides... we left the school, as if they were police officers taking me away...`
`They talked about silly things the entire way home, like they always did... but they always stood at my sides... as if to prevent me from escaping.`
`...This was strange.`
`...Everything about this day was strange.`
`Actually... it had been strange ever since the previous night.`
`Yes, thinking back... it'd been strange ever since killing Satoko's uncle.`
`That creepy meeting with Takano-san... was only the beginning.`
`That insane night... was still continuing.`
` ......Yes. It still hadn't ended.`
`"...What?`
` What's wrong, Kei-chan, why did you suddenly stop...?"`
`"Ah... Sorry... It's nothing..."`
`When I stopped... it was distant, but I definitely heard them.`
`...An extra set of footsteps.`
` ...That was proof.`
`...Proof that insane night hadn't ended...`
`Mion left where she usually did... and finally we came to my house.`
`"...Okay, Keiichi-kun.`
` Wait here for me.`
` Rena will come to pick you up soon."`
`What was it—she was inviting me along on one of her oversized garbage 'treasure hunts' at the dam site, right?`
`But... why now?`
`...Mion coming along was strange too.`
`...Mion may have accepted Rena's little hobby, but she hated fishing through garbage, so she'd never come with her before.`
`And the location specifically being the dam site... was a little creepy.`
`The dam construction site was completely outside the flow of everyday life... It was so remote that no one ever went there unless they thought to in particular.`
`...Nobody lived there, and there were no lights, so at night it got dark very quickly.`
`...I was being forcibly invited there.`
`...There was no reason I had to fear Rena and Mion.`
`...Besides, wouldn't the trouble I'd make by refusing them be a pain to deal with...?`
`...In that way, it didn't seem like going treasure hunting with them was a bad idea.`
`......But... that insane night was continuing.`
`Haven't the sirens of instinct been wailing in my mind for a while now...?`
`Warning me that Rena and Mion... were strange.`
` ...That I needed... to be cautious.`
`...The warning sirens were so freaking loud it felt like my head would split in two.`
`"...Ah... Rena.`
` ...I... I actually have something to do."`
`"Something to do?`
` Like what?"`
`"Like what...? It's... I just have something to do, okay?"`
`"If you had something to do, why didn't you say it while Mii-chan was here?`
` I already told her to meet us at the dam site before we split up."`
`Rena was smiling... but her words made her discomfort clear.`
`"...S...Sorry.`
` I just... kind of missed the opportunity to say so..."`
`"Really...?"`
`...You're lying, aren't you?`
`You just made that up now, you liar.`
` ...That's what Rena's eyes said to me.`
`"...Umm... I... my, er, head hurts.`
` I might have a cold.`
` ...So I wanted to go get it checked out and get some medicine."`
`"Really...?"`
`...That... wasn't really a lie...`
`My head did hurt a little bit... so I wasn't lying.`
`...Rena... she couldn't figure out if my head hurt or not... just by looking at it...!`
`"..................`
`Then...`
` I guess that's that."`
`After staring me in the eyes for a few moments... she fired a sharp, needle-like stare at me.`
`...The tension in my body loosened, and I felt like my knees might buckle.`
`"...If you're going to the clinic, then you should go soon.`
` Sometimes they close early."`
`"...Thanks.`
` ...I'll do that."`
`"Make sure you go, okay?`
` To the hospital."`
`"...I... I will..."`
`"Go, for real."`
`"...I will..."`
`It seemed liked Rena had realized that I was going to refuse her invitation for a while now.`
`With how serious she looks... she might actually call the clinic later to make sure I went...`
`...I couldn't say anything careless...`
`...Lying about getting checked out was just an excuse to decline her request in the first place.`
` ...It didn't matter... whether I actually went.`
`"...Yeah... I'll go.`
` ...If you want, I can bring you the bill tomorrow..."`
`"...Oh, that would be good.`
` Be sure to bring it, okay?`
` Rena will look at it then."`
`......Another tingle... started crawling up my back.`
`...There was no ignoring it... Rena and Mion must have been monitoring my movements.`
`That wasn't normal.`
` Far from it.`
`...All of it was... insane.`
`I did what I did... because I wanted my peaceful life back.`
`But... what... what on earth was all this?`
`...It was far from peaceful... Something had gone mad... leaving the world out of order.`
`With the other... 'Keiichi Maebara'...`
`With those creepy footsteps I've been hearing...`
`With Rena and Mion acting so curious...`
`...And above all...`
` with him being alive.`
`...Where was I?`
`...Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone.`
` ...I knew that much.`
`...Was this really the Hinamizawa I knew?`
`"...Hey, 'Keiichi Maebara'... Where... is this?"`
`I asked, whipping around before the front door... to face the one who has been following in my wake all day.`
`......Nobody would have been there, of course.`
`".................."`
`..."Keiichi Maebara," huh.`
`...That's what I just called him... called the one who had been trailing behind me this whole time.`
`...That shadowy presence... always clinging to me... like it was constantly watching for the opportunity to change places.`
`Footsteps always following me... was another impossibility.`
`...It couldn't have been a ghost... so it was just impossible.`
`So the strangeness must have been`
` my ears, my head,`
` or Hinamizawa.`
`...Everything I could see was the same exact Hinamizawa I knew so well... and that gave me the creeps.`
`...Eventually I decided to actually go to the clinic.`
`I really didn't want to go outside...`
` but a stronger feeling than that desire was the fear Rena might actually be keeping an eye on me to see if I went to the hospital.`
`But... before I went to the clinic... there was something I wanted to make sure of.`
`It was... at school.`
`I pretended I'd forgotten something...`
`And was going back to the classroom to pick it up.`
`...As soon as the thought crossed my mind... I was overwhelmed by paranoia.`
`...I was just going to the classroom... but I hated it so much... having to be so careful to fake it.`
`After carefully verifying once more that nobody was watching... I went over to the locker.`
`...Yes, Satoshi's locker.`
`...I committed the crime with the bat I found in this locker—Satoshi's bat.`
`And then... I had thrown the bat into the swamp.`
`Which meant... the bat shouldn't have been inside.`
`...But...`
` but...`
` what if...`
`The bat... was still in here...?`
`...It was a very dreadful... incomprehensible idea...... But if it was true... it would explain a lot.`
`...If... the bat was in here...`
` yesterday's events...`
` would have all been a delusion... no, an illusion.`
`I hadn't killed anyone... and I'd gone to the festival.`
` I had a great time rampaging about with everyone.`
`It would prove that... 'Keiichi Maebara'... was really me.`
`Proof that I was only under some strange assumption that I had killed Satoko's uncle.`
`...Proof that it had all been a wild fantasy.`
`...That would explain everything.`
`...Nothing happened yesterday.`
`...I had just gone mad, unable to separate my shocking, uncle-killing dream from reality.`
`...That would explain everything.`
`...If the bat was here... would I be able to accept that reality?`
`If it was here... nothing will have changed.`
`...If it was here... it would just mean... I'd gone crazy...`
`Preparing myself for the worst... I opened the locker door.`
`...I was actually scared of opening it slowly, so I threw it open with a bang!`
`"....................."`
`And just like the first time... the choking scent of smell and sweat, like a stale towel, came flowing out.`
`...There was a baseball uniform... and some miscellaneous other things, like notebooks.`
` ...There was also a shoe pouch...`
`...And as for the bat,`
` it wasn't here.`
` ...It was how I left it when I took the bat out.`
`...There was no doubt: yesterday really happened.`
`...Now that I knew I wasn't a lunatic, I felt relieved.`
`...But at the same time... if I wasn't the crazy one... then Hinamizawa was...`
` and that was evidence of a reality I found just as difficult to accept.`
`...There was noise, somehow, creeping into everything I saw, and the world was losing a tiny bit of color.`
`...So, what did I know about last night now?`
`Now that I'd made sure the bat wasn't there... I didn't need to be here anymore.`
`...Shall I go?`
` For real... to the hospital.`
`It was my first time going to the hospital, but from what I'd heard, it wasn't far from school.`
`My mom had told me where it was—a big, easy-to-see road went straight there.`
`I went past the shopping street... made a turn...`
`It wasn't overly hard to spot the sign with "Irie Clinic" written on it.`
`There was one other person, an older man, there in the air-conditioned waiting room.`
`I went up to the counter and told them it was my first time here.`
`...The man behind the counter glanced at the clock and said there would be a short wait.`
`...It was almost five.`
`Clinic hours would be ending soon.`
`...As I sat in this unfamiliar waiting room, isolated from everyone... and let myself feel the cool air... I actually felt relieved.`
`What should I tell the doctor when he comes?`
`...I could tell him I had a cold, but I was the very picture of health.`
`...Actually, I wanted him to check my head.`
` ...I wanted someone to confirm for me... whether I was really sane or not...`
`"Keiichi Maebara-san?`
` Please come into the examination room."`
`Huh?`
`The voice, from the other side of the examination curtain... I thought I'd heard it somewhere before.`
`"Hello.`
` This is the first time we've seen each other here."`
`"...Coach!`
` ...Coach, you... You were a doctor...!?"`
`Now that you mention it... he did seem to know his way around when he was looking at my shoulder in the nurse's office...`
`...It would make sense... if he was actually a doctor.`
`Come to think of it, our teacher called him 'Irie-sensei,' didn't she?`
`"Well yes, I'm more or less a doctor here.`
` ...Doctors have it really good, you know?`
` You get to see and touch all that young, silky smooth skin~☆. `
`I could inject them with a weird chemical that'd make them my slaves, and have them be my personal maids~~...☆"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Just seeing that made my cold go away.`
` I'll be leaving now.`
` Polite bow."`
`"Whoa, wait, wait!`
` Maebara-saaan!`
` A joke—it was a joke!`
` Come, come—sit down and let me take a look at you.`
` I'll need to use my stethoscope, so show me your silky-smooth chest, Maebara-san~"`
`For some reason... I felt really relieved.`
`...After that insane night... as much as I thought everything had gone crazy, Coach was here doing the same thing he always did—I was very happy for that.`
`"Hmm, you don't seem to have a cold.`
` ...Actually, those scrapes and cuts all over you seem to be the painful thing. `
`Don't tell me you were playing in the bushes with short sleeves and shorts?`
` I mean, I can't say for sure you haven't been infected with tetanus..."`
`As I was chasing that man last night, I'd kept being scraped by bits of trees.`
`I didn't realize I had so many cuts...`
`"You went a little too crazy at the festival yesterday.`
` Enjoy that while you're young."`
`...And once again, I apparently went to the festival.`
`"...Coach...`
` Did you go too?`
` ...To the festival."`
`"Yes.`
` Of course I did.`
` I may be a doctor, but I'm also on the Watanagashi executive committee."`
`"...Did you... see me there?"`
`This Coach was the same Coach that I'd always known, and I felt like I could trust him more than my weird friends... so I asked.`
`"Well, actually...`
` I was drinking in the main tent with the chairman and the others the whole time... I didn't go out to see the festival at all.`
` I don't think I saw you."`
`"...Oh."`
`"That was a strange question.`
` Did you have too much to drink and forget about what happened last night?`
` And underaged, too—you bad child."`
`Coach let out a laugh.`
`...He didn't laugh in an unnatural way, like Mion and Rena did.`
`...Coach was okay.`
` ...He was the Coach from the world I knew.`
` He wasn't someone from this abnormal world...`
`"...Well...`
` This all...`
` might seem a little weird to you, but...`
` I want you to hear me out without laughing."`
`"Yes, go ahead.`
` I greatly welcome any shy, bashful worries you might have as you come into your secondary sex characteristics~☆."`
`"............Could it...`
` be possible...`
` that I have... an identical twin?"`
`Coach hadn't expected that question at all, and couldn't say anything for a moment.`
`But then... he smiled calmly and quietly answered.`
`"This is just superstition... but I've heard before that everyone has two other people in the world who look just like them.`
` ...If there was, I'd certainly like to meet him, though.`
`Also, there are plenty of fairy tales where a person's double appears.`
` The German ones about doppelgangers are probably the most famous."`
`"'Doppelgangers'?"`
`"Yes.`
` They look exactly like another person.`
` Apparently they herald misfortune, and if you meet one, you're sure to die soon... I think that's how it went."`
`...When you meet them...`
` you're sure...`
` to die soon.`
`...The story ended directly in death, plain and simple... and it made my spine tingle.`
`...Coach wasn't saying it to scare me, though—he was just offering a casual anecdote, but that made it feel all the more real.`
`"...Have you ever heard of... one of those things... showing up in Hinamizawa?"`
`"What?!`
` ......Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` Well, I can't say that I have.`
` Ha-ha-ha-ha!"`
`Coach must have thought he was being teased, so he laughed in an exaggerated way.`
`But... when I didn't smile along with him, his laughter steadily grew fainter.`
`"...I'm sorry... well... I was sort of being serious."`
`"...No... I apologize for laughing.`
` ...Was there something you were worried about?"`
`...I wondered if I should tell him... then, after resolving myself one final time... I slowly spoke.`
`"...I... I didn't go to the festival yesterday."`
`"Is that right?`
` ...Well, there will be one next year.`
` And then you can—"`
`"That's not what I meant!!!`
` ......I didn't go to the festival... but according to everyone else... I was there.`
` ...Could that... even be possible?!"`
`After blinking his eyes in amazement... Coach thought seriously about what I was trying to say.`
`...And he answered, choosing his words carefully.`
`"...Let me make sure I have this straight.`
` ...Maebara-kun, you went to the Watanagashi Festival, but don't remember it... Am I right?"`
`...I was trying to say something completely different... but I suppose any sane person would come to that conclusion.`
`...That night, Keiichi Maebara was actually at the festival, but I was saying I didn't go.`
` ...That obviously meant my memories of going there had failed me.`
`...But... that was absolutely impossible.`
`...That vivid act I had committed during the downpour couldn't possibly have been an illusion.`
`All these scrapes on my body prove it, as does the fact the bat wasn't in the locker.`
`"...No... That's not it, Coach.`
` ...I really didn't go to the festival."`
`"Please don't take offense, Maebara-san.`
` ...Have you ever had an experience where you were suddenly somewhere unfamiliar, and you couldn't remember why?"`
`"No.`
` And I didn't lose my memories or anything.`
` ...Because while the festival was going on... I was definitely doing something else.`
` It wasn't like I was asleep and unconscious or anything."`
`"...You're certain you were doing something else?`
` ...I know I'm being awfully rude, but... Are you sure you're not mistaken?"`
`"I know I'm not.`
` My memories are clear as day... and they were real."`
`"...During the festival, you weren't at the shrine, and you were doing something somewhere else.`
` ...Can you definitely prove that?"`
`"............Um..."`
`That's right.`
` ...Thinking it through... brought me to this.`
`There was only one way to prove that I really wasn't at the festival yesterday.`
`...And that was... to show that there was no doubt I had killed her uncle.`
`Coach saw me struggling to answer... and his eyes looked a little cold.`
`...I guess they would.`
` ...After all, from Coach's perspective... I was just a weirdo sputtering nonsense.`
`"......Would you like to lay down?`
` Maybe you should relax and take it easy for a bit."`
`"Sorry.`
` I didn't really come here to lay down."`
`"...You seem to be a little worked up.`
` Why don't I give you a sedative that'll let you sleep for a bit?`
` That way—"`
`"I'm not being strange!!!"`
`I realized coach was treating me like a deviant, so I raised my voice.`
`"......I apologize if I've offended you.`
` So please... calm down..."`
`"I definitely didn't go to the festival!`
` That's the truth!!"`
`"...I understand.`
` I understand, so please, calm down, take a deep breath—"`
`"No, you don't understand at all!!!"`
`Coach was stunned... and stared in stupefaction.`
`"I do understand, Maebara-san.`
` You didn't go to the festival yesterday.`
` ...Is that right?`
` I believe you.`
` I believe you..."`
`Coach jotted down a brief note in his records.`
`...He was writing it in German.`
` ...So that his patient wouldn't know what it said.`
`...But I could make a good guess as to what he wrote.`
`"You won't believe me until I tell you everything I was doing at the time, will you?"`
`"......No, I believe you.`
` Please, sit down..."`
`Before I sat... I tilted my head back a little.`
`...The blood in my face... all drained out... and I quieted down.`
`...After taking a deep breath... I made sure that I was calm now.`
`"...It would have been impossible for me to be at the festival.`
` ...Because... at the time, I was...`
`......"`
`...Should I tell him, or not...?`
`...I really... didn't want to go on living like this... feeling this horrible...`
`...And... I said them... the final, fatal words.`
`"...Because I was...`
` killing Satoko's uncle at the time."`
`I could smell the concrete in the room... I could feel the air around us sharpen.`
`Nobody moved.`
`...Only the sound of the clock ticking told us time hadn't stopped.`
`With his mouth wide open... Coach even forgot to blink for a little while.`
`"...You... killed Satoko-chan's... uncle...?"`
`...Yeah.`
` ...It's fine now, Keiichi Maebara.`
` ...Don't hesitate.`
` ...Admit it... with all your strength!`
`"...Yes.`
` Last night... I did it.`
` I killed him."`
`".................."`
`I spoke clearly and fluidly.`
`I could easily tell that Coach's mind had gone completely blank...`
`"...Why... would you...`
` ...No!`
` ...That... was a foolish question..."`
`"I believed it was the most direct method of saving Satoko, so I carried it out.`
` I don't have any regrets."`
`"......I... I see.`
` ......Heh........."`
`Coach smiled thinly... and nodded a bit.`
`"...So I couldn't have been at the festival."`
`I left the brightness of my house for the darkness of the outside.`
`After that, I dug holes, made phone calls... I had my hands full.`
`...And then I attacked him...`
` killed him...`
` and buried him.`
` It was pouring hard at the time.`
`The festival started that evening, but was suspended due to the rain.`
`...There were no gaps in my memories.`
`From the late afternoon until it started to rain,`
` there was no time for me to possibly have gone to the festival.`
`"...And those wounds... are they from that...?"`
`"Yes.`
` There's a road through the forest near Satoko's house.`
` I attacked him there... he ran, but I chased him... and finally killed him near the road that leads to town."`
`"......Is that... true...?"`
`Killing her uncle—it wasn't some wild fantasy?`
`I could tell that Coach didn't believe me.`
`...So I spoke slowly, not letting myself grow excited.`
`"It's true.`
` I killed him with Satoshi's bat.`
` I threw it and the uncle's motorbike into the swamp.`
` I dug a hole, killed him, and buried him.`
` ...I did it all by myself."`
`"Satoko-chan's uncle drove past you on a motorbike, did he...?`
` Then you... predicted he'd do that and just... waited?"`
`"I assumed he wouldn't be leaving his house that day.`
` ...So I lied to him over the phone to get him out."`
`"You called him?`
` But your house is so far away from Satoko-chan's.`
` I wouldn't think you'd be able to make it there so soon after calling him."`
`"I used a phone closer to where I was going to attack him—the one at school."`
`"But, Maebara-san...`
` It was Sunday.`
` Wouldn't the school have been locked up?"`
`"A forest ranger happened to go inside for a bit.`
` I slipped in when I had the chance."`
`...After that, Coach grilled me on a few different things regarding the incident.`
`He made sure to question me carefully... looking for any contradictions in my account.`
`"..................`
` I'll believe you.`
` ...What you did yesterday... doesn't seem like a dream."`
`I explained everything, including minor details that only someone who had actually committed the act could explain.`
`...I could, of course.`
` ...It was only yesterday.`
`Coach realized... that my story had no expedient coincidences or too-convenient details that would have existed in a daydream or a delusion... and finally seemed to want to believe me.`
`"...So... do you still think I went to the festival and lost my memory...?"`
`".................."`
`Coach slowly shook his head.`
`"...But everyone in class... They said I was at the festival yesterday.`
` Is that even... possible?"`
`"No, it's not...`
` ...Your classmates probably mistook you for someone who looked very similar.`
` Then, given how group psychology works, everyone just assumed that you had been at the festival."`
`......They couldn't have mistaken me.`
`...Mion and all the rest said they were spending time with 'Keiichi Maebara.'`
` It was much more than just having mistaken someone else for me.`
`But... saying that out loud... would just confuse Coach...`
`He spoke to me in whispered tones.`
`"...Do you feel... guilty at all?"`
`It didn't sound like he was criticizing me.`
`...And even if he had, I would have flatly said the same thing.`
`"I don't.`
` ...I did it so that I could return the peaceful days that he'd stolen from us.`
` So I plan to forget all about having killed him and live my life as usual. `
`Once Satoko's regular smile returns, the one from before he showed up... everything will finally be over."`
`"............Any chance that someone witnessed the crime...?"`
`"I don't think so.`
` ...If someone had seen me, I would have been arrested already."`
`"......I am a doctor.`
` My job is to save lives.`
` ...So I cannot make any statements to the effect of condoning the taking of another's life.`
` ...So instead, I will say this."`
`Coach... slowly rose... and placed a hand on my shoulder.`
`"...For saving Satoko-chan...`
` I thank you."`
`...Coach's eyes... started shedding warm tears.`
`...When I looked at him... I started to feel some tears of my own...`
`"......Mgh......... hic.........!"`
`I didn't know... what I was crying for.`
`...And so, for a little while... the two men in the room fought back their tears.`
`"...But... it's strange."`
`"What is...?"`
`"I'm sure I killed him... and yet... he seems to have returned home alive."`
`Coach's expression immediately sharpened.`
`"...Depending on the situation, there are many ways that mere unconsciousness can look like real death to a layperson.`
` Do you think it's possible he was just knocked out?"`
`"I didn't check for a pulse... but I'm pretty sure I did him in."`
`"...Can I ask you to reproduce the situation in which you attacked him, Maebara-san?"`
`Coach rolled up a health and fitness week poster nearby and offered it to me—to represent the bat.`
`...Though I may have been lost to the emotions of a beast that night, I remembered in detail the number of times I swung the bat, the angles I had swung from, and the force I had applied.`
`Using Coach as a stand-in for the uncle, I reproduced them over, one by one...`
`"And when he tripped and fell... I bashed him in the top of the head, like this.`
` When I did, it felt different from the other strikes.`
` ...I thought I'd cracked his skull."`
`...Coach was calmly analyzing this information, using the places I'd struck and the situation at hand, to find out what state the uncle's body had been in.`
`"I wasn't totally sure he was dead, so I hit him a few more times after he fell."`
`"Did he react at all?"`
`"At first, I sort of felt his body jolting with every hit, but eventually that stopped too, and he didn't react at all."`
`"...............Hmm..."`
`Coach folded his arms and said "hmm" a few times.`
` ...And then he spoke.`
`"...He's dead.`
` There's not much doubt about it."`
`"He didn't just look like he was...?"`
`"...I can't say very much from just your story, Maebara-san, but I think it's almost certain.`
`...Besides, you buried the corpse in the mud, and that took you quite a bit of time, right?`
` Let's say it took you thirty minutes.`
` ...That would mean he was buried under the muddy water for those thirty minutes. `
`...If you don't breathe for that long, your brain will die no matter what."`
`"...You mean, even ignoring how hard I hit him, he would definitely have died while I was burying him...?"`
`"That's right.`
` It's impossible to stay alive buried underground for thirty minutes."`
`"......Impossible... You're right.`
` But!`
` Satoko... she says he's alive!!"`
`Coach, a doctor, just gave his stamp of approval... that he was dead for sure...`
` ...That made it seem all the more unfair that he could still be among the living...`
`"...Maebara-san.`
` ...This... is a really horrible idea, but...`
` Is it possible that the person you killed... wasn't actually her uncle...?"`
`"...Huh?!"`
`...He's right... that could be why...`
` It cleared up the inconsistency of my definitely having killed someone, but him still being alive.`
`"There's no way...!!`
` I mean, we were both at Satoko's house when she was bringing his alcohol inside, and there was a man who stuck his face out the window to look!`
` It was him, right?!`
` That was Satoko's uncle, right?!"`
`"......Yes.`
` You're not wrong.`
` It was that man."`
`"...Could she have had more than one uncle or something?!"`
`"Not one that I've ever heard of.`
` It's just him."`
`"Could you tell me... what he looked like?"`
`"...Well... his height, first.`
` ...He was... about 175 centimeters, maybe a little taller."`
`In order to eliminate the worst possibility—that I'd killed someone else, Coach began to thoroughly compare what the man in his mind looked like with what I told him the person I killed looked like.`
`But... no matter how in-depth my description went, none of the characteristics differed.`
`...The uncle's traits, according to Coach, were all exactly the same as the person I'd killed.`
`But those traits were all extremely vague... and they weren't particularly distinct, at a glance.`
`"...Could you, well... Is there anything else about him that would let us identify him for sure?"`
`"...Now that you mention it... I've never seen it, but...`
` I believe Satoko-chan once said a long time ago that he had a tattoo of... a tiger or something, on his back."`
`"A tattoo...?!"`
`...That was... really important.`
`...Not everyone had a tattoo.`
`...If I found a tiger tattoo on the back of the man's corpse... it would be proof I'd killed the right one.`
`At the moment, though... there was one other thing that would verify this.`
`To go to Satoko's house... and see for myself the uncle that had returned home despite having died.`
`...But... that was far more terrifying than digging up the body and looking at its back...`
`Without even looking at the tattoo... I knew for sure the one I'd killed had been Satoko's uncle.`
`...I cracked his head open and killed him.`
`...And yet... he'd gone back home.`
`...There wasn't any misunderstanding, or even the shadow of a doubt in my mind about having killed him.`
` And yet...`
`It was impossible for him to exist.`
`...Kind of like how "Keiichi Maebara" had been at the festival, despite it being impossible.`
`...That small commonality...  made me feel as though a faint but bizarre force was permeating this insane Hinamizawa...`
`"......I wonder...`
` what on earth could have happened.`
` ...Despite you not going to the festival and killing Satoko-chan's uncle...`
` ...You were at the festival, and the uncle you killed is alive..."`
`"...None of this... makes any sense.`
` ...When I look at everything that way... it's almost like I'm just having a nightmare... and there's no killer at all. `
`...But... it's the truth.`
` The sensation as I used my own hands, and that bat, to bash him again and again... It was no illusion or dream...!"`
`Coach let out a slow sigh, then after looking at the clock, got up.`
`"...Let's... go over this all a little more seriously.`
` If you'll excuse me, I'll go put on some tea.`
` ...Clinic's about to close, after all.`
` I need to let the other employees leave."`
`Coach stood up and went out into the hallway.`
`...Leaving me alone.`
`The clock was about to strike six.`
`...I was at the festival... and the uncle I'd killed was alive.`
`Had I... really... committed murder yesterday...?`
`The only whisper of a fact that proved it happened... was the absence of that bat from Satoshi's locker...`
`...In any case... I was glad that Coach had taken my nonsense seriously.`
`I just confessed to murder.`
`...Normally that would frighten a person away.`
`...But Coach didn't run—he cried with me.`
` ...I was glad he did.`
`Like so, my tension smoothly melted away, and I suddenly realized I really had to urinate.`
`...I thought to use the restroom while Coach had stepped out.`
`There was one across from the waiting room...`
`As soon as I left the room... I saw Coach and two male doctors wearing white clothing standing in the shadows of the hallway nearby.`
`...I didn't particularly intend to eavesdrop or anything... but I was quite surprised upon noticing how uneasy they seemed.`
`...I hid behind the wall... and quietly listened in...`
`It seemed like Coach was giving directions to the two doctors.`
`"Black tea?`
` I'll make some."`
`"Mix in amobarbital or Ravonal.`
` Cover the taste with milk and sugar."`
`"He may grow suspicious at the sudden onset of drowsiness.`
` It's possible he may get agitated and become violent..."`
`"We will handle that.`
` How many male staff are still here?"`
`"One Mountain Dog.`
` Including us, three."`
`...What... what was all this...?!`
`I think... I was already agitated, despite what Coach said.`
`...Was that it? Was it a just casual conversation... and it was only sounding unbelievable to me?!`
`Coach said he would bring some black tea and left the room.`
`And then... in the shadows, he was telling his subordinates to put some kind of sleeping powder in the tea??`
`Plus... they were getting extra help... in case I thought the sudden sleepiness was suspicious and started getting violent?!`
`...Hey, wait, Keiichi Maebara...!!`
`Calm down, calm down...!!`
` There's no way... something this stupid could be happening!!`
`I mean... he was genuinely listening... to my story... and he even cried with me!!`
`I thought... I thought he was the one person in Hinamizawa who would... understand...`
`This... this was... no, this was...!!`
`"There are signs of fabrications or falsehoods, and his memories of yesterday in particular are completely confused.`
` He can no longer tell truth from falsehood.`
` It's quite similar to multiple personality disorder. `
`...But as for how quickly this mental disorder emerged... It's just not normal...`
` Maybe it's inborn, or perhaps there were signs of it before he moved here. `
`...I'd like to take a look at any records of him staying at a mental hospital before he moved here.`
` ...In any case, I want him to take a quiet nap."`
`The two doctors nodded deeply.`
`"...I should probably contact Maebara-kun's parents, too.`
` ...Though I can't think of what to tell them...`
` ...Please find his home phone number for me."`
`...My eyes, still moist... began to shed tears once more.`
`This was... too cruel...!`
`I really thought... he had actually understood... and had believed what I'd told him...!`
`But now, from the other side of that wall... he was bluntly treating me like a crazy person...!!`
`I believed you... I believed you!!`
`I had let down my guard... because I thought you were the only ally I had left after that insane night...!!`
`Was that a lie?!`
`All that... about thanking me on Satoko's behalf... Were you just... pretending in order to keep me placated?!`
`...Uurrrrghhh...!!!`
`My tears... fell to the floor... in frustration...!`
`...I was an idiot...!`
` I was an idiot...!!`
` I was such an idiot... for believing that bastard...!!`
`I heard footsteps approaching the doctors.`
`...A man in a dress shirt with no tie came running up.`
`"Dr. Irie...!`
` It's terrible...!!`
` They... they found Takano-san!"`
`"Takano-san?`
` Wait, where?"`
`"W-Well...!`
` Apparently they discovered her burned corpse in the mountains in Gifu..."`
`"She's dead?!`
` Takano-san...?!"`
`The men, all surprised, exchanged glances.`
`...Dead...?`
` Takano-san...?`
`......Hey, wait... so then... does that mean when I cursed her, wishing for her death, that wish was granted...?!`
`"What do you mean, burned corpse?`
` Was it an accident?"`
`"...According to the Gifu police's statement, the possibility is extremely high that she was murdered..."`
`...Huhuhu... ahahaha...`
`...As I cried... I laughed quietly.`
`...Serves you right... Serves you right...!`
`If I hadn't run into that woman, my murder would have been perfect.`
`But she just had to come driving up to me... and tried to coerce me like that.`
`...I regretted not having killed her on the spot... but now she was dead anyway.`
`My curse, my wish for her demise—it was fulfilled...!!`
` Serves you right...!`
` Serves you right!!`
`"...Risa-san died, and Takano-san died.`
` ...What on earth could be happening in Hinamizawa?`
` ...Don't tell me... that this was all Oyashiro-sama's curse for this year...?!"`
`Like hell I'll let the curse be real, Coach said.`
` Everyone present just nodded as Coach cursed at no one in particular...`
`Ku-ku-ku-ku...!!`
`Yes, maybe it wasn't Oyashiro-sama, but this was definitely a spell, a curse...!`
`I wished for her to die.`
` So she did!!`
`...If this wasn't just a coincidence... and she died because I wished for it...`
`Then you'll die next, Coach!!`
`You... betrayed me.`
`You pretended to believe me, but deep down you thought I was a madman...!!`
`You looked down on me with all that pity in your eyes!!`
`"For now, get the black tea ready.`
` ...I'll bring it inside. I don't think he'd let anyone besides me be alone with him."`
`Shit... shit... shit!!!`
` What do I do?!`
` What do I do, Keiichi Maebara?!`
`This time I heard the voice of a nurse.`
`"Dr. Irie?`
` Oh, there you are.`
` You have a phone call."`
`"I'm a little busy at the moment, so please tell them I'll call back.`
` ...Who is it from?"`
`"A Mr. Ooishi from the Okinomiya Police Department."`
`"Ah... sheesh, what bad timing.`
` ...All right, I'll answer it."`
`Coach left to go answer the phone.`
`The other men headed towards the room with the teapot to make the black tea, like Coach had ordered them to.`
`...Fortunately, Coach having to take that phone call meant there would be extra time for me to act.`
`I had to decide what to do now...`
` Would I let him make me drink the sedative-infused tea... or be held down and thrown into a mental hospital?!`
`Nothing would come from starting a brawl here.`
`...They had more people anyway, and they were all bigger than me.`
` If it came to a fight, I didn't stand a chance in hell.`
`...If I couldn't win against them... then there was only one thing left to do:`
` run...`
`Adrenaline suddenly rushed into my brain, and my body... started to move with keen instinct, like it had on that night.`
`My surface temperature quickly cooled, and the transmission routes between my cells enlarged.`
`Using 360-degree visual information, I searched for an escape route.`
`...I would open the window behind me.`
`Outside was a parking lot.`
` There were no cars.`
`...A little beyond there was the bicycle I had taken to get here.`
`...I determined that this would be the quickest method of escape.`
`I approached the window swiftly, but with little sound, to raise as little suspicion as I could.`
`With the speed and silence of a shadow, like I'd had on that night I chased her uncle.`
`...I unlocked the window and opened it up.`
`...A cool evening breeze wafted in...`
`I stuck my head out and looked over the parking lot again.`
` ...Nobody in sight.`
` No need to hesitate.`
`I quietly crawled outside and closed the window behind me.`
`...I held my breath and listened carefully.`
`...Nobody seemed to have realized I'd run...`
`I looked around.`
`Then... I jumped onto my bicycle... and zoomed away.`
`The pedals clattered under the force.`
`Had my bike always creaked like this?`
` Did the pedals always whine every time I pushed down on them?`
`...My bike wasn't the only one crying, though.`
`My tears fell as the wind cut through them.`
` They rode the breeze and scattered behind me.`
`Uurghhh...!!`
`......I hate this... I hate this...!!`
`I'm not the crazy one... Hinamizawa is...!!`
`How... how dare you treat me like a madman...!!`
` Die!`
` Die!!`
` Just fucking die already!!!`
`I believed you! I believed you...!!!`
` Uwaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!`
`...I'd gone to the hospital in order to escape Rena and Mion's invitation...`
` but the reality that was waiting for me... had been too cruel.`
`...Who was insane—me, or Hinamizawa?`
` Or... was the answer something else?`
`I started having trouble breathing.`
`...I didn't... have any clue what was happening anymore.`
`The loud chirps of the higurashi were irritating me.`
`...Ah... Were even the Hinamizawa higurashi I knew so well calling into the wind...?`
`No, that wasn't quite it.`
`They weren't calling.`
`...They were crying.`
`The pained wailing... of those lost in some kind of rhythm... in another world... no longer able to return to their own sunlight.`
`I didn't... do all that to end up in a world like that...!!`
`And actually... at about this time... I might have been having fun with everyone else...!!`
`Satoko would have gotten her smile back after realizing her uncle wouldn't ever come home... and she might have shown it to us at our first club meeting in a while.`
`That was the kind of world... I wished for...!`
`So... what was this?!`
`Why... did I end up... in such a strange, ghastly world?!`
`Someone I'd killed was living like normal... and I had enjoyed myself at the festival despite not being there.`
`...I don't want it... I don't want this strange world!!!`
`When did it start to go wrong?!`
` When?!`
` When?!?`
`No matter how much I thought about it... I never understood.`
`I rode swiftly... and returned to my home.`
`It had begun to rain during my journey back, and just like yesterday, I was now soaked.`
`...But I didn't care about something so trivial right now.`
`...The pain I felt in my heart that Coach, the one person I trusted, was acting so cruelly... was far worse.`
`Did I have no allies in Hinamizawa anymore...?`
`With the naive thought... that I at least wanted my parents to side with me, I stepped up to the front door...`
`Wait... Keiichi.`
`...It'll be dark soon... There's something you want to check, right...?`
`Yes.`
` ...I wanted to dig up the man's corpse... and get a look... at his back.`
`If there was a tiger tattoo there, I would know beyond a doubt he was Satoko's uncle.`
`...That long night... wouldn't end until I was certain...`
`If this insane world... was all reparation, all a divine punishment...`
` then I needed to make certain... whether I had been successful enough to even deserve to pay that price.`
`I went to the storage room again... and got the shovel.`
`...It had been washed in the rain, but the paint was peeling, making it look unsightly.`
`...I never, ever wanted to touch this thing again.`
`The sensation of it in my hands was totally different from the night before... There was a ruthless coldness about it.`
`...Yeah.`
` ...It would be dark soon... so I'd need the lantern too...`
`There would be a little bit of light from the street lights... but it would get extremely dark.`
`"..................Uh."`
`I thought I'd put the lantern here, but I suddenly noticed it wasn't anywhere to be found.`
`...Then it hit me like a bolt of lightning.`
`......Of course.`
`...On that night... I hadn't brought the lantern back with me.`
`I'd left it at the place I buried the body.`
`...If I didn't go to get it soon, it would get very dark.`
`And then, not only would I be unable to find the spot I'd buried the corpse, but I wouldn't even be able to find the lantern itself.`
`If that happened... it was all over.`
`"...I need to hurry."`
`In order to fit the shovel in the basket on the front of my bike, I'd need to twist it and disassemble it.`
`But... it looked like there was dirt in the joints, and no matter how hard I pushed... it didn't want to come apart.`
`...After a strenuous effort, I realized I couldn't get it apart... so I decided to hold it in one hand and ride my bike with the other.`
`With the downpour soaking me through... and a shovel in one hand.`
` And riding one-handed.`
` ...It was as if... I'd returned to that night.`
`...No, 'return' was the wrong word.`
` ...It was more like... that night had never ended.`
`The pain of the raindrops striking me... were no different from then.`
`The thing that was different...... was Hinamizawa.`
` ...The world, and nothing else.`
`The rain clouds were already making it dark, and now was about time for the sun to set.`
`I could tell it would only get rapidly darker.`
`The straight road leading to town.`
` ...In the middle of it.`
`......That... should be where I buried it...`
` ......Yes.`
` ...It was near that street light...`
`On that night too... the water from the downpour was splashing down from the street light's overhang like a waterfall...`
`The pouring rain was exactly the same as it had been that night, and thus it brought my memories into focus.`
`I left my bike in the brush and stepped into the forest, the ground already soaked with mud.`
`...Where had I... buried him?`
` ...Think...`
`The darkness,`
` the shadows,`
` the water,`
` the mud.`
`...Everything was the same.`
`...Think...!`
`And then... I spotted the lantern by a fallen, moss-covered tree.`
`...That's right, I left it right there.`
`If I left the lantern here, then...`
` I would have buried him... over here.`
`With the sensation of standing in the sludge, my feet remembered the spot better than my eyes did.`
`I plunged my shovel into the ground.`
`...Ngh... it's hard.`
` ...It wasn't here.`
`...I just dug it up, so it should have been softer.`
`I stick my shovel down in a few spots... to test what they feel like...`
`One of them...... clearly felt deeper.`
`...I recalled where the lantern was, where the trees and things were in relation to each other... and knew that it had to be here...`
`...Under here... slept that man's corpse.`
`There would definitely be... the tattoo of a tiger on his back.`
`...But... if it wasn't there...`
`Then I... had made a horrible mistake... and killed someone completely unrelated instead.`
`...I would be more dazed at the fact that Satoko's uncle wasn't dead... than I would regret having gotten someone else mixed up in this...`
`If this insane world was punishment for the sin of committing murder...`
`I wouldn't be able to accept it until I'd killed Satoko's uncle for good.`
`And then... without any fear... I'd attack him again.`
`...And that time... I would kill him for sure.`
`But what... if the tattoo was there?`
`......That would mean I'd killed Satoko's uncle.`
`But... that would be terribly strange.`
`...If I'd killed him for sure... then who was the "uncle" at Satoko's house this very moment...?`
`......Impossible.`
`...I didn't even know anymore what I was using the word "impossible" to refer to.`
`I've used the word quite a few times today.`
`...If I had to make the words "impossible" fit just one thing... what would it be...?`
`...That much was obvious to me.`
`"...It would be impossible... for this crazy world to be real...!!"`
`I shouted, then turned behind me.`
` ...There was nobody there, of course.`
`...It hadn't been bothering me for a while... but those footsteps had followed me this entire day.`
`Even just now, an extra set of footsteps had splashed behind me.`
`No one was actually there—no indications of anyone, even.`
`...But... they were there.`
`"......Who are you?`
` ...You've been following me ever since I came to this world."`
`That's right.`
`Thinking back... the first time I heard those footsteps was after Takano-san and I had parted.`
`...Those footsteps... were my welcome into this strange, inside-out world.`
`"..........................."`
`No one could be there.`
`I'd get no response.`
`...Whoever it was, they just kept staring at me.`
` ...It wasn't ominous, just unpleasant.`
`...After staring into empty space for a bit, as I bathed in the rain, my illogical anger slipped away...`
`My tension loosened... and a tired feeling reared its head.`
`...I tasted this feeling that night too.`
`...The sudden exhaustion I felt as the tension in my brain loosened.`
`My vision quickly narrowed, and I felt like everything around me had suddenly gotten darker.`
`...I couldn't... give into this sensation.`
`I would light what little explosives were left in my brain and force myself to keep going.`
`I needed to dig that man up... before my stamina ran out.`
` ...I needed to see the tattoo on his back......`
`I caught my suddenly ragged breath and calmed down.`
`...Then, I stuck the shovel into the soft, muddy ground again.`
`It felt exactly the same as that night.`
`...The sense of digging a hole in the beach, with water coming into it with every wave.`
`...What day was today?`
`Had I... gone back to the night of Watanagashi...?`
`...Every strange thought that came to mind tormented me.`
`...Given my exhaustion, I didn't think I could manage to hold those thoughts back.`
`Once the hole was deep... all illumination finally faded, blanketing my vision in jet black.`
`...It was probably the moment the sun had fully set, too.`
`That night, I had feared the worst, and gone without using much light.`
`...My senses were so strained that I could see even in that darkness.`
`...But now... I didn't have that kind of strength left.`
`...I drained everything I had last night, and now the darkness would be lethal...`
`...I decided to turn on the lantern.`
` ...Putting it on the first setting would make it give off a faint light.`
`Even with how little there was, it was enough... and people wouldn't be able to see it from far away in this rain...`
`I grabbed the chilled lantern, turned the dial with a click, set it to the weakest light setting... and turned it on.`
`An uncanny world of silhouettes... appeared before me.`
`...A complex and strange shadowy world, created by the intricate entanglement of trees and branches.`
`I had only turned on a light... and it was like... that was all it took to make the world into something else.`
`...I let out a quick, tired breath, and wiped the liquid, neither rain nor sweat, from my brow...`
` Then I raised the shovel into the air... and slammed it into the mud.`
`That moment.`
` ......The silhouettes surrounding me... ominously all moved at once...`
`"...........Uh............"`
`Inside my head... something packed in there, something coarse but not hot or cold... was loudly rushing about.`
`The silhouettes were all around me... looking down at me.`
`And one of them, a silhouette bigger than the others... stepped forward.`
`".........Good evening.`
` ......Nfu-fu-fu-fu, the moon sure is beautiful tonight."`
`The coarseness in my brain shot through my whole spine... and left me at my waist.`
`...The strength in my body all left me through my hips... and I crouched down with a splash... into the sea of mud I'd dug myself...`
`".........O...... Ooishi........."`
`"...Is that really how you address your elders?`
` ...You'll have a rough time of it once you become an adult.`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu...!"`
`It wasn't only Ooishi, but five or six of them in a row... men wearing raincoats..`
`I had no inkling... that this many people had gotten so close.`
`It was like... once I turned on the lantern... they just appeared there... sliding out of the shadows...`
`"...Please, don't mind us.`
` Just think of us as... trees in the forest, perhaps."`
`...............Don't mind... them...?`
`"Yes.`
` Pay no attention to us—please, continue digging your hole."`
`"......Uh..............."`
`"It's very late, and raining very hard.`
` And you're working pretty fervently.`
` We won't get in your way!`
` Please, dig to your heart's content.`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu."`
`No thank you, I said...`
`When I tried to get up and turn around, two men blocked that route.`
`...They stood on either side of me and lifted me up with amazing strength... then threw me into the sea of mud.`
`As I... soaked in the mud bath I'd dug for myself... I looked up at the silhouettes looking down at me...`
`Ooishi squatted, picked up my shovel, and threw it at my feet for me.`
`...It bounced loudly off the mud and hit me in the face.`
`"...Come.`
` ...Please, continue.`
` Continue."`
`I couldn't bear the oppressiveness of the silhouettes surrounding me... and slowly, I stuck the shovel into the mud again.`
`...I felt like I was... digging my own grave.`
`If I kept digging... it wouldn't matter whether there was a tattoo or not... because that man's corpse would appear eventually.`
`...It was... all over.`
` ...Surrounded on all sides, and nowhere to go.`
`But... I just couldn't figure it out, no matter how much I thought about it.`
`...Why... were they here?`
`............Was it Takano-san...?`
`There was only one person... who could have made the connection between me and this place.`
`...Shit...... I knew it... She deserved to die...!!`
`"...Stopping so soon?"`
`"...Agh...!!"`
`Bam!`
` ...Ooishi kicked me in the back, which took me by surprise, sending me flying into the mud...`
`"...Hurry up and dig, please.`
` You really should consider the fact that some of us are standing out here in the rain."`
`".........Fuck you...`
` If you don't like the rain... then just go home...`
` ...Grah!"`
`Ooishi kicks some mud into my face.`
`"...Use your hands, please, not your mouth.`
` Only in the red-light district do they use both at once.`
` ...Isn't that right, boys?"`
`...The men around him didn't react, not knowing quite whether they should laugh... but when Ooishi glared at them... they started mumbling out pained chuckles.`
`...Just who... who was this guy...`
`I knew the world had changed after that night...`
`But if I went even further back... didn't it start when this guy showed up?`
` ...That was when our peaceful days had been taken from us.`
`...Ever since he showed up in Hinamizawa...... things had been odd.`
`...Everyone stopped smiling... and the world went crazy...`
`".........Hah...... hah...... ngh..."`
`The ground under my feet gradually got harder and heavier.`
`...At this point... even I started to think something was odd.`
`...I hadn't... buried him this deep on that night, had I...?`
`My exhaustion peaked... and I sat down on the spot.`
`"...How long... do you want me to dig......"`
`"...Kids these days have no stamina.`
` ......Hey, you."`
`At Ooishi's gesture, the men all pulled out their own sinister-looking shovels.`
`As I watched adaze, one of them grabbed my collar, dragged me out of the hole, and threw me to the ground.`
`The rest of the men stepped into the hole I dug and started shoveling themselves...`
`...As I stared at them, dumbfounded, Ooishi sauntered over... and squatted down to look at me directly.`
`"...Keiichi Maebara-san.`
` Is this a hobby of yours—digging holes on rainy nights?"`
`".................."`
`When I didn't respond, Ooishi took one of the tin buckets they were using to bail out the muddy water, scooped up some of it... and splashed the whole thing in my face.`
`"......*cough*... *cough*... *cough*...!!"`
`"...The rain's heavy today, too.`
` No matter how wet I get, I still don't understand the appeal!"`
`Ooishi smiled to himself, then scooped up another bucketful of muddy water.`
`"...I'll ask you again.`
` Is digging holes on rainy nights your hobby?"`
`"......Who the hell... would have a hobby like that?"`
`Splash!!`
`Ooishi hit me with another bucketful of muddy water.`
` ...The pebbles in it stung.`
`"Will there be something in that hole?`
` I've always liked that story, you know—about the old man who could make plants bloom, and the puppy digging in his yard for gold."`
`As he spoke, he ran the bucket through the muddy water again.`
` ...To splash it in my face again.`
`"...What kind of treasure is buried down there, hmm?`
` Can't you at least give me a hint?`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu...!"`
`...If you want to know... then dig on your own time.`
` ...You... fucking pig...!!`
`I wasn't saying that out loud... but Ooishi mercilessly drenched me in muddy water again anyway.`
`...Shit... shit... shit...!!`
`If only... if only you hadn't shown up, the world wouldn't have gone wrong...!!`
`Ever since you showed up... things have been strange.`
`Satoko got abused by her uncle... I ended up killing him... and the world went crazy...`
`He was how it all began.`
` ...Because of this culprit...!`
`He splashed another bucket of mud in my face.`
`...My insides were seething with anger.`
`...Die... You... You die too!!`
`If I have some strange power to kill someone by cursing them, like with Takano-san... then you're dead!!`
`And it won't be Oyashiro-sama's curse, it'll be mine... I'll curse you and kill you...!!`
`"What a rebellious look you're wearing.`
` Why don't we use this opportunity to teach you a thing or two in that regard? `
`We really do live in peace these days.`
` When I was about your age, corporal punishment was the norm for everything—"`
`"...Ooishi-san."`
`One of the digging men in raincoats wiped some sweat off and called Ooishi over.`
`Ooishi tossed the bucket away, then turned around with an evil grin on his face.`
`"...Yes, what is it?"`
`"Please, look at this..."`
`.........`
`...Acceptance, or maybe resignation.`
`...I wanted to say to them... "So you blockheads finally found it."`
`Yeah... That's right, I'm the one who killed him.`
`...But you're the police, so it's your own job to figure out who he is, right...?`
`Come on, prove to me that he's really Satoko's uncle...`
`"...What on earth?"`
`"We think it's an old drain pipe.`
` ...It seems to be connected to the irrigation channel over there."`
`"...Let's smash the thing.`
` It's not being used, is it?"`
`The men all exchanged glances... then hesitantly broached another topic.`
`"Ooishi-san...`
` The ground down there is pretty hard.`
` I don't think anything could be deeper than this."`
`"...Did we get the location wrong?"`
`"...No... At first, it definitely felt like the place had been dug up before.`
` But after digging so far, the ground suddenly hardened.`
` ...We think we've gone down further than the hole that was originally dug."`
`"...So... what does that mean?`
` There was a hole here, and someone filled it back up?`
` ...Is that what you're trying to tell me?"`
`.....................What...?`
` ...What were they... talking about......?`
`"Nah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...`
` Well, well... I'm at a loss.`
` Aren't you?`
` Maebara-san?"`
`Ooishi grabbed my collar and dragged me to the huge hole they dug...`
`The mud inside was like an ocean, and I couldn't see any drain pipe down there.`
`One of the men stirred it with a shovel, letting me hear it clang against something hard.`
`...There was no doubt I'd buried him right here.`
`But I hadn't buried him this deep.`
`...I didn't dig deep enough to unearth an entire drain pipe.`
`...So...`
` ......then.........`
` this man, his corpse...... where was it...`
`Proof... proof that I'd been successful on that night.........`
` was gone.`
` ...Gone.`
` Gone.`
`Then... what...... what on earth was I...`
`...Was I actually crazy after all... and just possessed by the delusion that I'd killed someone...?`
`That couldn't be.`
` ...It was the unmistakable truth.`
` It couldn't have been a hallucination.`
`But now...... the most important evidence... that it hadn't been an illusion... was gone.`
`I killed him.`
` I buried him.`
`...I had... absolute, unwavering confidence in that fact.`
`...Then...... did I fail to kill him......?`
`After I left here... had he started breathing again... crawled out... and gone back to Satoko's house? Was that it?`
`......I had come here to see...`
`Whether he had a tattoo or not.`
` ...And yet... the truth I unearthed... was far more than that.`
`I... yesterday... what was I...`
`I killed him.`
` I buried him!!`
` There was no doubt...!!`
`But... for some reason he lived, and crawled back out!`
`And that... was... impossible too!!`
`Agh, I'm so tired of hearing the word "impossible" over and over...`
` I get it, I get it...!`
`Dead people don't like to play by the rules here in Hinamizawa.`
`...Then... I'll kill you as many times as I need to...`
`I'll keep killing you... until you never show your face to Satoko again...!!`
`Ooishi and the others were muttering to each other.`
` ...Eventually, their conversation ended, and Ooishi came towards me.`
`...What did he want to say?`
` ...What did he want to do?`
`...I stiffened, tensing up...... and then, Ooishi just ignored me like I wasn't even there, and passed right by me.`
`The other men, too... they ignored me and shuffled away.`
`Eventually... there was no longer a sign that anyone was around... and I returned to my quiet world of silhouettes.`
`The only one left there was me.`
`...Only the sound of the pouring rain filled up the silence...`
