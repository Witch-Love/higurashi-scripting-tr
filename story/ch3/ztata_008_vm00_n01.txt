`"Because he's a good-for-nothing parasite.`
` ...If Satoko's that important, then there wouldn't be any reason to torment her, would there...?"`
`He only even came back because he broke up with the woman he was staying with.`
`"......Is it... really bad...?"`
` We'd need a lot of circumstantial evidence, but isn't this abuse?`
` ...And can't we talk to the region's welfare people about this?"`
` To the child consultation center.`
`"The welfare officer apparently went to visit on the same day each week for a while. `
` ...This means... we need to sit quietly and wait for him to be violent towards Satoko-chan and leave a mark, don't we?"`
` ...Don't kids with no guardians... have to go to orphanages and stuff...?"`
` That's how Rika-chan avoids being sent to an orphanage.`
`The one who brought an end to those terrible days... was some crazy drug addict nobody knew.`
`I handed my supermarket bag over to Satoko.`
`...And then, I noticed on the back of Satoko's hand...`
` there was something that looked like a bruise.`
`"...Hey, Satoko... What's... what the heck is that bruise?!"`
`...I knew as much as anyone else how transparent that sounded.`
`...I didn't need to hear it from Satoko... to know how this bruise... came to be.`
`"......I just slipped on the stairs and hit it a little.`
` Please, pay it no mind."`
`"...Satoko-chan probably... thinks of this abuse as a trial."`
`"Because Satoko-chan's reason for living is to wait at that house for Satoshi-kun to return.`
` ......She was a husk, an empty shell after being abandoned by her brother... How did she find her reason to live? `
`"...If... If I feel that Satoko is really in danger... I will report it without asking anyone's opinion. `
