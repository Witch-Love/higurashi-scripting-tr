`Mion and the others, having to set up for the Watanagashi Festival or something, invited me along, but I refused.`
`...Of course I did.`
`How could they be taking it easy and setting up for a festival in this situation?`
` Mion had a lot of nerve.`
`The first thing I did when I got back was take a shower.`
`Not because I wanted to wash off sweat.`
` ...It was because I wanted to be even calmer.`
`I already understood this, but killing that man would be so very easy.`
`...The really hard thing would be not getting arrested for it, so we could get our peaceful days back.`
`As I thought about it, I realized it wasn't easy.`
`...Japan's police force have the highest arrest rate in the world.`
`I would need to deceitfully pull off the perfect crime... and it couldn't be a half-hearted attempt.`
`...Still, it wasn't 100%.`
`Even the best police force in the world couldn't have a 100% arrest rate.`
`...I've read a lot of articles on trials with people brought up on false charges.`
`...At court they consider whether the charges are false or not, but figuring out the real criminal is entirely out of scope.`
`And that meant... perfect crimes did exist.`
`In fact, perfect crimes were sort of like works of art.`
`They could even be respected and revered.`
`You just had to look at the inundation of mystery novels everywhere throughout history.`
`They dealt with all sorts of difficult-to-solve incidents, involving secret rooms and alibis and stuff, but they all wanted to show one thing.`
` ...They wanted to show the beauty of a perfect crime.`
`There was something divine... in the flawlessness of the word "perfect."`
` Yes.`
` Perfect crimes were skills of the gods.`
`...And in that sense... the serial freak deaths they were calling the curse of Oyashiro-sama...`
` I understood—they must have been the works of gods.`
`Each one appeared to have been resolved, but they couldn't stop it from happening every year.`
`...Yeah—skills belonging only to gods, those are perfect crimes.`
`And I would be setting up my own crime before Oyashiro-sama's series of perfect crimes four years in the running.`
`...If I were to put it boldly, I was challenging a god.`
`Foolhardiness would be needed to make the decision... but I needed to be calm, cool, colder than ice to put that plan together.`
`Kill him like a flame.`
`But as systematic as ice.`
`Starting now, I need to retain both of those ideas within me...`
`Modeling my crime after a mystery novel wasn't actually a bad thing to focus on.`
`Sometimes, kidnappings involving disturbing, original methods that made it into the newspaper were used as a basis for novels after the person was arrested... Stuff like that made it into the news.`
`Day and night, for a very long time, mystery novel authors polished and refined their most fantastic artistic crimes.`
`...Imitating that could be a shortcut to planning the perfect crime in a short period of time.`
`Of course, I haven't read enough mystery novels to act all high and mighty about them.`
`...The one who really liked mystery novels...`
` was my mom.`
`She'd read every well-known mystery novel from overseas, from past and present.`
` Every time she watched mystery shows, she would always criticize them as having cheap tricks or being poorly thought-out. `
`...I wonder... what the perfect crime would mean to her...`
`"What do I think the most well-done perfect crime in all the mystery novels I've read is?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` Well, you read quite a lot of them, right?`
` I figured you might know a lot about them."`
`"It's more fun to read them to find out.`
` If I told you all the tricks right off the bat, they'd be no fun anymore."`
`...It wasn't like I was asking for my own amusement.`
`...She was deflecting the question, so I would somehow butter her up first and draw out an answer...`
`"Of course, Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' is my top recommendation.`
` And 'Murder on the Orient Express' used some great, bold tricks too, of course. I didn't see it coming at all."`
`"...I didn't want to know which novels you liked.`
` I wanted to know about the trick that made you the most surprised."`
`"If it was really a perfect trick, the detectives wouldn't be able to solve the case, though."`
`...That was true.`
` ...Then there'd be no point.`
`"Mystery novels are enjoyable because of the process of the mysteries getting solved.`
` If it was unsolvable, it wouldn't make a very good topic for a novel..."`
`"...I get it.`
` ...Yeah, you're right.`
` If the main character can't solve it... it wouldn't be much of a story, huh..."`
`Was I being too simplistic?`
`...A mystery novel was basically a game.`
`They were written so that you can get to the goal, so that you could solve them.`
`But I couldn't use something so optimistic.`
`...It needed to be the be-all end-all of tricks so that we could, without a doubt, return to our old lives.`
`"By the way, Keiichi.`
` ...Do you understand that truly perfect crimes don't even become stories?"`
`Mom looked at me intellectually and grinned impishly.`
`...I'd never gotten to read it, but apparently one time a long time ago, Mom had written her own mystery novel and submitted it for some mystery novel award.`
` ...Apparently she was really into it.`
`Don't even become stories? What does that mean...?`
`"Keiichi, what are the essential parts of a story?"`
`"A beginning, a middle, and an end?"`
`"Correct.`
` The beginning, of course, is especially important.`
` If there is no beginning, then the story never starts."`
`"Well, yeah.`
` ...If nothing happened, nothing would begin."`
`"Right.`
` Nothing happened, so there wouldn't even be an incident.`
` Detectives wouldn't be called, so there wouldn't be any mystery.`
` There would be no mystery, so there would be no solution. `
`...In other words, it would be the ultimate perfect crime."`
`"......Wait...`
` ...Wait a second.`
` ...Could you explain that again...?!"`
`My mom... just told me something absurd.`
`...And she was saying it so smoothly, too, so I kind of tuned her out... but...`
` She said something extremely important just now.`
`"It's not really that difficult to understand.`
` ...The incident just has to never come to light, that's all."`
`"...Just has to...`
` never come to light."`
`"For example... Hmm, how about this?`
` Say there's an old man living deep in a forest nobody goes into."`
`"Uh-huh..."`
`"And one day, the old man gets killed by an axe.`
` ...And, hmm... Let's say the criminal was the old man's son. `
`He went to the old man's house and they were drinking together, but they got into a fight and he killed him."`
`...What an extremely cheap plot.`
`It was an impulsive crime, without a bit of planning.`
` It was pretty far from a perfect crime...`
`"But Keiichi.`
` The house was really, really deep in this forest.`
` So deep in the mountains that nobody would ever go out that far.`
` ...Then his son would go back to town and say...`
` that the old man was doing fine."`
`"...What about that is a perfect crime?"`
`"Keiichi.`
` ...This incident would only begin when it was found out that the old man was killed.`
` ...If nobody ever visited the old man's house after that, that beginning would never occur."`
`...The beginning would never occur...`
`"So basically, the story wouldn't start.`
` The incident wouldn't come to light, and they wouldn't call in detectives.`
` And nobody would be suspicious in the first place, so there'd be no mystery. `
`...They'd think the old man was still living by himself deep in the forest...`
` And the old man's face would appear in the sky, and that would be it.`
` ...Something like that, you know?"`
`"...That... That's amazing...!!`
` That's a pretty great trick!"`
`"But it wouldn't be a novel.`
` Mystery novels are for entertainment, after all.`
` They can't be instruction manuals for perfect crimes."`
`...I was trying hard to talk cheerfully to fool her... but inside I was excited.`
`Special tools, strange geography, mysterious drugs, traps involving huge sums of cash... None of them were needed for perfect crimes.`
`The important thing... was that there wasn't a beginning.`
` ......As long as the incident didn't come to light... it would be fine.`
`Speaking broadly...`
`If I could kill him without anyone finding out...`
`And dispose of the corpse somewhere no one could find...`
` It would basically already be a perfect crime.`
`...Of course, if someone up and vanished one day all of a sudden, people would get suspicious.`
`...But that didn't apply to this man.`
`Last year, after their aunt died, he ran away from the village in fear of Oyashiro-sama.`
`When the night of Watanagashi came around again, everyone would have to think... that he ran away in fear again.`
`I mean, he had been living with a lover of his in town.`
`No matter what it felt like when he vanished, no one would be suspicious.`
`People hated him, after all.`
` ...No one would care where he went if he disappeared...!!`
`When I thought about it like that, it got easier and easier to imagine killing him.`
`There was no point in thinking inside my house anymore.`
`I left, getting my bike out of the garage.`
`...For now... it didn't matter where I was going.`
`I just rode through the wind, trying to calm my excitement by feeling the cool air on my body.`
`...Where I'd kill him, how I'd do it,`
` what time,`
` and how to dispose of the corpse.`
`...If I just had those four things... I could get a good plan going.`
`I was so surprised at how little there was to decide that I shivered.`
`...I'd been completely prepared to build this humongous plan over a really long period of time...`
` ...But if I could just get these little things in order... I could put it into motion.`
`Today was Saturday.`
`...I would have to kill him on the night of Watanagashi... so as long as I was standing in for Oyashiro-sama, I only had twenty-four hours remaining.`
`...Satoko.`
` ...Just hang on... for twenty-four more hours.`
`I can't even imagine... having to suffer through even more... but please, hold out for a little longer.`
`I know you can't even last another second... I know that...`
`But please... just hold out...`
` ...Your Nii-nii... will save you for sure...`
`Outside, it was still early enough for the cicadas to be crying.`
`...Early afternoon.`
` ...Evening was still a long way off.`
`...I looked at the sky—at some point it had gotten cloudy.`
`Come to think of it, as I left the house, I heard on the TV that the weather forecast was calling for a chance of rain on Sunday...`
`The sky was the color of lead.`
`...If I heard a little bit of thunder, I'd definitely have expected a sudden evening shower.`
`...My first destination was school.`
`Before explaining why I was going there, I needed to explain what method for killing that man I had decided upon.`
`...I decided that the most suitable death, the one I needed to give him...`
` ...was the same as last year's curse.`
` ...The same as the punishment their aunt had received... being beaten to death.`
`Wouldn't beating him to death be somewhat unreliable...?`
`You may think that stabbing him with a blade... would be more reliable.`
`But this was something I had chosen after a lot of thought.`
`...You just needed to think realistically.`
` The law... It prohibited carrying any blades longer than 10 centimeters, I think.`
`...So the blades available to me, even the longest ones, were still limited to things shorter than a ruler.`
`...You can probably understand how tricky it would be with such a short reach to go up against an opponent that might fight back.`
`In that case, a weapon with more reach, like a staff, would be far more advantageous.`
`It might not be quite as inherently lethal, but since you could just keep hitting the guy until you killed him, the end result was the same.`
`So, what's a staff-like deadly weapon, terrifyingly powerful, and also eminently portable?`
`...By this point, you should immediately think of a metal baseball bat.`
`I don't need to explain... how terrifying a metal baseball bat can be as a weapon.`
`Of special note is the fact that you can carry one around in broad daylight and not be thought of as suspicious.`
`......Just those two points would have been enough to choose a metal bat for my weapon...`
` but there was one more reason...`
` for choosing a metal bat in particular.`
` I will speak about it later.`
`After school that Saturday, my classmates were still having fun, playing in the schoolyard.`
`I could show up there and it would be the same as always, so nobody will think I'm suspicious.`
`...Getting my hands on the weapon without looking suspicious was actually a factor I couldn't ignore.`
`...I didn't normally play baseball, so if I went to a sports store looking for a metal bat... it would definitely be suspicious.`
`...I can't let there be a beginning to the story... so I needed to be really careful even about that.`
`That left school.`
`...At a location at which my appearance wouldn't be suspicious... I would acquire the weapon.`
`I checked inside the classroom through the window... but of course, there was nobody there.`
`The only students who would stay in there were me and the others, when doing club activities.`
`...Without us, the classroom after school was just an empty, unused room.`
`...Without glancing around nervously... as if I'd just gone to get something I'd forgotten, I casually went in the entrance.`
`......It looked like the teacher was busy with paperwork in the teacher's lounge.`
`I didn't see her in the hallway.`
`...Naturally, yet quickly as a shadow... I entered the classroom.`
`The empty room was full of a strange, stagnant air that you couldn't feel normally.`
`...An empty classroom... with nobody here.`
`...Maybe while no one was around... the desks creep about of their own accord, licking the floors clean of dirt.`
` ...If I suddenly stepped into a place like that... `
`Would the desks, in their surprise, fly at me, crush my bones, and eat me alive...?`
`"......That's ridiculous."`
`I felt regret at wasting valuable thinking time on stupid delusions.`
`...The students' lockers were lined up in the back of the classroom.`
`The one I was looking for... wasn't my own.`
` ...It was...`
` a forbidden locker......`
` one I had accidentally discovered one day.`
`"...Here it is... Houjou...`
` ...This has to be it."`
`...If one person has one locker, then why would only Satoko have two?`
` I'd made a fuss about it once.`
`...After that... I learned it was Satoshi's locker, and he had the same last name as her.`
`...But of course, even though it was a locker for a student no longer here... looking inside it was still a shameless act.`
`...But one time... I let my curiosity get the better of me and took a peek inside...`
`Inside, it was average and worthless... At the time, I hadn't been interested, so until now I'd forgotten what had been in it.`
`...But now that I had—dare I say it—awakened...`
` I remembered...`
` the thing...`
` that had been there.`
`Scrr...ape...`
`I opened the locker... and a stench of mold and sweat wafted out, like a gym storehouse that hadn't been cleaned in weeks.`
`...My face puckered up at the stench... but I looked for it.`
`Yes.`
`......Satoshi was on Coach's baseball team.`
`...Inside the locker was a Hinamizawa Fighters uniform......`
` and it.`
`...The one Satoshi used... the metal bat...`
`Yes.`
` ...This was the reason I wanted to choose this bat.`
`...This murder would be carried out by me... but this wasn't originally my role... it was Satoshi's.`
`...But I would stand in for him and call myself Satoko's nii-nii.`
`...It was one of the rules... for standing in for him.`
`I reached for the metal bat... and grasped it firmly.`
`...It was light.`
`...And yet... its tip had enough heft in it... enough to easily imagine the horror if I brought it down with all my might.`
`...Satoshi.`
` ...I'll give you one last chance to save your sister.`
`...Lend me your strength.`
`...You're a coward, but I will stand in for you.`
`...So if you still care even a little bit about her... you will... lend me your strength.`
`There is no more suitable weapon in the world for putting that man to death than your bat.`
`Now... I just needed to figure out where to hide it.`
`...Tomorrow, before the act, I would just stop by the school and grab it.`
`...Because I couldn't ignore the possibility someone would see me bringing it home and think it was strange.`
`But if I left it here, there wouldn't be a problem.`
`Plus, tomorrow was Sunday.`
` Not only that... it was the day of the biggest festival in the whole village.`
`...Nobody would be coming to school.`
`I left out the entrance... and went over to a construction vehicle parked nearby.`
`We'd been warned by our teacher not to touch it just for laughs, so none of the kids would come near the vehicle either.`
`...They wouldn't, because if she found out they touched it, they'd be in huge trouble.`
`I quietly hid it...`
` in the shadow... of the vehicle.`
`...The chances of someone operating the vehicle tomorrow were slim to none.`
`...Because tomorrow was Sunday.`
`Government workers had the day off.`
`...And... from what my classmates had said, the thing had been left here for years now.`
` ...Machines that haven't been moved in years... You can't just suddenly start them up again. `
`...So I was almost definitively fine in this case.`
`...The sunlight was piercingly hot. My head grew faint for a moment.`
`Had the heat... been this harsh for the entire day...?`
`A moment of dulled thoughts like this... was a moment of carelessness.`
` ...I gave myself a couple hits in the head, then looked around warily...`
`.....................`
`...Okay.`
` ......Next... how to dispose of the corpse.`
