`"............Give it a fucking rest..."`
`Keiichi squeezed out those words.`
`He sounded good.`
` Like he was about to bite me.`
`"Awake at last, are we?`
` I lied before, you know.`
` ...About having wanted to give Shion the most miserable death of all, but locking her up because I hadn't thought of a good way yet.`
` That was a lie."`
`I smiled as I laid out the huge nails and hammer specially made for the nail table.`
`"I'll let her hear the screams of all those people that died because of her, and after they've soaked in to her very soul, then I'll kill her...`
` ...I've got pretty good taste, huh?`
` Heh heh heh heh!!"`
`"............Who......`
` are you?"`
`"Hah?`
` I'm Mion.`
` Mion Sonozaki.`
` Have you lost your mind from fear?`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`".........No, you're not.`
` ...There's... no way you can be Mion Sonozaki...!"`
`I stopped moving.`
`.........Kei-chan...?`
`Shit.`
` I'd decided the naming game would be over once we reached Shion's cell.`
`Therefore, even if he guessed this time, it would be too late.`
`Oh well...`
` Sure,`
` I'll listen to you.`
` This is your last chance.`
`"...I see.`
` Then if I'm not Mion, who am I?"`
`Come on, Kei-chan.`
` ...Guess who I am.`
` Why don't you try and save Mion, the girl who fell in love with you?`
`".........`
`A demon."`
`"Huh?"`
`"............You're not Mion.`
` ...Mion was just here. Give her back."`
`"...Kei-chan, is your brain really doing okay?`
` You're not going crazy with fear?"`
`"Don't touch me!!!`
` ...You damn demon...!!!`
` Give her back!!`
` Give Mion back!!!`
` My best friend... Give Mion baaaaaaack!!!"`
`I listened to him with a blank expression.`
`"...I know it's nonsense... to demand Mion's return when she's right in front of me.`
` But... but...!`
` This person in front of me... can't possibly be Mion!!!`
` I can't accept that...!!"`
`Aha, ahahahahahahaha...`
`That's great, ahahahahahaha!`
`So I'm not Mion or Shion...`
`He doesn't even see me as my sister...`
`No, wait, that's not it.`
`Keiichi protected the Mion in his heart until the end.`
`He didn't accept the fact that Mion was a murderer.`
` And not just that, either.`
`He protected the Shion in his heart as well.`
`He didn't conclude that if Mion wasn't a murderer, then it must have been Shion.`
`To Keiichi, Shion was someone who always made fun of Mion.`
`But that was it.`
` It wasn't like they'd known each other for a long time.`
`But Keiichi protected her.`
` He protected Shion from being a murderer.`
`Ahahahahaha... that's why I'm a demon, and not Mion or Shion, huh?`
`A demon, huh?`
` A demon... ahahahahaha, that's stupid!`
`Hahahahaha.`
` But isn't that just right on the money?`
`Ahahahahaha, ahahahahahahaha!!`
`"Wahh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!`
` ...Kei-chan... Are you trying to drown me in my own tears...?`
` Wahhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`However, Keiichi didn't back off.`
`He kept screaming.`
` He screamed loudly, so that I could hear his voice even when I was stuck inside of a demon.`
`"You can do it, Mion...!`
` Don't... lose to this piece of shit demon...!!!`
` You're strong... Show me how strong you aaaareee!!!"`
`"Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!`
` Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`Surely he isn't talking to me knowing that I'm the real Mion, right?`
`He's just confusing us again.`
`So there's no reason to let my heart be disturbed by Keiichi's screams toward Mion!`
`"Come on... Mion...!!!`
` Mion!!`
` Why... did you lose to a demon like this?!`
` You're not that weak, are you?!`
` Don't give up...`
` Fight...`
` Fight!!!"`
`He's right, I didn't fight back... How did he know?`
`How did he know I didn't fight back?`
`I lost to the demon.`
`After all, I'm weak. I'm not strong enough to defeat the demon!!`
`Even so, Keiichi continued to talk to Mion.`
`His voice had become hoarse, and he had begun sobbing.`
` He kept mumbling,`
` Mion,`
` Mion...`
`".........Kei-chan.`
` ...This may not be... something pleasant to take to the grave with you.`
` .........But you really seem to want to know, so I'll tell you just one thing.`
`......A long time ago, the demon came to live inside me.`
` ...It was gnawing at my heart, trying to spur me to violence, but...`
` I suppressed it with my reason. `
`...The demon had become quiet... and I got to thinking it had gone away somewhere.`
` ...As it turned out, I was wrong.`
` ......It hadn't left... it was just sleeping inside me."`
`That was the truth.`
`When I learned about Satoshi-kun's disappearance, my weak soul couldn't take the sadness, and anger filled me to the brim.`
`But the insanity had stopped there.`
`Time had healed me... and embraced me with memories of Satoshi-kun.`
`"...The demon... woke up again due to a certain, small opportunity.`
` ......What do you think... that opportunity was...?"`
`It was such a little thing.`
`".........`
`This might be strange for me, a demon, to say, but...`
` ...You're the reason that everything got so messed up."`
`A tear rolled down my cheek.`
`"............At the time...`
` if you had given me that doll you got, without hesitation.........`
` maybe everything wouldn't have gotten so twisted.`
` ...You probably can't understand.`
` I wouldn't expect you to. `
`...But, you see, all sorts of things started falling over like dominoes after that... and soon it was too much for me to control. `
`...It only makes sense that you wouldn't be aware of knocking over the first one, since it was so small......`
` but you're the one who set them up."`
`If Kei-chan hadn't done something so insensitive, Shion wouldn't have cried.`
`Shion cried`
` and talked to me about it.`
`That had reminded me of Satoshi-kun.`
`I became jealous of her for having someone she loved so close to her.`
`It was a very small jealousy.`
`But that little feeling woke up the demon who was sleeping deep inside of me.`
`After that, I just let the demon take over.`
`The demon ate up all of the sadness from my loss of Satoshi-kun,`
` and filled my heart with the notion of revenge, even though I knew that wouldn't make Satoshi-kun happy.`
`Then, the scary incidents that followed dragged me to Hell, from whence there was no escape.`
`"...That... that can't... be, can it...?"`
`".........It only makes sense that you wouldn't be aware of it.`
` Even so, Kei-chan, you are without a doubt the cause.`
` .........If you had nonchalantly given me the doll that day...`
` then I don't think this would have happened."`
`Was I simply transferring the blame to Keiichi?`
`Such a tiny thing woke up the demon inside of me...`
`The demon would have woken up eventually.`
`I was at fault.`
`I didn't fight back.`
` I let the demon live in my soul,`
` and I let the demon possess me.`
`"......Ooh...... ooh...!!"`
`Keiichi didn't hide his tears. They were pouring down his cheeks.`
`Maybe he was crying in my place, since I'd become a demon and couldn't cry of my own will.`
`"...Can I start now, then?`
` This method of torture is very simple.`
` I'll nail one of these into the first joint of your left pinky finger. `
`Then, I'll nail each one in order until I get to your thumb, and then I'll go back to your pinky and nail one into the joint in the middle.`
` ...So on and so on, until I hammer fifteen nails into your left hand.`
`When that's over with, I'll do your right hand next.`
` ...After that...... if you're still conscious, I'll tell you.`
` There are a lot of nerves bundled in your fingertips, so it hurts far more than you could imagine. `
`...Some people apparently pass out before you finish hammering thirty nails into their hands, so..."`
`I put a nail to Keiichi's left pinky.`
`Once I hit it with the huge hammer,`
` it would start`
` and it would be over.`
`".........I didn't hesitate at all when I was torturing the others,`
` but somehow I do when it's you."`
`".........If this will satisfy your demon, Mion...`
` If it will sate the demon, then do to me what you will..."`
`I didn't understand what he just said, so I tried to repeat his words in my head.`
`".........Are... you serious...?"`
`"...Compared to how much I hurt Mion... this is nothing, right?"`
`"............"`
`"...Do as much as you want.`
` ...In exchange... promise me two things.`
` .........After you're satisfied with causing me pain... forgive Shion. `
`...She's been punished enough to make up for her crime of sneaking into the storehouse, hasn't she?"`
`"You... After all this... you still care about Shion more than yourself...?"`
`I am Mion. Mion Sonozaki.`
`...So why are my eyes growing so damp when hearing Keiichi show concern for Shion...?`
`"...The other thing...`
` is that when you've had your fill... you disappear.`
` ......Give that body...`
` back to Mion.`
` ......`
`......That's all."`
`".........You know, you're...`
` Are you not even considering possibly begging for your life or anything?"`
`".........Can I ask you to promise three things instead of two?`
` ...The third is to leave me alive."`
`"...Ahahahahaha.`
` You said two in the beginning, didn't you?`
` ...So you can't have any more."`
`".........That's a shame..."`
`Even in this situation...`
` Keiichi and I`
` joked around and laughed...`
`Ah... then, I knew.`
` I knew why Shion fell in love with him.`
`He's different from Satoshi-kun`
` but`
` he's a good guy...`
`"...I probably won't keep these promises, understand?`
` I'm a demon, after all."`
`"I guess there's nothing I can do, then..."`
`Keiichi smiled and then closed his eyes.`
`"...Kei-chan.`
` I'll... agree to just the third thing, okay?"`
`".........Huh?"`
`"Your first wish.`
` To save Shion.`
` ...That's not possible`
` ...The demon will kill her.`
` ...It's already been decided, so I can't stop it.`
` So please give up on that."`
`I stroked Keiichi's chin.`
`"As for your second wish.`
` To give this body back to Mion.`
` ...That won't happen either.`
` ...After today, Mion will never come back.`
` ......From today on, even if my body remains, it will be just a shell... `
`...because the demon has taken it over."`
`".........That isn't true.`
` ...Mion is... Mion...!`
` Don't say such sad things... like that she won't ever come back...!"`
`"............`
`Can you hear it?`
` That sound."`
`I'd been hearing a noise.`
` I knew what it had to be.`
`......Baang.........`
` Baang...`
`A dull sound was repeating in a regular rhythm.`
` It was accompanied by a light tremor.`
`People were trying to force open the iron door to the underground storehouse.`
`"You're late, so Rena probably called Ooishi.`
` ...That spaced-out girl being so quick-thinking was the one thing I didn't anticipate."`
`".........I'll agree with you there."`
`Really?`
` I wonder how much Kei-chan really knows about Rena.`
`Rena Ryuugu...`
`I won this time.`
` Rena couldn't figure out who I was until the end.`
`........................`
`Or maybe she did.`
`Rena didn't seem confused about whether I was Mion or Shion.`
`Perhaps Rena could tell Mion and Shion apart through her sense of smell.`
` She was good at that kind of thing.`
`No way...`
` ...I'm overestimating her.`
`...........`
`I brought out my stun gun so Keiichi could see the sparks.`
`"......You've probably never seen one before, right?`
` It's a real stun gun.`
` ...It's illegally modified, and its power has been increased quite a bit."`
`"...Was that what you hit me with before?`
` ...That's not a toy children should be playing with, you know."`
`"Heh heh heh.`
` ...You're right."`
`Baang!`
`They must have broken the first door.`
`The path was complicated, but there was no other door except for the one to this torture room.`
`"...I won't kill you, but I will have you go to sleep for a bit, Kei-chan.`
` Ooishi will be here soon.`
` This will only hurt a bit."`
`Keiichi bit down and smiled bitterly.`
`I paused, hesitating a little.`
`Keiichi opened his eyes to see what was wrong.`
`"............I'm sorry...`
` for disgracing Mion."`
`"......I made a promise before coming in here.`
` Whatever happens, the Mion inside my heart won't change."`
`"............Look, forget about that.`
` If you ever see me after today...`
` don't come near me.`
` ...By then, it will be the demon... that inherited my corpse."`
`Bzzz!!`
`Keiichi fell unconscious.`
`I locked the door to the torture room.`
`I locked the door to the huge cave, too.`
`That should give me some time.`
`"Shion,`
` come on out."`
`I opened the cell and told Shion to leave it.`
`She was crying.`
`"You asked me to let Kei-chan go... so I did.`
` He's out cold, because of the stun gun.`
` The police should be here soon, so they'll set him free."`
`"Thank you...`
` Thank you...`
` Oooh..."`
`"You still have something more to do.`
` Shion has to escape from here."`
`I took Shion to the cell with the hidden passage.`
`"Before that,`
` I'll give Mion back to you."`
`"...Eh?"`
`"Take those clothes off.`
` We're switching again.`
` Here, the rubber band for your hair."`
`Shion had no idea what was going on, but she changed her clothes as I ordered her to.`
`I gave her the flashlight, and she hung it around her neck.`
`"You go first.`
` Find the hidden escape route at the bottom of the well."`
`The light from the flashlight wasn't enough to entirely illuminate the way down.`
`Nobody in their right mind would want to descend that well.`
`But Shion obeyed and timidly climbed down the ladder.`
`When she had passed entirely below the rim of the well, I brought out my stun gun and put it to Shion's head.`
`Shion understood the meaning of that.`
`".........Sis......"`
`"I didn't kill Kei-chan, just as you wanted.`
` You told me I could kill you instead, didn't you?`
` Heh heh heh, I'm going to keep our promise."`
`Shion's hands and feet were clinging to a very unstable ladder, so there was no way she could protect herself.`
`She was in a critical situation.`
`"You, who looks like Mion, need to fall into the bottom of the well and die.`
` I look like Shion.`
` Kei-chan will testify that I'm the victim.`
` I'll wait in the cell for the police to get here. `
`I'm sure they'll eventually find out the truth from our fingerprints,`
` but by the time they get that far, I'll be hiding somewhere else.`
` Pretty good, huh?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`"......Are you killing me`
` out of revenge`
` for Satoshi?"`
`"If you know that much, you should have been prepared.`
` Go apologize to Satoshi-kun at the bottom of the well."`
`"Sis... Satoshi isn't`
` at the bottom of the well..."`
`"Huh?`
` Didn't you say`
` the bodies get dumped down here?"`
`"All I said`
` was that if he was killed at the Sonozaki house`
` this is where his body would be..."`
`"What are you telling me now?`
` Can't you be a little clearer?"`
`"I...`
` also... ...liked`
` Satoshi..."`
`"...Yeah, I'm sure.`
` I liked him, after all."`
`"I was very sad... ...when Satoshi-kun disappeared`
` so I`
` looked into things..."`
`"..................And?"`
`"I interrogated Granny.`
` I even thought about throttling her.`
` Then she told me...`
` She said she was only telling me as the successor, so I had to keep it a secret."`
`What she said was something hard to believe.`
`The hag said to Shion:`
`The Sonozaki family had nothing to do with the disappearance of Satoshi-kun.`
`Shion couldn't understand, so she asked again.`
`The Sonozaki family held a lot of influence in the underworld because of our dad's connections. In fact, they used such illegal measures during the dam conflict.`
`Therefore, people just assumed the Sonozaki family had pulled the strings when the dam construction incident took place.`
`Even the hag laughed meaningfully and said suspicious things, so everyone believed she was the mastermind.`
`But... it was all a performance.`
` It was a hoax by the Sonozaki family head...`
`It was just a bluff. The family took credit for the incidents to make it look like they were pulling the strings.`
`With the influence they already had, this bluff was very believable.`
`Therefore, people thought of the Sonozaki family as one that had deep connections in the underworld, and that they were capable of producing any sort of conspiracy.`
`People have believed that since the dam conflict.`
`Oryou just smiled at things she had nothing to do with,`
` as if she was pulling the strings.`
`When the relatives saw that, they became fearful of Oryou's power.`
`When the dam construction site manager was killed...`
`Oryou smiled meaningfully.`
`When the relatives saw that, they assumed Oryou was behind it.`
`When the Houjou couple fell off the cliff...`
`When the Furude couple died violently...`
`When Satoshi-kun's aunt died and Satoshi-kun disappeared... the hag just smiled meaningfully.`
`Everyone believed the Sonozaki family was behind all those incidents.`
`"That... That's a lie!!`
` Are you trying to tell me the Sonozaki family had nothing to do with any of it?!`
` How can I believe that?"`
`"I don't think... Granny would lie...`
` Especially about Satoshi-kun's disappearance, since she said she knew nothing about it.`
` Because, Granny approved of the relationship between Satoshi-kun and you, remember? `
`You ripped your nails off so she would forgive everything."`
`"No, that's a lie!!`
` Don't try to fool me!!`
` Then who made Satoshi-kun disappear?!`
` Who?!!"`
`"That...... I don't know.`
` But it wasn't the Sonozaki family.`
` It wasn't Granny..."`
`"You know the curse system, right?`
` The hag didn't need to give the command for Satoshi-kun to be attacked. All she had to do was look concerned... and then someone else would take care of it. `
`That was the system!!"`
`"....................."`
`Shion couldn't say anything in response.`
`Even if the hag had forgiven him personally, as long as he was the object of the curse, the executioner would follow him forever.`
`"Granny told me that`
` she had tried to find out`
` who was actually behind this curse of Oyashiro-sama for a long time.`
` ...But she couldn't. `
`Everyone believed it was someone in the village, but she couldn't find out who it was."`
`"She couldn't find out?`
` Then why did the curse take place every year?"`
`"Isn't it weird?!`
` But... there wasn't anyone!`
` There really wasn't!"`
`"I told you that Rika Furude tried to attack me earlier with a syringe, didn't I?`
` How do you explain that?`
` She wasn't just acting out of desperation, like a cornered rat. `
`She came over to my house and attacked me with a bottle of pepper spray and a syringe.`
` I bet Tomitake-san was killed with that same stuff."`
`"......That... I don't know.`
` I can't believe Rika-chan would do`
` something like that..."`
`"I'm the one who saw how she died, and I still can't believe it.`
` What a completely abnormal way to go."`
`I don't think Shion and the hag are lying.`
`That would mean the hag wasn't in as much control as we thought she was, though.`
`She didn't know anything about that scary drug`
` or if the Furude family was the one executing the curse.`
`If the Sonozaki family had nothing to do with it, then who made the series of mysterious deaths possible?`
`Was it just a coincidence that something happened five years in a row on the night of Watanagashi?`
`That's impossible.`
`A human must have made it happen!`
`And it was all decided somewhere the Sonozaki family wasn't aware of.`
`The Kimiyoshi family didn't know anything.`
`Kimiyoshi believed the Sonozaki family was behind it.`
`Was it the Furude family?`
`With Rika's behavior, and the elderly people who believed in her so blindly...`
` Did some kind of power exist around the Furude family that created the curse?`
`No way.`
`The Furude couple themselves were victims of it.`
`How could a little girl like Rika possess a power stronger than that of the Sonozaki family?`
`No way, it's just impossible.`
`In other words, I had killed the heads of all the Three Families and was trying to bring an end to the whole thing, all as a result of a misunderstanding about the dark secret of Hinamizawa.`
`Then what about my revenge?`
`Did I kill all the wrong people, people who had nothing to do with Satoshi-kun's disappearance at all?`
`"Ha ha ha, that's good, Shion.`
` You're still trying to turn the tables on me, huh?"`
`"Sis, please... believe me...`
` I'm not... your enemy.`
` I really am not.`
` Please... believe me, Sis..."`
`Shion begged with tears in her eyes.`
`That would have affected me if I was still Shion's sister...`
`But I don't feel anything anymore`
` because I'm a demon.`
`I'll be done once I kill Shion.`
`I've already decided that.`
` If I don't finish it up, what would my existence be for?`
`What about the life I devoted to revenge for Satoshi-kun?`
`How dare she tell me all this nonsense to confuse me at the very end...`
`If what she said was the truth, then what I'd done wasn't revenge.`
`It was just the curse of the fifth year...`
`"...Shion.`
` If you are truly innocent, you can go to Heaven.`
` Apologize to Satoshi-kun for me..."`
`"Si-........."`
`A bluish-white spark lit up the darkness, and Shion disappeared into the well.`
`"Please apologize to Satoshi-kun in Heaven.`
` I can't, since I won't be going there..."`
`Instead, I'm going deep into Hell.`
`Jumping into this well would be too simple an atonement for what I've done.`
`Until I find a perfect way to end my life, I'm going to live`
` as best I can...`
