`"Hey, mom. Tell me.`
` Why did you have a fight with the hag?`
` It was bad enough that she disowned you, right?"`
`"You're so nosy about everything...`
` Well, I guess you're old enough to know.`
` She objected when I told her I wanted to marry your father."`
`"Eh? What?!"`
`"I was living a very unseemly life back then.`
` Then the man I brought home was a yakuza,`
` so of course she got terribly upset. `
`She said, 'the head of the family will choose your fiance,'`
` and I said, 'screw your decisions, you fucking virago!'`
` So then we both tried to cut each other down on the spot. `
`We unsheathed our katanas in the living room and clashed and slashed and sliced. `
`Aha ha ha ha!"`
`"Eeek...!`
` You fought that hag with a sword?!`
` Way to go, Mom..."`
`"Well,`
` I was into martial arts when I was young.`
` Both she and I held high ranks in kendo, so yes, it was quite the show.`
` Everyone nearby was terrified. Ah, that was fun."`
`"I see......`
` so is that why you were disowned?"`
`"That's right. I was happy for it!`
` I married your father right away.`
` Well, I was forced to remove my fingernails in atonement, though.`
` See how the fingernails of my left hand look ugly?"`
`"Wow...`
` So, that's why you and the hag have a bad relationship, huh...?"`
`"Ahahaha, you know what, Shion?`
` That's not actually true.`
` Our relationship is actually pretty good."`
`"...What?!`
` That can't be right!"`
`"She has to maintain the family's reputation,`
` so she can't treat me normally,`
` and accordingly, I lay low at the family councils.`
` But I visit her every now and then, and we have tea together."`
`"I can't believe it...!"`
`"This is just between you and me, okay?`
` She removed her fingernails in atonement a long time ago herself.`
` Look carefully at her hand the next time you see her."`
`"Whaaat...?!`
` What did she do?"`
`"Beats me!`
` I don't have a clueâ˜†!"`
`"Hey, you do so have one! It's all over your face!`
` Tell meee!"`
