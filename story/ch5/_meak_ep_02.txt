`I was acting at first.`
`It was just an act to avoid being interrogated by the police.`
`As it turns out, though, fake insanity can become real.`
`You see, I couldn't bear it any longer.`
`I continued to be haunted by the presence Rena Ryuugu had talked about. It was so close that it could almost touch my back.`
`It wasn't Satoshi-kun, and it wasn't a hallucination.`
` It had become Shion's ghost.`
`Shion didn't go to Heaven after all.`
`She was always by my side instead.`
`Shion didn't like the fact that I was still alive when she wasn't.`
` So, she had decided to haunt me until she witnessed my death.`
` Every night, she whispered to me, telling me to die.`
`...I get it...`
` ...I get it!`
` ...Hah, hah, hah...`
`I shouted at the Shion in my back.`
`Through my mouth, she shouted back at me.`
`It must look odd to other people. They'd think I was arguing with myself.`
`It's not fair. Why are you still living, Sis?`
`Die, die, die already!`
`You said you'd die right after you killed me.`
`I'm waiting. I'm waiting...`
`It's so dark and cold in this well.`
` It's cold...`
` It hurts...`
` It hurts...`
` ...It hurts...`
`Ah, I get it, I get it!!!`
`Shut up!!`
`What exactly do you think, Sis? You won't die in the way you want to.`
`You're just running away. You're trying to survive, even after you did all those horrible things.`
`You'll never be forgiven. You're cursed.`
`You're cursed! You're destined to die!!!`
`"Shut up, Shion!!`
` You're just a ghost... so shut up.`
` Shut uuuuuuuup!!!"`
`"Sis.... Siiissss!!"`
`"You lousy shit!`
`Fuck off!!!"`
`"It's not fair, it's not fair! You and I should always be together, even after death...!!!`
` So, Mion, I've come to take you with me... Miooonn!!!!"`
`Bang, bang, bang, bang!!!!`
`Shion banged on the door.`
`Bam, bam, bam, bam!!!`
`That noise is too loud!!`
` It's cracking my ears and my head open!!`
` Shion's trying to break in! Ahh, shit! All right, Shion, I get it!`
` The perfect way for me to die is to be cursed to death by you, isn't it?! `
`But I won't be going so easily...`
` Hah, haaah...!!`
` I won't simply disappear. It wouldn't be fair if your beloved was left alive, after all!!`
` Ahahaha, hahahaa, heeheeheekyee!!!`
`I went out onto the balcony to avoid Shion, who was on the other side of the door.`
`If I jump over the railing to the neighboring apartment, I could reach the fire escape.`
`Heeheehyaakyakyaa!!`
` Eat shit, Shion!!!`
`I leaned over the railing and jumped to the balcony next door.`
`Then I rushed down the stairs, noiseless as a cat.`
`Shion was too stupid to realize that I escaped! Heekeekyaheeheegeehee!!`
`It wouldn't take too long to get to Keiichi's house on a motorcycle.`
`Shion must believe that I'm still in that room. She's so stupid!`
` Gheeheeheeheeheehee!!`
`Soon enough, I could see the Maebara mansion.`
`I'd never seen it before, but I'd heard a great deal about it from Shion. Kee hee hee hee!!!`
`She told me that Keiichi's room is on the second floor!!!`
`I should wake him up. Throw a stone! Gwa ha ha ha ha!!!`
`I threw a couple of stones at the window, and shortly thereafter the light turned on and the window opened.`
`I saw Keiichi there.`
`The moment I saw him...`
` my madness cooled off for a while.`
`Even from here, I could tell that Keiichi was running down the stairs.`
`He showed up quickly...`
` with a doll in his hand.`
`...I felt depressed to see it.`
`It was the doll he failed to give to Shion.`
`...It isn't fair after all, Shion.`
`I'm so jealous, Kei-chan...`
` I want to receive a doll from Satoshi-kun, too...!!!`
`"...Hah...`
` Hah...`
` ...Mion!"`
`"Ahahahaha, it's been a while~`
` ...How are you?`
` Been doing all right?"`
`Despite the burning insanity within me, I spoke to him calmly.`
`...Ah, it's true.`
`My body is controlled by the demon now...`
` Otherwise, I wouldn't be here this late...`
` Kee heehee...!!`
`"...Are you...`
` all right... hanging around this place...?!"`
`"......I really shouldn't be.`
` ...Ehehehe."`
`"Anyway... what's wrong?`
` What do you need at this hour?"`
`"...I wanted to talk to you one last time."`
`I feel horribly sleepy.`
`Maybe it's more like fainting due to loss of blood.`
`Ghee heehee, that sensation is proof that the insanity is swallowing me...`
`"......Well, I...`
` ehehehe...`
` I can't...`
` stay for any longer..."`
`"A-Are you all right...?`
` Are you not feeling well...?"`
`"...I tried... s-s... so hard until now...`
` Ahahaha...`
` but I can tell.`
` ...I'm done... This is my limit...`
` They're...`
`......`
` about to come up behind me to take me away...`
` Ahahaha......"`
`I won't get to decide how I die.`
`Shion won't allow me to.`
`No wonder. I dropped her down the well.`
`It wasn't only her. None of the people I killed chose to die how they did.`
`Considering that... debating how I'll die must seem a luxurious concern to the dead!`
`"Ah... hahaha...`
` haha... ha...`
` hah......`
` hah......`
` hah...!`
` Feegheeghagya...`
` hah...`
` ghaa..."`
`"Are you okay...?!`
` Don't force yourself...`
`Oh... that's right.`
` ...I had somethingâ€”"`
`...I'll kill him, kill him, kill him...`
` I'll avenge Satoshi-kun's death, I'll avenge his death!`
` ...This guy is Shion's beloved. I hate her! I'll kill him and teach her a lesson!`
` Eat this, Shi......`
` ............ghh!`
` ............!!`
`While gravity's pull spun around me,`
` I realized that I had stabbed him with a knife.`
`"Hee......`
` hee hee hee...`
` hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee`
`...!`
` I made it...`
` I made it in time...!`
` ...Hu hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!!"`
`Gheh gheh gheh gheh gheh!!`
` I made it, I made it, I made it before Shion killed me! I got back at her! Gheh gheh gheh gheh!!`
` Take that, Shion, gheh gheh gheh gheh gheh gheh!!`
`Keiichi rolled on the ground, clutching his stomach.`
`"Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!`
` I've done it! I've done it all!`
` That's everyone... I wanted to kill...!!!`
` Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!"`
`Yeah! I did it!! Hyahyagyagya, I did it!!!`
` Gheh gheh, I avenged your death, Satoshi-kun, gheh gheh!!!`
` Don't you love me for it?! Will you stroke my head?!`
` Gheh gheh gheh gyeeehhh!!!`
`Yes.`
` This was all a bad dream.`
`After all, I was just in my room like always, suffering from nightmares of Shion.`
`But...`
`......`
` where was I now?`
`I had been standing on my apartment's fire escape, alone.`
`...I could still recall that dream.`
`Yes, I had stepped out onto the veranda.`
`...My front door was still locked, so... I had to climb through the veranda again.`
`Hah...`
` ...hmm...`
`...`
` ...Whoa!`
`My foot had slipped, and then I felt a floating sensation.`
`After that, a sharp, indescribable pain ran through my head.`
`That incredible pain finally cleared the fog away from my nightmare...`
`I just slipped from the fire escape as I tried to return to my balcony...`
` ...and fell onto the roof jutting out from the elevator hall two or three floors down.`
`My room is on the eighth floor.`
`I wasn't expecting to be caught up here.`
`When I fell, my head landed right on the concrete corner, and I could feel both enormous pain and the warm blood dripping out.`
`...............I felt strangely calm.`
`I couldn't sense the demon. Shion's ghost, or my grudge.`
`...I felt just like a baby...`
` The nothingness brought me peace.`
`All my memories from when I was born and named Mion, up until today, came to my mind.`
`I recalled memories of the time I'd spent with Satoshi-kun. Tears rolled down my cheeks.`
`Where did I go wrong...?`
`When in my life did I make the wrong choice?`
`Ah, I do know just where and when that was... because Satoshi-kun reminded me...`
`"I'll leave`
`......`
` Satoko to you."`
`Sure.`
`I believe you'll return.`
` ......I'll be waiting for you.`
`I'll take care of Satoko.`
`I'll wait for you with her. We'll be good girls.`
`You left your precious sister to me, and nobody else.`
`I guess... I didn't get the significance of what you said...`
`But I'll be fine this time.`
`I love you...`
` Satoshi-kun.`
`Satoko.........`
` I'm sorry.`
`I'm sorry... everybody.`
`Shion... I'm really sorry.`
`......Could I repay everything with my death?`
`No way, right? That's not how it should be done.`
`I wanted Satoshi-kun to stroke my head one more time.`
`I wanted to hear him mumble one more time.`
`I knew it was too much to ask.`
`...And so, I had no other regrets.`
`That brought an end to my apologies.`
`I rolled over, sending myself falling to the ground...`
`...Head first.`
`I hoped my head would crack open.`
`To take me to the Hell I deserved.`
`I was just a demon.`
`I belonged in Hell.`
`Why was I born?`
` Why did this world give birth to me?`
`I shouldn't have been born.`
`I wouldn't have had to suffer if I hadn't been.`
`What was the meaning of my meaningless life?`
`If I wasn't born, nobody would have had to suffer.`
`Thank you for treating me kindly`
` even though I was like this.`
`Thank you for teaching me love`
` even though I was like this.`
`Even though I was like this......`
` even though`
`...`
`I'm really sorry, everybody.`
`I really am.`
`I'm sorry.`
`If Satoshi-kun could give me another chance...`
`...I wouldn't make the same mistake again.`
`...Never again.`
`Ah...`
` here comes the ground.`
`Bye.`
`I love you.`
`...Mmph.`
`Eh?`
