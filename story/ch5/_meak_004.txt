`It's a very quiet afternoon, as always.`
`Since I can't go outside as myself, I have to match schedules with Mion when I go shopping.`
`(I've gotten used to it by now, so it's no longer a hassle.)`
`Because of this, I naturally have to buy things in bulk.`
`Today, I shuttled between shops and my home.`
`"Ehh... I got this, I got that...`
` Oh, wait!`
` Isn't it a 100-yen sale day today?`
` I forgot this."`
`Being in a good mood, I spun around with my arms spread out.`
` I felt like a little whirlwind.`
`My arm hit a motorcycle parked on the sidewalk. It obviously wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`"...Ow!!`
` What the...?`
` Who parked this motorcycle here?"`
`I gave it a kick with no hesitation.`
`There were three motorcycles lined up there in a row.`
`They all fell like dominoes.`
`It was a beautiful sight. This is fun, I thought.`
`Being in such a good mood made me leave my guard down.`
`I didn't realize that the owners of the motorcycles were right nearby. They looked pretty scary.`
`They grabbed me by the neck and dragged me into a dark alley.`
`Then they called me all kinds of names...`
`Everything was happening too quickly for me to grasp what was going on...`
`"Dafuq're ye, bitch?!!`
` Whatcha think yer doin'?! Huhh?!"`
`"Fookin' bash yer head in, bitch!!"`
`"Grrraaaah!!`
` Gonna pay fer whatcha did!"`
`...Whoa.`
` They can't really talk properly.`
`I didn't have a clue what they were saying.`
`I had to translate their alien tongue into normal human words in order to understand.`
`'We are very upset because you knocked down our motorcycles.'`
`'You should immediately pay for the repair and compensation.'`
` ...Yeah, that was probably it.`
`'That's our offer. What do you say?'`
`'We'd be happy to listen to your opinion...'`
` Something like that?`
`"HuuUUh!!`
` Whatendaummm?!!"`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` I don't think I can continue interpreting."`
`"Ahh?!`
` Whacha sayin'?!!!"`
`I know what they're trying to say.`
`But somebody has to warn them`
` about the way they park their motorcycles.`
`It wouldn't be fair to those who obey the rules if there were no punishment for those who disobey them.`
` This is an accident, but it must also be God's will.`
`But, God...`
` you can use me to punish these guys, but how will you compensate me later...?`
`I heaved a huge sigh.`
`...Of course,`
` I wasn't afraid in this situation at all.`
`Because... it wasn't a dangerous one for me.`
`These three guys were yelling at the top of their lungs at a girl. They didn't look good doing it, and they had too many disadvantages.`
`First, there was the differences in gender and in the number of people.`
`Even if I did something wrong, as men shouting at a woman, it didn't make them look like they were in the right.`
`Added to that, there were three of them; it already looked like it was going to get violent.`
`Second, the location. Taking a girl into a dark, narrow alleyway is already a bad idea, and top of that they're asking for money, not just an apology.`
`Thanks to these facts, the public will be on my side...`
` so this was a fight they couldn't possibly win.`
`The only way for them to win would be to take my money before somebody finds out.`
`...Considering that, taking me to this narrow, secluded alleyway might've been a smart move, since fewer people will find out about this situation.`
`"Huuuh!!`
` Ye list'nin or not?!"`
`I knew how slim their chances of winning were.`
`From the very beginning, they had picked the wrong girl.`
`I'm 'Mion Sonozaki' now.`
`It'd be foolish to mug her in Okinomiya.`
`Soon enough, the people of Hinamizawa would notice me and gather 'round.`
`They don't spare mercy for their enemies, no matter what.`
`The punks didn't know this area well.`
`If they did, they'd have known how silly it was to rob 'Mion.'`
`Plus, the alleyway isn't always as empty as they assumed.`
`This side street is a shortcut which local people frequently use on their way home.`
`In the late afternoon, many people will be passing through here.`
`That time had almost arrived.`
`If I held off a little longer, the street would soon be filled with people.`
` Then the punks would have to go away.`
`I didn't have to do anything.`
`I just had to wait in order to win.`
`This was a simple fight like that.`
`While they could hurl abusive language at me, or lift me up by my collar, they weren't actually going to resort to violence.`
`Cheers to the educational system for ingraining the "ladies first" mindset!`
`...But, as a wicked person, I wanted to toy with them a bit, even though I could win this by waiting.`
`I wanted to paint them as even more villainous, and drive them into a corner that would be even harder to talk their way out of.`
` ...That demonic desire was rearing its horns.`
`To put it plainly, I'd only need to act as the poor, helpless victim a little further.`
`Like the pathetic, pitiful, tragic heroine everyone wants to sympathize with.`
`...In a case like this, I shouldn't start crying immediately, because they'd get nervous and draw back.`
`If it were a truly threatening situation, that would work, but I needed something different here.`
`I'd pretend to be strong at first. In fact, I thought, why don't I challenge them?`
`...And eventually, I'd start trembling, my voice would fade, and I'd get tears in my eyes...`
`......It'd be even better if I played the role of a strong girl who's slowly giving into fear.`
`......Mion and I are probably the only ones who are capable of pulling that kind of stuff off...`
` Well, I'm probably better than her.`
`"...Wh-Why don't you let me go now?!`
` I... already apologized..."`
`I talked back with a little hesitation...`
`Am I getting tears yet...?`
` Yes!`
`By the way, I've heard men can't shed tears on command...`
` I feel sorry for them.`
`The three punks faltered a bit due to my sudden change in attitude, but they soon started yelling at me again.`
`I had to keep it going.`
`That way they'd blatantly look like they're picking on a helpless girl...`
`"...Please...`
` ...forgive me...`
` hic...`
` ...hic...`
` ooh...!"`
`"Wh-Whacha doin?!`
` Wh-What's wid dis girl, huuh?!"`
`"...I... don't... hic... huff... ooohh..."`
`"...Mebbe... ye shoulda 'pologized like dat from da start..."`
`It looked like they were laying off a bit...`
` Did I overdo it a little?`
`It'd be boring if they let me go now...`
`...At that moment--`
`"Cu... Cut it out...!`
` Don't you see her crying?! Stop it...!!"`
`A boy around my age appeared.`
`He was skinny.`
`He looked weak.`
`He looked younger than he probably was.`
`He also looked smart. He bravely glared at the punks.`
`"What da hell...?!`
` Who dafuq are ye?!!"`
`"Back dafuq off, rraaaghhhh!!!"`
`The punks turned away from me to face the boy instead.`
`The boy looked a bit agitated when the punks started yelling at him.`
`They sure were ruthless.`
`...But the boy must have known that from the beginning.`
`He must have known that he was going into a dangerous situation,`
` yet he didn't hesitate.`
`"Fookin' say sumtin'!!`
` Why don'tcha answer us?!!"`
`"....................."`
`He must have wanted to shout back at them.`
`...But he'd probably never used that kind of language in his life.`
`So he couldn't have expressed his feelings out loud.`
`He might have not even known what to say.`
`So he just kept on glaring at them.`
`To let them know that he wasn't going anywhere.`
`The three punks, though, might have thought he was just lost for words in his fear.`
`But I knew different.`
`...The boy was overpowering them with nothing but his will.`
`...The punks were losing.`
`So, they resorted to violence.`
`They grabbed him and knocked him down. They hit, kicked, and tossed him around.`
`...It looked painful, but I knew.`
`It was his victory.`
`In the end, local passersby stopped the punks.`
`They made no further fuss and just went away.`
`...The boy stood up. He was covered in dust.`
`He smiled when our eyes met,`
` and asked me if I was all right.`
`...He didn't look particularly okay himself, though.`
`"...How could you step into a fight you obviously couldn't win?`
` Pick your opponents better next time."`
`"...I hesitated at first.`
` Ahahahaha..."`
`He laughed...`
` Saying that he was watching`
` from the beginning.`
`...That meant`
` he had the option to walk away.`
`...But instead, he worked up the courage, and stepped in.`
`"That was reckless,`
` not brave."`
`"...Mmph.`
` You're being a little harsh, Mion...`
` You should at least say 'thank you.'`
` I saw you crying."`
`"...N-No, I wasn't crying!`
` That was just an act...!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` Okay, okay.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"H-Hey!`
` You don't believe me, do you?!`
` Do you really think I'd cry?"`
`"No.`
` Nobody'd believe Mion Sonozaki would cry when punks bullied her. Ah ha ha ha."`
`"Wh-Why are you laughing?!`
` You really don't believe that was an act?!`
` I'd never cry!!"`
`"Ha ha ha ha. I believe you, I do."`
`I realized one thing.`
`...He must be one of Sis's friends.`
`He didn't seem to realize I'm her twin.`
` He thought I was Mion with a different hairstyle.`
`...Mion and I had to live separately since before we went to elementary school.`
`Mion was in Hinamizawa,`
` and I was in Okinomiya.`
`I lived in a totally different environment from her.`
`So, it's not strange that people don't know me.`
` Actually, only very few people know I exist.`
`I almost told him that I'm not Mion, but I managed to stop myself.`
`......Shion shouldn't be here.`
`He's from Hinamizawa.`
` It wouldn't be good if he thought he saw a Mion lookalike in Okinomiya...`
`So, I had to act like Mion.`
`...Dealing with him could be more difficult than handling those punks...`
`"...Well,`
` I was just relieved because you seem to have a girly side after all."`
`"You sound hostile. What exactly do you mean by that?"`
`"I thought you'd kick those guys' butts with some crazy martial arts...`
` So I was really surprised when you just started crying."`
`"Hey!`
` Like I said, I was acting!`
` Weren't you listening at all`
`....................."`
`...He gently put his hand on top of my head, and stroked it as if stroking a kitten.`
`...I could remember somebody doing that to me when I was little, but...`
` it had been quite a while since somebody stroked my head.`
`I didn't know what to do...`
` Why did it make me so embarrassed...?`
`......My face reddened all at once. I couldn't say anything...`
`"He...Hey...`
` Are you making fun of me...?"`
`I stuttered in embarrassment.`
`He looked calm, as if he was used to doing this.`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` Whatever.`
` Aren't you glad, though?"`
`"......Glad? ...What do you mean?"`
`"Well, you didn't get hurt."`
`He smiled while he kept stroking my head...... His smile looked divine.`
`He wasn't going to stay for long.`
`...He'd already saved me from those guys, after all.`
`"...Well, I need to be going.`
` So I should head off now."`
`"Uh... okay."`
`I wanted to go through all the steps of meeting someone for the first time, but he didn't.`
`As far as he was concerned, he just saved a friend from danger, and wanted to leave quickly to avoid seeming pretentious.`
`He and Mion must be friends who knew each other well.`
`...So I couldn't bring myself to ask, "What's your name?"`
`'Mion's friend' smiled once again. His smile looked as refreshing as a clear blue sky.`
` This time, he smiled a bit mischievously.`
`"Ahaha, don't worry.`
` I won't tell anybody you were crying.`
` ...Ahaha, well, nobody would believe it if I told them, anyway.`
` Nobody would ever believe that our invincible class president cried.`
` Ahahahaha."`
`He patted the dust off his butt once again.`
`He walked back to the sunny main road, away from the dark alley.`
`Then he turned around.`
`"See you.`
` In school tomorrow, I mean."`
`"......Yeah...`
` See you in school."`
`He disappeared into the brightly lit street.`
`I continued to sit in the gloomy alleyway.`
`I could no longer see him.`
`I was just staring absentmindedly at the bright light.`
`That was the first time I met Satoshi-kun...`
`"That must be Satoshi.`
` He looks like what you described, and he has a habit of stroking people's heads."`
`"...Uh-huh...`
` His name is Satoshi-kun, eh...?"`
`The boy from earlier is called Satoshi Houjou-kun.`
` Mion said that he's always daydreaming.`
`...So she didn't believe that he saved me at first.`
`"His little sister`
` is always kicking his butt. Ahahaha."`
`"Uh-huh,`
` he has a little sister?"`
`"Yeah,`
` her name is Satoko.`
` She's funny`
` and shrewd,`
` but is quick to cry when she's cornered.`
` She's fun to watch......`
` But things have been rough for her lately,`
` so she's feeling a bit down."`
`His sister came up naturally in the conversation.`
`...I tried to soak up every scrap of information about Satoshi-kun.`
`...Why?`
`Why am I trying to ask so much about him?`
`...As I asked myself that, the feeling I got when he stroked my head came back to me.`
`...I must have been blushing.`
`"Hello?`
` Shion?"`
`"Eh? Ahahahaha, sorry!`
` I'm here, I'm listening!"`
`"To start, I hear Satoko's on bad terms with her aunt...`
` Satoshi's mature, so he knows how to conduct himself, but... when bad things happen, Satoko really lets herself go."`
`What Sis told me was very interesting.`
`....She told me that the parents of Satoshi-kun and his little sister are dead.`
`Satoshi-kun and Satoko are now living with their uncle and aunt.`
`They don't seem like very respectable people.`
`They're always fighting, and the uncle is cheating on the aunt.`
`He mostly lives with his mistress.`
`...Satoshi-kun and Satoko entered into that unwelcome environment.`
`What surprises me the most... is the fact that Satoshi-kun's parents were the Houjou couple who were the leaders of the pro-dam activists.`
`That fact must've added something to the situation.`
`...I don't know what kind of stance the uncle and aunt took during the dam conflict, but they must've taken some indirect blows.`
`Satoshi-kun's parents died after bothering them so much, and even left them their children...  The uncle and aunt obviously can't love those kids.`
`Things have gotten worse this past year, too.`
`Women can be really nasty bullies.`
`Sometimes it doesn't matter who they're bullying, even if it's a kid.`
`On top of that, women tend to care less about propriety than men...`
`...As a result, Satoko seems exhausted with it all.`
`I can imagine Satoshi-kun bravely protecting his little sister.`
`Just like when he saved me.`
`"So... He must be exhausted too, right?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`"He must be covering for Satoko all the time.`
` So wouldn't you normally assume that he's also feeling worn out?"`
`"...Hmm`
`... well...`
` I don't know..."`
`Had I said something wrong?`
`Mion sounded a bit taken aback.`
`So that meant...`
`Mion can't tell how he's feeling...`
`Because he's always wearing that blank look.`
` So she never considered it...`
`How can she be that insensitive even though she's around him all the time?`
`I was amazed to realize that.`
`"Well,`
` anyway,`
` what does he usually do?`
` He looked smart, so does he read a lot of books?"`
`"Aha, ahahaha!`
` Yeah... you're right. He likes to read.`
` He's now reading... what's it called...?"`
`I continued asking about him.`
`About what he likes, dislikes, and what he thinks about.`
`I asked Sis all these questions because I wanted to know more about him.`
`It was the first time I'd ever been that interested in somebody.`
`I didn't want to admit that I had feelings like that.`
`Did I fall in love just because of a stroke on the head? ...Am I stupid, or what?`
`When I remember the feeling of his hand on my head, my heart feels tingly.`
`I tried doing it myself, but it didn't feel the same.`
`......Ahahahaha. I'm stupid.`
` What am I doing, stroking my own head...?`
`"Ahahahahahaha...`
` Sis, I'm done for...`
` I became stupid..."`
`"What?`
` Why are you laughing`
` in that weird voice?"`
`"Ahahahahaha, you wouldn't understand this feeling, Sis.`
` Ahahahahahaha..."`
`When would I see him again?`
`I felt as if my suffocating life had finally grown brighter.`
