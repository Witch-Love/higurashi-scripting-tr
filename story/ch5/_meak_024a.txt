`"............Give it a fucking rest..."`
`Keiichi's growl resounded from the pits of his stomach.`
`...What a delightful sound. It was like he wanted to rip me apart.`
`"Awake at last, are we?`
` I lied to you before, you know.`
` ...About having wanted to give Shion the most miserable death of all, but locking her up because I hadn't thought of a good way yet.`
` That was a lie."`
`I smiled menacingly as I laid out the huge nails and hammer specially made for the nail table.`
`"I'll kill her, but only after her soul drowns in the screams of the many people who died because of her.`
` ...Wouldn't that be poetic?`
` Heh heh heh heh!!"`
`"............Who...`
` are you?"`
`"Hah?`
` I'm Mion.`
` Mion Sonozaki.`
` Did the fear drive you out of your mind?`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"...No, you're not.`
` There's... no way you can be Mion Sonozaki...!"`
`My hand stopped dead in its tracks.`
`...Kei-chan?`
`Shit.`
` I'd decided it would be too late once we reached Shion's cell.`
`So the name-guessing game is already over.`
`...Oh well, whatever.`
` Bring it on.`
` I'll listen to you.`
` This is your last chance.`
`"...Oh yeah?`
` Then if I'm not Mion, who am I?"`
`Come on, Kei-chan.`
` ...Guess who I am.`
` Try and save Mion, the girl who fell in love with you.`
`And then, I heard it. I most definitely heard it.`
`Keiichi's mouth trembled as he spoke the words, yet his eyes shone with a strong conviction.`
`And he spoke the truth.`
`".........You're Shion, aren't you?"`
`"........"`
`........Wow...`
`You're right. You actually won... You're amazing Kei-chan...`
`Heh heh..... heheheheheh.....!`
`A strange feeling fills my chest as I shiver.`
`I had convinced myself there was no way he could guess.`
`But he did... and I couldn't help feeling a bit surprised.`
`This Keiichi had yet again pierced through my disguise.`
`"You aren't Mion.`
` ...Give me back the Mion whom I was with until just now!"`
`"............"`
`Who... are you?`
`"Huh...?"`
`...You aren't Mion, right?`
`"...huh?`
` Like I said, I'm Mion..."`
`No, that's not it. That wasn't what I meant.`
` You aren't Mion...`
`"Hehehehe...`
` Why do you think I'm not the older sister?"`
`I don't know... Just a feeling.`
`In my mind, memories of the time Keiichi recognized me at the toy store had been revived.`
`Yes.`
`Even back then, Keiichi could tell that I wasn't my sister Shion.`
`I had feigned composure and offered a comeback with a straight face, but on the inside I was shook.`
`We were both capable of becoming Mion or Shion... But because I was the real 'Mion', and was only Shion legally on paper, reversing the roles was even more easier for me.`
`Our tones of speech, quirks and even our auras... We had both mastered each others' habits so perfectly, even our own parents were unable to tell us apart.`
`In fact, wasn't that exceptionally sharp Rena not able to figure out I wasn't her best friend Mion after all, despite being so close?`
`So why?`
`Has this Keiichi actually seen through my disguise twice?`
`"Hehehehe...`
` Why do you think I'm not the older sister?"`
`My ears perked up, eager to hear the answer. Keiichi's reply was a soft murmur like an insect's whisper, as he gasped for breath in pain.`
`His voice was so quiet, it was nearly inaudible. But I could almost recognize the words on his lips.`
`Yes... "Just a feeling", he says......!`
`"Wow..."`
`...Heh, heheheh, hehehehehehehehehehe...!!`
`Yet again. It was "just a feeling".`
`Didn't he say the exact same thing to me, that time at the toy store?`
`Hahahahahahahahahaha. How nice, how nice! What a splendid answer!`
`You'd think why my sister of all people fell in love with him?!`
`Ahahahahahaha, ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`".............."`
`...............However.`
`No... rather, it was exactly because of this.`
`Along with my raving madness, the blood that was simmering in my veins until just now rapidly began to turn chill and coagulate. If I were to describe it, it felt like stagnant muddy water flowing through a gutter.`
`Even now, it was all so hilarious I could fall over laughing, but I didn't smile. On the contrary, my face was vacant and austere, like a Noh-mask of frigid ice.`
`And then.`
`The darkness seeped into the innermost depths of my mind, and I was already parting with my self-restraint as a human being.`
`"..............."`
`I reach out and touch Keiichi's hair, matted with sweat and caked with blood. Keiichi whips his head away at once in disgust, as if he were staving off a housefly — and glares at me defiantly.`
`"Don't touch me! `
` ...You damn demon...!!!`
` Give her back!!`
` Give Mion back!!!`
` Give me back my best friend Mion!!!"`
`Having lost liberty over his whole body, he continued to howl and cry as if he were spewing blood.`
`...I was supposed to have sold my soul to the devil and become a demon, but faced with such a bitter rejection, I felt the crumbled remnants of my emotions stir within me.`
`Munch, crunch, munch, crunch, munch, crunch......!!`
`My throat begins to itch. The crooks of my elbows, my wrists, and every other joint in my body begins to tingle and prickle... and I feel irrationally restless.`
`The more the restlessness and irritation piled up, the more this squalling, whimpering person beside me felt bothersome, revolting... so awful I could slaughter him right away.`
`To be frank... until just now, I had no intention of killing Keiichi.`
`I was truly ready to spare at least his life, if he guessed the right answer.`
`That was the rule I had decided upon.`
`Okay... I'll admit it. Just like Shion, I had also... fallen in love with Keiichi.`
`He was incredibly silly and good-natured—unbelievably warm-hearted and gentle... talking to him made me feel contented.`
`Besides, I even sympathized with him.`
`Unlike the lot I'd dealt with so far - Keiichi was indeed just a victim - caught up in my selfish revenge drama. Now that my revenge against the Sonozaki family was almost complete, I didn't mind saving him.`
`...That may sound too convenient, but perhaps the human side of 'me' that was fond of Keiichi wanted to save him - in order to seek his forgiveness for my actions.`
`But... I've changed my mind.`
`Having witnessed Keiichi guess the right answer before my very eyes, my heart was suffused with a stinging, gaping, overpowering darkness, as if it were freezing over.`
`Why.`
`Why was Shion alone able to meet such a wonderful person?`
`Satoshi-kun could only make a vague distinction between me and Shion.`
`Satoshi-kun... abandoned me and ran away.`
`However, this Keiichi trusts Shion. He is defending Shion whom he values as his best friend, by seeing through my lies.`
`And as a result... he gave up on me.`
`Destestable. Maddening. Despicable. Enviable...... So much so that I want to kill them.`
`That's right. The moment he defended Shion, he became one of them. He's equally guilty. You lowlife scum, I despise you, I despise you, I despise you, I despise you, I despise you, you fucking piece of shit...!!!`
`"Please stoooooop!!!`
` Don't kill him!!!`
` Kei-chan, get out of hereeeeeee!!!"`
`Munch, crunch, munch, crunch, munch, crunch......!!`
`...Ah, what a nuisance.`
`Shion's screams coming from the corner of the chamber were enjoyable before; but now they felt unbearably noisy and pissed me off.`
`How about I just get rid of Shion first?`
`I wanted to kill her after she had the most exquisite taste of anguish and terror, but now I could barely suppress the indiscriminate urge to slaughter welling up within me.`
`Keiichi was relentlessly yelling his protests towards me.`
`His throat closed up eventually and he gasped for breath, hoarsely continuing to demand Mion's return.`
`"...Kei-chan.`
` This may not be... something pleasant to take to the grave with you.`
` ...But you really seem to want to know, so I'll tell you just one thing.`
`The demon had already been dwelling inside me for a long time.`
` It had been gnawing at my heart, trying to spur me to violence, but...`
` I suppressed it with reasoning.`
`The demon calmed down... and I convinced myself that it had disappeared.`
` As it turns out, I was wrong.`
` The demon never left me... it had just been asleep inside me."`
`Yes.`
`When I learned about Satoshi-kun's disappearance, my ailing heart had crammed itself with rage to compensate for the despair.`
`But that was the limit of my insanity. I would never have snapped.`
`Time had healed me... and my memories of Satoshi-kun were neatly wrapped up and pushed into the back of my mind.`
`"That demon... had awoken again thanks to a certain, small opportunity.`
` What do you think... that opportunity was...?"`
`It really was the smallest of the smallest things.`
`"........."`
`"This might be a strange thing to hear from a demon, but...`
` you're the reason everything got so messed up."`
`A tear rolled down my cheek.`
`That's right.`
`Back then... if you hadn't given that doll to Mion, none of this would have happened...`
`"...You probably can't understand.`
` I don't expect you to.`
`...But, you see, after that, everything began to topple over one by one, like clattering dominoes... and it all got out of hand.`
`It's normal you didn't realize because it was so small, but as the person to knock over the very first one... you were the cause of this tragedy."`
`Back then, if Keiichi hadn't shown any affection, Shion wouldn't have been overjoyed.`
`She wouldn't have been overjoyed, and cheerfully boasted about him to me.`
`As I was listening to her, I was reminded of Satoshi-kun. `
`I became jealous of her for having someone she loved so close to her.`
`It was a very small jealousy. `
`But it had awoken the demon who was sleeping deep inside of me.`
`After that, I just let the demon take over.`
`The demon fed upon the copious amount of sadness I held for Satoshi-kun, and in return it committed heinous acts that Satoshi-kun himself would never be happy with, all in the name of avenging him.`
`And now, the horrific events that had followed were inviting me to the realm of demons that had no return.`
`"That... that can't... be, can it...?"`
`"...I'm not surprised you weren't aware.`
` Even so you are without doubt the cause of this, Kei-chan."`
`Back then, if you hadn't chosen to give the doll to Mion... we could've arrived at a different future.`
`.........No, that wasn't right.`
`Wouldn't pinpointing Keiichi's small action as the beginning, be the height of transferring blame?`
`...I was implying such a silly thing had awoken the demon inside me.`
`Even without Keiichi's act, it would've have awoken anyway.`
`...At the end of the day, it was all my fault. `
`I didn't fight the demon. I allowed it to reside in my soul. And I readily offered it my heart.`
`"......gh...... ugh...!!"`
`Keiichi didn't hide his tears. They were pouring down his cheeks.`
`...Maybe he was crying in my place, as I was not free to do so, having chosen to become a tearless demon. `
`That is why I must go on, as the demon. `
`There was no room for human emotions or hesitation anymore.`
`And then......`
`Munch, crunch, munch, crunch, munch, crunch...... snap......!!`
`".........n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.....!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`Shion's wails rasping like silk tearing apart, along with my screams of ecstasy.`
`The last thing I heard... were those everlasting reverberations.`
