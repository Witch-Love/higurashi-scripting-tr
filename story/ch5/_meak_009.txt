`I was looking up at the ceiling with my arms and legs spread out.`
`It's not that I wasn't getting hungry.`
`...I didn't live with my parents. I didn't live in the school dorm.`
`That meant I had to cook something myself when I wanted to eat.`
`I knew that... but I still didn't feel like getting up.`
`It had been several days since I began this empty life.`
`It must be tomorrow...`
` The Watanagashi festival, I mean.`
`I heard the doorbell ringing.`
`I ignored it at first, but it rung persistently.`
`I started hearing knocking, alongside Kasai's rude voice.`
`"Shion-san.`
` Please open up.`
` I bought some food for you."`
`...I didn't ask him to.`
`He must've known that I hadn't eaten enough and that I'd been feeling down lately.`
`"......You haven't eaten, have you?"`
`"No......`
` I'm not hungry."`
`But when Kasai put the food on the table, my stomach reacted in a very primitive way by making some noise.`
`"Your stomach is growling...`
` I believe you need to eat."`
`I was hungry, but had no appetite.`
`I mean, I did have an appetite, but didn't have the energy to eat.`
`Yet I'd feel bad wasting the food Kasai had brought.`
`I picked up my chopsticks just to humor him.`
`"I thought you were marked by the hag.`
` Is it okay for you to be here?"`
`"Oryou-san is busy with the festival preparation meetings. She doesn't seem to have time to deal with you right now......`
` Didn't you like croquettes?"`
`"Hmm... they're good.`
` ...Thanks."`
`While I nibbled on the food, Kasai read through the magazines I bought.`
`"...Have you...`
` uhh..."`
`I'd never talked to Kasai about something like this before.`
`...Since I've always believed myself superior to him psychologically, I hesitated to show my weaknesses to him.`
`"That kind of hardship is healthy for your age."`
`"...!`
` Hey, do you know`
` about that...?!"`
`"Mion-san told me a little about it.`
` She said she wanted me to assist you."`
`"...She did, did she?`
` Tssk."`
`"She looked worried.`
` Your sister is looking out for you."`
`Without responding, I threw the last croquette in my mouth.`
`"I thought you might want to know how Satoshi Houjou-kun is doing.`
` I've gathered some information. Would you like me to report?"`
`"That's not necessary...`
` but since you went through all the trouble, I think I'd better listen."`
`Kasai chuckled, but stopped quickly as if thinking it rude.`
`"It seems that Teppei Houjou fled the premises.`
` He seems to be staying at his mistress's place in Okinomiya."`
`"Teppei?`
` Who's that?`
` ......Oh, Satoshi-kun's uncle, huh?"`
`"Their aunt - Tamae Houjou, Satoshi, and Satoko are the only ones living in the house now.`
` Ever since Tamae learned that Teppei had fled to his mistress, she's been in a foul mood."`
`"So that must mean...`
` that the aunt is being even nastier to Satoko, and Satoshi-kun is taking even more indirect blows." `
`"I don't know about Satoshi-kun, but I heard that Satoko-san looks very miserable. The neighbors are spreading rumors about her."`
`If Satoko looks miserable,`
` that means Satoshi-kun must be going through equally miserable torture.`
`"Can't you do something about that aunt?`
` Doesn't anybody talk about punishing her?"`
`She's also one of the remaining Houjous, after all.`
` The uncle is gone, so why not the aunt?`
`"...The main Sonozaki family ruled against further harassment toward the Houjou family after the death of the couple. `
`They say the police still might be staking out their house, due to suspicions about the couple's death."`
`"Their deaths have been filed under Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` So the Sonozaki family thinks no further divine intervention is necessary?"`
`Kasai put on a faint smile.`
`Come to think of it...`
`...It is hard not to suspect the involvement of the Sonozaki family in all the incidents said to be Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`Somebody strives to get rid of the hag's concerns`
` on the day of the Watanagashi festival.`
`Furthermore,`
` the Watanagashi festival is going to be held tomorrow.`
`......Will the curse strike again this year?`
`If so... who will be the victim?`
`Now that I think about it... there were cases of multiple victims in the past.`
`The first and third year, it was just one, but the second year, the victims were a couple.`
`So it wouldn't be too strange if two people fell victim this year.`
`It seems like a good time.`
`It'd be best for Satoko and her aunt to be the victims.`
`Satoshi-kun will be freed from every source of his worries all at once!`
`"...Kasai,`
` do you know if this year's victim has been selected already?"`
`".................."`
`"Does the hag make the decision?`
` If so, Sis should know about it by now.`
` Kasai,`
` do you know anything?"`
`"Shion-san... I don't know anything about that matter."`
`"...Well, that makes sense.`
` That kind of secret won't make its way to you, because you're just a small fry."`
`"...That's true.`
` I've never received any information regarding that from my connections.`
` But as you know... the Sonozaki family has access to many underground organizations,`
` which I have no channels into."`
`...Maybe I could try asking Sis about it...`
` but she won't talk.`
`She's strict about keeping promises, unlike me.`
`If the hag told her to keep a secret, she'd take it to her grave.`
`"...Damn...`
` I hope Satoko and her aunt will go missing this year."`
`"....................."`
`"......Hey, Kasai, I just <i>thought</i> of that.`
` Aren't you going to do something about it?"`
`"Shion-san... you must be joking..."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm just kidding."`
`I took a glimpse at Kasai.`
`...It didn't look like he was actually going to do something to make my wish come true.`
`I wasn't able to go to the village as myself.`
`So, I definitely wasn't going to the festival. I didn't care about that.`
`Even so... I was interested in who was going to end up as the victim of the curse.`
`If I just kept lying on this couch, playing hooky, somebody would fall victim in several hours.`
`I had no clue why it had to happen every year.`
`But I was certain that the hag was behind it.`
`All the enemies from the dam conflict had been punished.`
`...Only the Houjou couple was left, since most of the other enemies had already gone.`
`The cicadas were crying loudly outside. It made me feel hot.`
`Why was it this hot and humid in June?`
`If Oyashiro-sama was actually punishing people...... I'd pray for one thing.`
`I'd pray that the evil aunt would be punished,`
` and I'd offer up Satoko`
` as a sacrifice.`
`Hah`
`...............`
` It's hot.`
`When I woke up, Kasai had already gone.`
`Looks like he cleaned the table and the surrounding room.`
`He put my dirty laundry into the hamper in front of the washing machine too.`
`...Being a girl of a sensitive age, I didn't want a man to clean my room.`
`Well, I'd rather thank him than badmouth him.`
`I looked at the clock. It was late afternoon.`
`...I had to go grocery shopping.`
`There was nothing left in the fridge,`
` and I'd be having just rice for dinner if I didn't go.`
`At that moment.`
` ......The phone rang.`
`It must be Kasai, I thought.`
`I did hope it was him.`
`...He could have brought more food,`
` so then I wouldn't have to go shopping......`
` While I was just being lazy...`
` I didn't feel like going out at all.`
`But...`
` It wasn't Kasai on the phone.`
`"...Sis...`
` where are you calling from?`
` The house?"`
`"Uh, no...`
` I'm calling from a pay phone,`
` so I'll make it quick...`
` Satoshi called me."`
`"...Satoshi-kun did?`
` He called you?"`
`"......It probably wasn't me he wanted.`
` He called you, I think...`
` It sounded like he wanted to apologize for what happened the other day...`
` so I thought you should take the call."`
`"....................."`
`"I told him that I'd call back because I was busy...`
` so, can you call this number...?"`
`".........Um, o-okay...!"`
`I was stunned for a second, but then recovered and wrote down the number on the back of a magazine.`
`"...Thanks.`
` I'll call right away."`
`"Good...`
` He's been extremely stressed these days...`
` I don't think he'll listen to me anymore, but`
` I think he'll listen to you."`
`She could have pretended to be me and handled his call.`
`......But she passed it over to me.`
`"Thanks,`
` Mion..."`
`"See you, Shion..."`
`Before she hung up, I put the handset down.`
` Then after a second, I dialed the number in a flash.`
`I heard the dial tone`
` ...three times,`
` four times......`
` and there he was.`
`"......Houjou residence."`
`He sounded like an adult.`
`His voice sounded a bit tired too, but it definitely was the voice I loved.`
`...I got scared.`
`...I was scared that he might become sulky again if I mentioned my name... I couldn't open my mouth for a while.`
`"Uh...`
` is that you,`
` Satoshi-kun...?"`
`"Oh... sorry that I called you so suddenly.`
` Are you okay now?"`
`That was the Satoshi-kun I knew.`
`...He didn't sound cold like the other day.`
`"...Yes...`
` I'm okay now."`
`"...Uh... good."`
`After that, he went silent.`
`...I felt the urge to start a conversation.`
`...It wasn't fair. He was the one who called in the first place...`
`Then,`
` he finally spoke.`
`"...I'm truly sorry`
` for what happened the other day."`
`"Uh...`
` hmm...`
` I'm...`
` sorry too...!"`
`"...You don't have to apologize...`
` because I was the one in the wrong."`
`If this were a face-to-face conversation, he would be stroking my head...`
` It was sad just talking to him over the phone.`
`"...I won't forgive those people who forced us into this situation...`
` you might be close to them,`
` but it was never you personally...`
` So I wanted to apologize."`
`"......No, please don't apologize...`
` I was selfish and didn't try to understand your situation very well......"`
`We apologized to each other a few times.`
`"...Satoshi-kun,`
` are you all right...?`
` You're working, and you're under a lot of stress......`
` Isn't that too much to handle?"`
`"...I quit my job`
` since I have enough money now."`
`"...You did...?`
` That's good. You don't have to push yourself anymore, then...`
` That's really good."`
`Satoshi-kun tried to say something, but he dropped it instead.`
`"Satoko...`
` has it far worse than me."`
`".....................`
`...Seems like it...`
` Is she all right?"`
`"...Does she look all right to you...?"`
`He suddenly sounded upset...`
` I'd messed up.`
`"S-S-Sorry!`
` I'm sorry...!`
` I'm sorry...!"`
`I was so stupid...!!`
`I had ruined this miraculous conversation with him...!!`
`Satoshi-kun didn't respond to my apology...`
` so I stopped apologizing.`
`"...She was tortured until she was literally torn up...`
` And everybody abandoned her...`
` Everybody did."`
`"I... I didn't..."`
`I tried to calm him down...`
` I hated what I just said because of how hollow it sounded.`
`I had no idea what to say next.`
` I felt guilty.`
`Satoshi-kun was desperate to protect Satoko from their evil aunt.`
`...But I'd wished that Satoko would die tomorrow because of the curse.`
`...I was trampling on his desperate hope.`
`"...Satoko can't take it anymore...`
` so...`
`..................`
`"`
`He cut himself off in the middle...`
`And went quiet for a moment.`
` He must have been choosing his words carefully...`
`Then, he finally spoke.`
`His words sounded hollow.`
`"...I mean...`
` I want her to have fun for one night."`
`"...Eh?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"The Watanagashi festival is tomorrow, isn't it?`
` I want you to take her there."`
`"Yeah, I can do that, but... why?"`
`"......She's exhausted,`
` so... I think she'd be happy if she could get away from our aunt for even just one night."`
`"...But... why...?"`
`"...Why...?"`
`It's not that I didn't understand why he wanted her taken to the festival.`
`...What I didn't understand is why he was asking me to do that.`
`Was there any reason he couldn't take her there himself?`
`I had a hunch that he might disappear... so I kept asking...`
`"...What do you mean, why...?"`
`"...Why don't you take her yourself...?"`
`"......Um......"`
`He fell silent.`
`Satoshi-kun isn't good at lying or keeping secrets.`
`...It was clear that he wanted to hide something.`
`"...I-I just have some stuff that I need to take care of with my work tomorrow...`
` so I can't go to the festival."`
`He was lying.`
`...But, he was also stubborn.`
`He wouldn't admit it if I accused him.`
`"...Mion,`
` can you... take her there tomorrow...?"`
`"....................."`
`I wouldn't want to look after Satoko`
` even at Satoshi-kun's request...`
` but I'm also glad that he's relying on me.`
`"I know it's ridiculous to ask for your help after that incident...`
` but you're the only person I can turn to now."`
`...I didn't know what to say.`
`I did know, though, that I wasn't going to turn down his request.`
`"...Okay...`
` but just for tomorrow.`
` All right?"`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` I hope you'll keep looking after her."`
`"What are you saying?`
` I won't do that.`
` Just for tomorrow."`
`He sounded as if he were going to disappear tomorrow.`
`...I didn't like the sound of that, so I intentionally sounded sulky.`
`We talked about trivial stuff`
` for just a little while.`
`When the conversation was almost over, Satoshi-kun asked something else.`
`"Hey... ...Mion.`
` ......I really hate asking this, since you might think I'm crazy for saying it, but..."`
`"...Hm?`
` What?"`
`"...You... ahahahahaha...`
` ...don't believe in it, right?"`
`"Believe in what?"`
`"...Um`
`...`
` ...in Oyashiro-sama's`
` curse."`
`"Uh... ahahahaha.`
` What are you talking about, Satoshi-kun?"`
`"Those who abandon the village and try to run away get cursed by Oyashiro-sama, right?"`
`That's the rule.`
`Every kid in the village knows that.`
`"...Ahaha,`
` that's the rule.`
` What's with that suddenly?`
` ...Are you planning to leave?"`
`Though I was kidding, I wanted him to deny it.`
`"...I'm not thinking about that...`
` anymore."`
`He admitted that he had thought of it.`
`...I guess Rena told me that much.`
`"...That's good.`
` So you're not leaving the village?"`
`"...No, but...`
` I haven't been forgiven yet..."`
`"...Eh...?"`
`Satoshi-kun tried to say something but hesitated.`
`...He was breathing so heavily...`
` Was he sick?`
`"...Hey...`
` do you feel all right, Satoshi-kun?"`
`"...Uh... sorry.`
` ...I'm fine."`
`"...I guess you're tired.`
` I think you should get some rest."`
`He sounded distinctly more sickly from when this conversation had started.`
`He breathed heavily when punctuating his words.`
`Satoshi-kun repeated his question.`
`"...Mion,`
` I'll ask you one more time...`
` Do you believe in Oyashiro-sama's curse...?"`
`...What did he want me to say?`
`...Could I make him feel relieved with my answer? How should I respond?`
`...The answer was simple.`
`"...Ahahahahaha.`
` ...There's no curse. There can't possibly be."`
`I didn't know what was bothering him.`
`But I wanted to make him feel better by laughing his worries away.`
`"....................."`
`But Satoshi-kun instead fell silent.`
`...Would my answer make him happy? Or maybe sad?`
` I couldn't tell.`
`One thing was certain... I didn't make him feel any better.`
`"...Sorry that I asked such a weird question."`
`"Ah... uh... sorry..."`
`I felt like I let him down, so I apologized in a rush.`
`"...Whether it's a real curse or somebody's conspiracy...`
` I won't disappear, and I won't fall victim to it."`
`"Y-You won't disappear..."`
`"No...`
` not until I buy that teddy bear.`
` I'll get the money pretty soon.`
` I won't go anywhere until then."`
`He chuckled.`
`I knew he was trying to relieve me, but it worked the opposite way.`
`...He sounded as though he didn't care what would happen after he bought the teddy bear.`
`"...Oh... my aunt is home. I have to go."`
`"Oh... okay."`
`"...Mion."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Even though he wanted to hang up the phone because of his aunt coming back--`
`...Satoshi-kun took a breath to tell me something important.`
`"I'll leave...`
` Satoko to you."`
`I should've said yes right away.`
`...But I still couldn't forgive Satoko...`
` so I just kept quiet.`
`"....................."`
`"...Forget what I said...`
` Bye."`
`"Oh."`
`He was obviously disappointed.`
`What had I done?`
`I wanted to apologize.`
` I wished I could.`
`But... it was too late.`
`The dial tone left no doubt. Now that was depressing.`
