`"Wow, Mion never keeps her appointments...`
` I mean, honestly."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Making my sister the standard for everything will get you in trouble."`
`"Mm?`
` You're a little unsteady.`
` You were drinking last night too, weren't you?`
` Don't try to hide it!`
` You definitely went home from school early."`
`"Ooh, too bad!`
` I've been at home all day from the beginning.`
` I'm smarter than my sis, after all."`
`"Hey now...`
` I don't think you can call playing hooky 'smarter'..."`
`"You should finish your errand first.`
` We don't have that much time.`
` ...We're going to the library, right?"`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` My mom had to return some books by today.`
` ...Is the library far?"`
`"No, it's right nearby."`
`I meant it when I said we didn't have much time.`
` I had to hurry a little.`
`I was just going to talk to him on the phone, but I ended up coming all the way to Okinomiya.`
`After our talk, Keiichi would slowly head back to Hinamizawa on his bicycle.`
`I'd have to rush back there while making sure I didn't run into him.`
`Otherwise, I couldn't make it on time for the meeting.`
`Maybe I could be a little late, but since I needed to hear everything they were going to discuss, I didn't want to be.`
`This was the Shishibone Public Library.`
`It was sizeable, filled with a collection of moldy, smelly books.`
`But they did have air conditioning, and it was quiet. It was the perfect place for when you wanted to be alone.`
`After Satoshi-kun disappeared last year, I came here a lot to think about various things.`
`This was where`
` I first met Takano-san.`
`I didn't want to run into her with Keiichi in tow...`
`But then I remembered that she was already dead.`
`The first floor of the building was occupied by government offices.`
`The library itself was on the second floor, so we had to walk up a huge staircase to get there.`
`I tasted cool air on my skin as soon as I walked through the automated door.`
`Unlike outside, it was very quiet in here.`
`The room temperature was both comfortable and suitable for books.`
`I could smell the scent of old pages...`
`"All libraries smell the same..."`
`Keiichi walked up to the return table after he said so.`
`Because it was a weekday, there was hardly anyone around.`
` It really was very quiet.`
`I was going to chat about some ordinary things,`
` and then move on to the main subject.`
`After Keiichi returned the books, I invited him into the inner section of the library.`
`Keiichi knew Mion well, but he didn't know me at all.`
` He showed an interest in our life story.`
`This was exactly where Takano-san told me about the true history of Hinamizawa a year ago. I was about to tell Keiichi about things that were very similar to that.`
` Did God have a sense of irony?`
`"...Now that you mention it...`
` That toy store looked like it was managed by relatives as well.`
` Does that mean they operate Angel Mort too?"`
`I told him the reason why the Sonozaki family was so powerful in this area.`
`I assumed that since Keiichi came from the city, there was a good chance he couldn't even begin to understand how one old family could literally control an entire area.`
`Unless I explained to him how powerful the Sonozaki family was, he wouldn't understand what kind of danger was barreling toward him.`
`"The family is particularly strong in finance and real estate.`
` Even a lot of members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry either have the last name Sonozaki, or are their relatives.  `
`There are Sonozakis in the city council and the prefectural assembly too, since they have the Okinomiya area giving them strong electoral support."`
`"...Wait a minute.`
` ...This is all... escalating pretty quickly.`
` Your relatives operate shops in downtown Okinomiya, and they're especially strong in finance and real estate...? `
`On top of that, a lot of people in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry are relatives, and there are even some elected to local offices...?"`
`Keiichi counted with his fingers. He was clearly surprised to hear all that about the Sonozaki family.`
`It seemed he was flexible enough to accept even something that sounded outrageous to him.`
`He was starting to understand things, although slowly. The way he viewed Shion Sonozaki was changing little by little too.`
`That should be enough background information. Now I could go on to explain about Mion Sonozaki, the successor.`
`Then I'd change the subject, like Takano-san did with me.`
`I'd go on to talk about the curse of Oyashiro-sama and then the series of mysterious deaths...`
`"So then...`
` ...The Sonozaki family, it's... it's pretty famous in this area...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Crazy, isn't it?`
` Nfu fu fu fu!"`
`A fat man with a cigarette suddenly cut into our conversation.`
`Ooishi?`
`Why was he here?`
`"Hello!`
` Good afternoon.`
` Are you on a date today?`
` Ah, what I would give to be young again."`
`"If you thought we were on a date, then why are you bothering us,`
` Ooishi-san?"`
`What timing.`
` It couldn't be coincidence.`
`I knew this man too well.`
`He was crafty, sly, and clever.`
`His presence here just can't be a coincidence.`
`Did he see us somewhere in town and follow us?`
`But why?`
`Did he need something from me, Keiichi, or perhaps the both of us?`
`From what I could guess, I didn't think it was me that he wanted something from.`
`It was almost like he was trying to keep Keiichi away from me.`
`Ooishi was aware I gave false testimony to protect Satoshi-kun last year.`
`Maybe he didn't think he could talk to Keiichi if I was around.`
`Why did Ooishi need to talk to Keiichi?`
`It must be about the incident from yesterday.`
`I'm sure there were plenty of plainclothes officers at the festival, so they had to have seen who was last with the victims.`
`In other words, Keiichi and me.`
`But Ooishi knew I was hard to deal with.`
`That was why he was focusing on Keiichi at present.`
` Why did he have to show up at a time like this?`
`"Maebara-san, right?`
` You're one tough guy.`
` Two-timing the Sonozaki sisters, are you?"`
`"No, I... I'm not two-timing anyone..."`
`Keiichi looked at me, hoping for assistance.`
`He blushed. The way he panicked reminded me of Satoshi-kun.`
`That aside, this wasn't going well.`
`Ooishi might even start talking about my relationship with Satoshi-kun.`
`I didn't want him to, nor did I want Keiichi to have any preconceptions.`
`Ooishi took a quick glance at me.`
`His eyes told me something.`
`He was purposefully talking about the things I'd rather not talk about.`
`He was basically telling me to leave or he'd continue on to something that was worse than what they were currently talking about.`
` He didn't use words, but his eyes clearly communicated that anyway.`
`Damn that big fat weasel...`
`"Ah, I'm sorry, Kei-chan.`
` ...I really do need to get to my job."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh... you do?"`
`I realized that I wouldn't achieve anything like this, even if I stayed longer, so I used my part-time job as an excuse to leave.`
`Ooishi looked at me and grinned.`
`Damn it...`
` He won today, but I'll win next time.`
`"Wait... Didn't you have something to talk about today,`
` Shion?"`
`"Yep. I'll see you later...`
` Oh, I'll give you a call after I'm done.`
` It'll be okay to call at night, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Probably okay."`
`"Then I'll talk to you later tonight.`
` Bye!"`
