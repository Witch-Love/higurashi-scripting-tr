`My relatives gathered at the Sonozaki house after the festival to have a little party.`
`I mingled with my uncles and had fun.`
`...I was trying to get rid of my eerie memories of the ritual storehouse.`
`Mion was acting as the successor, so I tried to stay away from her.`
`I'm sure she would feel weird if I talked to her in a formal way.`
`In consideration of the hag's old age, we ended the party around 11 PM.`
`We all helped to clean up, with the women washing the dishes in the kitchen...`
`And the men folding the tables and putting them away in a storeroom.`
`It only took about thirty minutes. Then everyone left, one after another.`
`By then Mion was no longer acting as the Sonozaki successor and was back to being her normal self.`
`"Sis, can I spend the night here?`
` I just want to sleep..."`
`"Granny will get mad if she finds you...`
`By the way, don't you have school tomorrow, Shion?"`
`"No, tomorrow is our school's anniversary, so there's no class...`
` ...Mmm..."`
`"How many times a year does your school have its anniversary?`
`Oh well...`
` Okay, Kasai-san.`
` She can stay here tonight."`
`"Understood.`
` Good night."`
`"Come on, Shion, wake up. Granny will get really mad if you fall asleep here.`
` Here, hold on to me.`
` You can sleep in my room."`
`"Y'whaaa?... Sis... uhhnnn..."`
`I didn't remember much after that.`
`I was probably brought to Mion's room and immediately crawled into the futon.`
`After a while, Mion got her futon ready next to me, turned the lights off, and went to sleep... At least, that's what I'd thought...`
`I got up and turned the lights on.`
`Mion's futon was empty.`
`The futon felt cold.`
`Mion must have left it a while ago.`
`Did she go to the bathroom?`
`No, the closest bathroom was right there down the hallway.`
`The light in the bathroom was off.`
`Where did she go?`
`The ticking of the clock was loud and annoying in this silence.`
`The hands pointed... to a little before 3 AM.`
`I was left alone all of a sudden... in this late night.`
`I tried to sense my surroundings; in this house, there shouldn't be an eerie atmosphere,`
` strange noises,`
` or footsteps.`
`I stepped out into the freezing cold hallway to look for Mion...`
`When I did, I immediately noticed light coming from one of the nearby rooms. `
`That room belonged to the hag.`
`The hag went to sleep early and woke up early.`
`She was very strict about her bedtime.`
` So it was strange to see her light on in the middle of the night.`
`I could hear voices too.`
` Those voices belonged to the hag... and Mion.`
`I creeped up to the room and listened to their conversation.`
`Since it was the middle of the night, I could hear their words very clearly.`
`"But you know...`
` those young ones went too far."`
`"You're right.`
` They made Oyashiro-sama angry, so I guess they got what they deserved."`
`Mion's voice sounded as cold as the one I'd heard down in the torture room. I held my breath.`
`"The police say they are investigating, but are you sure?"`
`"...I guess.`
` It's probably Takano-san."`
`My heart almost stopped.`
`Oyashiro-sama got angry.`
`The police are investigating.`
`It's probably Takano-san.`
` And what day was it today.`
`Those words told me that something was happening.`
`My teeth started to chatter. I desperately tried to stop them.`
`I felt like my body was swelling up suddenly. I could no longer hear as well.`
`Calm down. Breathe.`
` Listen more carefully...`
`According to Mion and the hag's conversation, another incident definitely took place.`
`The victims were... Takano-san and Tomitake-san...`
`From what I could tell, both Mion and the hag thought it made sense that whatever it was happened to them.`
`No, no, no, no... I needed to think more calmly...`
`They did say they deserved it for making Oyashiro-sama angry.`
`Did they say Takano-san and Tomitake-san made Oyashiro-sama angry?`
`How did they make Oyashiro-sama angry?`
`............They knew.`
`My body started to shake.`
`They knew we snuck into the ritual storehouse...`
`Then would that mean... Keiichi and I`
` were also subject to Oyashiro-sama's curse?`
`Suddenly a phone rang.`
`The phone was by the front door.`
`The front door was opposite the hag's room, farther down the hall.`
`The ringing echoed throughout the long hallway. It sounded so eerie, almost like it was coming from Hell...`
`That was when`
`......`
` I felt`
` someone behind me.`
`Of course, there was nobody there when I turned around.`
` But there was someone there a moment ago.`
`I didn't know if it was Satoshi-kun.`
`I didn't sense any emotions, so I couldn't tell.`
`I also didn't know how long it had been there.`
`It was as if that somebody was watching me listen in on their conversation.`
` That was the feeling I got.`
`It couldn't be Satoshi-kun.`
`Satoshi-kun would never be that intimidating or scary.`
`My mind turned all red, like it was suffused with blood.`
`"...Have you experienced anything like that?`
` Those footsteps always followed me......`
` They even came to my bedside`
` and looked down at me."`
`I remembered what Rena Ryuugu had said on that rainy day.`
`"You'll be okay, if that's true......`
` Oyashiro-sama won't get mad at you."`
`If Oyashiro-sama wasn't angry,`
` nobody would follow me.`
`So what did this mean?`
` Ever since we snuck into the shrine storage`
` something has been following me?`
` What is it?`
`Calm down, calm down...`
`That's right. Rena wasn't talking about me.`
`She was talking about Satoshi-kun! That's what happened to Satoshi-kun!`
`"Everything he's going through... is a sign of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`That's right. That's why he encountered the curse of Oyashiro-sama...`
`"......You feel someone is watching from a distance...`
` and it follows you..."`
`A creepy feeling crawled up and spread across my back.`
`"Then it watches from right behind you...`
` ...After that, you start hearing an extra footstep."`
`I swallowed loudly.`
`It's almost as though Rena Ryuugu was predicting what would happen to me...`
`Had Rena been talking about Satoshi-kun back then?`
` Or had she actually been talking about me...?`
`"But you start hearing it even inside your house after a while.`
` Then... Oyashiro-sama keeps watching you even when you're sleeping in the dark...`
` right by your side,`
` waiting silently..."`
`I knew by now that there was no mistake...`
`No matter how I looked at it,`
` she had been talking about me.`
` Yes, me.`
` It had been about me!`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama... What is the curse of Oyashiro-sama?`
`That was when I actually felt something for real.`
`Someone grabbed my collar.`
`"Ah.........!!"`
`No voice came out.`
`I wanted to scream, but all I could do was to open and close my mouth, as if something was stuck in my throat...`
`It was Mion...`
`She looked even colder than how she'd looked in the underground torture room.`
`It only made sense`
` that she'd come out into the hallway to answer the phone.`
`I tried to come up with an excuse...`
`However, the way Mion looked at me was so cold.`
`Even if I really had run into her by accident, I could tell by the look in her eyes that she wouldn't believe me.`
`I felt cold sweat all over my body. I couldn't even move my fingers.`
`"S... Sorry..."`
`I apologized.`
`I could have said something to get myself out of the situation, but the apology came out first.`
`But Mion didn't appear to hear me.`
`She walked to the front door, still holding my collar.`
`The phone was still ringing.`
`A normal person doesn't usually let a phone ring so long at this time of night.`
` The phone call itself didn't seem real to me.`
`Mion picked up the phone.`
`"This is Mion.`
` ............`
`...I see.`
` I understand.`
` Please take care of things at your end.`
` Also, please make sure that nobody talks about this.`
` ...Yes.`
` Goodbye."`
`Mion put down the phone after a short conversation.`
`What did she mean, make sure nobody talks about this?`
`Who called any... way?! ............!!!`
`Mion put her forehead to mine and spoke to me.`
`"Did you hear?"`
`Which conversation was she asking me about?!`
`Well, she had to be talking about the one with the hag.`
`If I said yes, what would happen to me?`
`"...I...`
` don't...`
` ahaha...`
` I don't know`
` what you're talking about...`
` Ahhhh...!"`
`Mion pulled my collar, pressed her nose on mine, and continued to speak.`
`"Just what you heard.`
` The curse of Oyashiro-sama fell upon Tomitake-san and Takano-san.`
` It's really very unfortunate..."`
`It was like I was talking to myself in a mirror.`
`But what I was saying in the mirror was ever so cold.`
`"...Sis...`
` Ahaha...`
` what is`
` the curse of Oyashiro-sama?"`
`"Tomitake-san killed himself by clawing out his throat.`
` Takano-san was burned to death in an oil drum.`
` ...Terrible, isn't it."`
`Tomitake-san clawed at his own throat until he died?`
`What?`
`Takano-san was burned to death in an oil drum?`
`What? What??`
`I felt something furry crawl up my spine.`
`I also felt like my stomach was turning upside down.`
`I didn't feel any strength in my legs. If Mion let go of my collar, I'd probably collapse on the spot.`
`"Wh, Why`
` did they die`
` that way?"`
`"Don't you know, Shion?"`
`I'm asking you because I don't know...`
`"I, I don't know... Ahahaha..."`
`"Don't you see there can be only one reason?"`
`Please don't talk as if I already know the answer...`
`"What do you mean?"`
`My heart was pounding.`
` I felt that my next breath would be so bloody and hot that I'd choke on it...`
`"Don't you know?"`
`"It's because they made Oyashiro-sama angry."`
`The first year, it was the manager of the dam construction site.`
`The second year it was the traitors to the village.`
`The third year it was the pacifist.`
`The fourth year it was the relatives of the traitors.`
`I'd always thought the victims were people who had something to do with the dam conflict.`
`Since I didn't do anything against the village during the dam conflict,`
` I assumed I was safe.`
`I should have known.`
`I should have known everything would be the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`I knew Oyashiro-sama's anger was the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`I knew Oyashiro-sama would get angry if I snuck into the ritual storehouse.`
`But since I wasn't held responsible in any way for the dam conflict, I never thought I would be a victim of the curse.`
`Did I ever think there would be an incident in the fifth year?`
`Did I ever think that I'd be the victim of that fifth-year incident?!`
`Tomitake-san snuck into the storehouse, and he clawed at his own throat until he died!`
`Takano-san was burned to death in an oil drum!`
` It must be a lie, it couldn't be true.`
`Even if it was forbidden, it was just a space for storing some old torture implements!`
` How could they be killed for just sneaking in there?!`
` Especially in such gruesome ways?!`
`But I thought about it again and realized`
` that those people were absolutely capable of doing things like that.`
`The main Sonozaki family was capable of it.`
`The Sonozaki family had been pulling the strings behind the series of mysterious deaths. They could do it.`
`The Sonozaki family even kidnapped the grandson of the Minister of Construction during the dam conflict. They could do it.`
`The Sonozaki family made Satoshi-kun disappear completely.`
` They could do it.`
`Mion leaned against me`
` before falling onto the cold hallway floor.`
`She collapsed rather violently.`
`I usually didn't go to sleep with my stun gun.`
`I had my stun gun on me.`
`I finally understood.`
`I didn't know who killed them exactly.`
`Whose idea it was or who ordered it.`
`I didn't even know who was actually involved.`
`But Mion and the hag knew everything.`
`Satoshi-kun.`
` Now I finally know.`
`Now I know what I need to do.`
`I will settle the score for you, Satoshi-kun.`
`I will avenge you, Satoshi-kun.`
`I won't be killed like you, Satoshi-kun.`
`I walked into the hag's room.`
`She was sitting up to take some medicine. Her back was turned to me.`
`Mion and I are twins.`
`If I acted like her, the hag wouldn't notice the difference.`
`I didn't think she ever suspected me.`
`I put my stun gun to her neck,`
` and pulled the trigger.`
`I heard an indescribable electrical sound, and the hag's lights went out.`
`She fell in a twisted position.`
`I didn't know how long it would take a person to regain their freedom of movement after getting knocked out with a stun gun.`
`So I had to restrain them before they woke back up.`
`I was unbelievably calm.`
`The key to the underground torture room`
` was in the forbidden drawer that only the head of the family can access. Mion had told me about this once.`
`I'd never looked for the drawer before, but I found it exactly where I thought it would be.`
`The key was on a keychain with several of its sisters. Each key had a little plaque on it that said what it was used for.`
`They were all in Mion's handwriting.`
`She was an idiot for being so conscientious, but it sure helped me out.`
`I put the keychain in my pocket and headed to the outdoor storeroom to find a cart.`
`I found a large flashlight there as well.`
`There was a strap on the flashlight so I could put it on my shoulder.`
`That way, I'd have both hands free to carry Mion and the hag.`
`I loaded Mion and then our grandmother onto the cart and carried them to the underground torture room.`
`I was prepared to use the stun gun again if they woke up while I was working...`
` but it was more powerful than I imagined, and the hag showed no signs of waking.`
`This was the stun gun Kasai specially ordered for me when I told him I wanted a powerful one.`
`I remembered him telling me that it was an illegally modified stun gun and that I should never use it just for fun.`
`I used my flashlight to find the light switch.`
`I found it easily and turned it on.`
`All the lights went on in the basement.`
`Although there was now illumination, it was very dim.`
`I moved quickly so as to finish what I needed to do before they woke up.`
`I decided to put Mion in a cell beyond the torture room.`
`The lights in the torture room were so bright that it was like daylight.`
`There was a door there. I was fairly certain the cells were on the other side of that door.`
`The proper key was... here.`
`The keys made a tinkling sound.`
`I felt cold air coming in through the gap in the door.`
`There must be a huge opening on the other side.`
`I opened the door and I saw nothing but darkness.`
`I felt along the wall to find a light switch.`
`I turned the switch on... and the light bulbs lit up, revealing a huge rocky cave.`
`It didn't look like a natural cave. It looked more like an air-raid shelter.`
`There were several hollow openings with bars across them.`
` Those were the cells.`
`I walked up to the closest cell, and checked to see if it was strong enough to confine her.`
`I pushed and pulled on the bars.`
`I rammed against them with all my weight, and decided they were perfectly sturdy.`
`This was secure enough to be called a cell. `
`I opened the lock and carried Mion in.`
`I wasn't particularly strong. Just average.`
`I'd never thought I was strong enough to carry a whole person.`
`But now I didn't need to pretend to be weak. I could easily lift and drag their bodies.`
`I put Mion in the cell.`
`She seemed to moan a little.`
`I didn't need to check to make sure. The effect of my stun gun was wearing off.`
`I closed the bars and turned the key in the lock. Then I ran to the hag, who must've been starting to wake up too.`
`Fortunately, there was no sign of her regaining consciousness.`
`Maybe the difference in age had something to do with it.`
`I looked for a table to restrain her on.`
`I found a wheelchair with restraints for the hands and feet. I put the hag in it.`
`Of course she didn't resist, but her dead weight made it seem like she was a huge French doll, but one made of flesh.`
`I put her hands on the armrests, and restrained them at the wrists with the metal rings and hinges.`
`I did the same with her feet.`
`This must've been a wheelchair specially remodeled to restrain a person. Other than the restraints, it was a regular wheelchair.`
`I waited for the hag to wake up.`
`I had so many things I wanted to ask her.`
`I didn't think she'd answer honestly, but I had plenty of tools to make her talk.`
` I was in no rush.`
`When the hag had a concern, relatives took care of the problem.`
`That was how it worked in the Sonozaki family.`
`She was the leader of the family, so all the information they gathered would make its way to her.`
`She must know everything that happened in Hinamizawa.`
`Including the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`I heard a noise from the cell.`
`Mion must have woken up before the hag did.`
`Speaking of the hag, she didn't seem like she was about to wake up anytime soon, but she was restrained even if she did, so I had no need to fear.`
`I left the hag there and headed for the cell.`
`"...Shion, what do you think you're doing?"`
`She talked like the successor, but she also sounded frightened. She obviously understood the situation she was in right now.`
`"Good morning, Mion.`
` You never thought you'd be in there, huh?`
` Ahahaha."`
`"As the acting head, I order you.`
` Open this up."`
`"Ahahahaha, you don't sound so scary in there. You need to talk more like a leader, don't you think?`
` Though, talking that way will only make you look like a fool.`
` Ahahahahaha!"`
`There was nothing funny about it, but I wanted to intimidate Mion.`
`My laughter echoed throughout the cave.`
`It was artificial and meaningless laughter.`
`I heard it over and over as it echoed.`
`It sounded as if I wasn't the only one laughing.`
`I couldn't stand it, so I stopped.`
`Silence filled the air.`
` That silence almost hurt my ears, so I started to speak.`
`"Tomitake-san and Takano-san becoming the victims this year.`
` I didn't expect that..."`
`"......"`
`"What an idea to burn Takano-san to death.`
` But actually, she would be the kind of person who'd prefer to die that way.`
` Maybe she's satisfied, huh?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`Mion didn't say anything. She just stared at me to see how I'd proceed.`
`Mion didn't reply.`
`I was smiling boldly, but I became impatient and finally kicked the bars.`
`It made a violent noise.`
`Mion jumped as if she was kicked directly.`
`"It's boring not to get any answers. Do you have any idea what will happen if I get angry?"`
`"H-How... How would I know...?"`
`Mion finally replied.`
`She was odious, but at the same time, sounded pitiful.`
`"Hey, Mion.`
` As the successor,`
` why don't you tell me?`
` ...Let's see..."`
`I had just too many things I wanted to ask her.`
`I wanted to ask her about me,`
` about the incident,`
` about the curse,`
` about Satoshi-kun.`
`I didn't even know where to start.`
`Before I asked her about those, I asked her one other thing.`
`"You know there's no point in trying to resist, don't you?"`
`"............"`
`Mion glared at me silently.`
`Because we were twins, I knew that was just a bluff.`
`"We've come this far, so there's no point in me hesitating anymore.`
` You shouldn't expect hesitation or even mercy from me, Sis."`
`Mion must've been feeling the cold sweat on her face.`
`Although the light was dim, I could tell she was frightened.`
`"Okay, here I go.`
` First, about the series of the mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa`
` also known as the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
` What's the meaning of it?`
` Is it to signify the end of the dam conflict?"`
`"......`
`I...`
` hmmm...`
` I think so......"`
`Mion sounded a little confused, but she answered.`
`I felt satisfaction now that we were communicating. I continued with a smile.`
`"You think, huh?`
` Don't you know the details?"`
`"You know yourself`
` that the successor is simply a messenger for Granny..."`
`Yeah, right.`
`"But the successor must know everything the current head is thinking, right?`
` Do you really think I believe you're just a messenger?"`
`"......Although I'm always around Granny, I don't always know what she's thinking.`
` It's not like I can understand her all the time."`
`"Okay, so you're saying that everything about the curse of Oyashiro-sama is decided by the hag herself, right?`
` I assumed she'd talk to the successor about it."`
`"When it's something dangerous, Granny decides it on her own.`
` I don't have anything to do with it."`
`"No...!`
` ...She doesn't use me for that.`
` ......I really don't understand it myself,`
` but it's like I take care of problems on the surface and someone else takes care of problems on the underside."`
`"...Who?`
` Who is the one that takes care of these 'underside problems'?"`
`"I don't know..."`
`"Haven't you seen anyone? Haven't you overheard a phone conversation?`
` It must be someone who gets in touch with the hag at the same time every year, around the time the curse happens."`
`"I don't know.`
` I really don't..."`
`Mion shook her head.`
`"Okay,`
` let me change the question.`
` Why were Tomitake-san and Takano-san chosen as victims, even though they had nothing to do with the dam conflict?`
` Was it because they snuck into the ritual storehouse?"`
`As soon as Mion heard the words "ritual storehouse," her expression shifted.`
`"The ritual storehouse?`
` Did they intrude on the storehouse at the Furude Shrine?"`
`"Didn't you know?`
` I thought you already knew."`
`"If they really did that`
` then it was truly stupid of them... Of course something would happen to them!"`
`Mion muttered bitterly while shaking her head repeatedly.`
`Mion's reaction made me realize the true meaning of the forbidden storehouse for ritual implements.`
`The ritual storehouse is a sacred building, so nobody can go inside. The curse will fall upon any who disobey.`
`Any child would know that rule.`
`However, just because they knew about it didn't mean that they all believed in it.`
`Although they were told they would be cursed, most of the kids actually enjoyed hearing the stories.`
` They simply didn't believe it was true.`
`However, Mion's reaction told me it absolutely was.`
`If they actually did that... of course something would happen to them.`
`She was saying that if someone snuck into the ritual storehouse,`
` that person should be killed.`
`"What you know and what I know aren't matching up anymore.`
`Of course I'm aware I shouldn't just waltz into the storehouse.`
` But to be killed in such a gruesome way for doing it?`
` I never knew that. Did you?"`
`"That's just because you're ignorant about it, Shion."`
`"Well, sorry for being ignorant...`
` Could you please explain it to me?"`
`"Just like you said, the kids don't really believe in the curse.`
` They assume it's just superstition. But they also know that if an adult found out, they'd be in big trouble.`
`But... to the elderly people of Hinamizawa, it's something more serious...!"`
`Mion explained to me how the elderly people blindly believe in Oyashiro-sama, and how sacred the festivals are to them.`
`It's probably something the younger generations would never understand, but they're possessed by a very strong, deeply rooted devotion toward Oyashiro-sama.`
`Mion then went on to tell me about how sinful it was to violate the rule of the ritual storehouse.`
`I just couldn't believe things like that were still going on even in the modern day.`
`I couldn't even reply appropriately.`
`But...`
` even if it was unbelievable, I couldn't ignore what I was hearing from my twin sister...`
`"I see...`
` But Mion...`
`Doesn't the rule say that one victim gets killed by the curse and another has to become a sacrifice?`
` The body of the sacrifice is never to be found.`
` But there are two dead bodies this time. `
`What do you think of that?"`
`Mion doesn't know that besides Takano-san and Tomitake-san, Keiichi and I also snuck into the ritual storehouse.`
` So I tried to lead her a little.`
`"I know...`
` that doesn't make sense."`
`"Maybe Takano-san's burned body wasn't supposed to be found.`
` Maybe the intention was for her to vanish."`
`"...Or...`
` ...hmmm,`
` I'm not too sure, but..."`
`"What?`
` Just say what you're thinking. I won't get mad."`
`Mion hesitated a little first and then started to speak.`
`"Actually, four people snuck into the shrine storage... so maybe..."`
`"Hmm......?`
` Maybe what?"`
`"Maybe the other two will become the sacrifices and get demoned away..."`
