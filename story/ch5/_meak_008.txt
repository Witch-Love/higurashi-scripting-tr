`"President, if you would."`
`...For a moment, I forgot that the class president was me.`
`"Uh, uh, uh uh!`
` All rise!!"`
`"Looks like you didn't get enough sleep.`
` I know it's been very hot at night lately,`
` but try to get as much sleep as you can.`
` All right, everyone?"`
`"Yes, ma'am!"`
`...I'm not sure this place can be called a school.`
`Because there are so many different age groups,`
` it's like a kindergarten and an elementary school blended together.`
`Since I'd heard already about what this place was like, I didn't feel that uncomfortable.`
`It wasn't too difficult to act like Mion here.`
`As Sis told me... Satoshi-kun looked exhausted.`
`I said hi to him, but he ignored me.`
`...Since I knew what he'd been going through, his pain looked apparent to me.`
`I was interested in another person in this classroom.`
`Satoko... Satoshi-kun's little sister.`
`She looked as worn out as Satoshi-kun... Emotionless, like an abandoned doll.`
`Everybody in this room was aware of their circumstances, but no one could do anything for them...`
` So they just acted as though nothing was wrong.`
`Mion will only let me have this one day.`
`...If I slacked off even a little bit, today would be over with quickly.`
`I had to figure out what I should do in this limited time.`
`I should probably talk to Satoshi-kun.`
`About what?`
`Anything goes...`
` Cheer him up, sympathize with him... anything will do.`
` More than anything, I just wanted to chat with him.`
`However, Sis had told me.`
`......She said Satoshi-kun didn't communicate much with her lately,`
` and had distanced himself from her.`
`I figured I shouldn't talk to him too casually.`
`...I wanted to, but...`
` maybe it was better to leave him alone......`
`I needed to keep Sis's warnings in mind...`
`But instead... I decided to ignore them.`
`I looked for Satoshi-kun during lunch break. He was walking as if looking for a place where he could be alone. I caught him in the hallway.`
`"......Satoshi-kun."`
`He turned around, startled by my voice.`
`His facial expression surprised me.`
`...He was scowling. Clearly a sign of rejection.`
`But... I couldn't hesitate.`
`...I'd lose my only chance if I did.`
`"...Hey, um...`
` How are you?"`
`He gave me a look as if saying`
` 'do I look fine to you?'`
`...I never expected to see an expression like that on his face.`
`I felt like my heart was being torn into pieces...`
`As I looked down, he spoke to me.`
`...I felt a little glad, but the next thing he said changed that.`
`"...I'm fine...`
` Is there anything else?"`
`"Eh...?"`
`"...I'll get going if there isn't...`
` because I want to be alone."`
`"O-Okay...`
` I guess you're tired from work.`
` I'm sure you want some time to yourself...`
` You're working today too, right?`
` Where at?"`
`Sis had found several jobs for him.`
`He worked at a few different places.`
` He was helping out when necessary at any of the shops Mion introduced him to.`
`As a result, he constantly had to do different tasks in a different environment almost every time.`
`On top of that, he requested high-paying jobs from Mion because he wanted a large sum of money as soon as possible.`
`In other words, he chose to mostly do manual labor...`
` He was exhausted every day because he wasn't that physically strong.`
`"......Does it matter?`
` ...And shouldn't you know, because you helped me get the job?"`
`...Mion did help him get the job...`
` yet Satoshi-kun didn't look thankful for that opportunity.`
`...This wasn't like him at all......`
` It made me feel sad.`
`"...Hahahaha. You're right...`
` Sorry."`
`"...Is that all?"`
`He sounded so harsh.`
`...Why was he being like that?`
`Would he ever stroke my head again...?`
`".........Ooh..."`
`I couldn't help my tears.`
`They flowed onto my cheeks.`
`Satoshi-kun looked confused for a moment, but then he frowned again.`
`"...Uh,`
` sorry...`
`...`
` Uh...`
` the coach said...`
` he wanted you to come back to practice......`
` Ahahaha......"`
`"...I told him I quit...`
` so I won't be going back."`
`"B-But maybe...`
` it's a good idea to work out from time to time,`
` you know...?"`
`"Not interested."`
`I didn't know why he was being so hostile towards me.`
`...Why did he hate me so much? I was left bewildered.`
`"...Why...?`
` How come...?"`
`"...Because I'm busy with work.`
` Isn't it obvious?"`
`"...No, I didn't mean that!!`
` Why do you hate me so much?!"`
`"...Why don't you ask yourself?"`
`"Ask myself?!`
` What?!`
` What did I do?!`
` I don't understand, Satoshi-kun!!"`
`I couldn't control my emotions any longer.`
`Streaks of tears ran down my cheeks.`
`...Satoshi-kun gave me a hateful glare, and walked away without saying another word.`
`I couldn't even stop him.`
`...If I tried, he'd hurt me again with another cutting remark.`
`...I couldn't bear that...`
` So I just watched him walk away.`
`I wiped my tears and... went back to the classroom.`
`I heard somebody crying from inside.`
`...What's going on? I looked around the room to see.`
`......It was`
` Satoko.`
`I saw her bento box on the floor.`
`I asked one of her classmates what happened... and it seemed that Satoko had bumped into somebody's shoulder when she stood up to go wash the box out...`
` That was all.`
`But... Satoko was crying as if afraid she was going to be chided badly.`
`What happened was very minor.`
`...She could just pick up the bento box and things would be fine.`
`...It looked like the lid came a little loose, but it was definitely fixable...`
` She didn't have to cry like that.`
`Yet Satoko... started begging through her tears.`
`"Help! Help me, Nii-nii!!`
` Waaaaahhhhhhh!!!"`
`Because of what happened with Satoshi-kun, I couldn't suppress my emotions very well.`
`...So, instead, they exploded.`
`I stormed up to Satoko while elbowing her classmates aside.`
`I grabbed her by the head...`
` then threw her into the wall.`
`Satoko screamed. She didn't seem to understand what had happened.`
`She was shedding tears and shivering...`
` She must be wondering why I did that.`
`"...Do you know why I did that?"`
`"Eeeek... help...... Nii-nii......"`
`Satoko cried for her brother's help again...`
`And so, I grabbed her head and threw her again.`
`Satoko stumbled and crashed into a desk.`
` The desk fell and the contents of the drawer scattered about.`
`Satoko didn't even stand up.`
` She just crouched and trembled while looking up at me.`
`"Help... help...`
` ...Nii-nii...`
` ...Nii-nii..."`
`"If you weren't like that...!!!"`
`...If you weren't like that, Satoshi-kun wouldn't have to suffer. Don't you get it?!`
`That's what I wanted to say, but I was too angry to utter another word.`
`I picked up a bunch of textbooks from the floor and threw them at her face.`
`"Cry as much as you want!!`
` But nothing's going to change!!`
` Why are you crying?!`
` Because you think somebody's going to help you?!`
` You don't have any idea what he has to go through to protect you, do you?!!!`
`Do you understand that?!`
` Do you understand what you're doing?!`
`You shouldn't exist!!`
` Die if you don't want to suffer!!`
` Go fuck yourself!!!`
` Don't hurt Satoshi-kun!!`
` You deserve to die alone!!`
` You just deserve to dieeeeeee!!!"`
`"Waaaaahhhhh!!!`
` Nii-nii!!`
` Nii-nii!!!`
` Whaaaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`Her desperate cries only increased my irritation.`
`"Stop crying!!!`
` Don't call your brother for help!!`
` Stop it!!!`
` If you weren't like that...!!`
` If only you...!!!"`
`I kept on throwing things at her.`
`...Satoko curled up to protect herself, and cried even harder.`
`At that point, a girl with long hair ran up and huddled over her.`
`...I knew who that was.`
`...Rika Furude.`
` One of Satoko's only friends.`
`"......Please don't hurt her.`
` She's in a poor situation, so please don't hurt her..."`
`"It doesn't matter how pathetic she is!!`
` She shouldn't rely on Satoshi-kun all the time!!`
` Stop spoiling her!!`
` Satoshi-kun has to suffer so much because of her!!!"`
`"...No!!`
` Stop!!`
` Don't hurt her...!!"`
`Rika also became the target of my anger.`
`"I'm trying to teach her something here!!!`
` If you keep getting in the way, I'll crack your head open!!!"`
`I grabbed a chair and lifted it over my head.`
`It wouldn't hurt only a little if I threw this thing at them.`
`Rika tightly closed her eyes and covered Satoko with her body.`
`I didn't care what the consequences would be.`
`I didn't care if I hurt them.`
`"Stop!!`
` Mii-chan!!!!"`
`Rena returned to the classroom and shouted at me.`
`Then... Satoshi-kun rushed in while pushing Rena aside.`
`Seeming to have grasped the situation immediately...`
`He charged straight at me.`
`Until my body had hit the locker, I didn't understand what had happened.`
`There was a loud crashing noise. I'd left a dent in it......`
` I crouched there in pain.`
`"Satoko!!`
` Are you all right?!"`
`"Nii-nii!!`
` Nii-nii!!`
` Whaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Satoko pushed Rika aside, jumped at her brother... and started crying again.`
`"What happened...?`
` Why were you treated like that...?`
` Why...?!"`
`"I-`
`I didn't do anything but...`
` Mion-san... she suddenly...`
` Waaahhhh!!!"`
`"Wh-What's going on, Mion?!!!"`
`Satoshi-kun shouted at me while clutching his sister...`
` He looked fierce.`
`"I just......"`
`"What did Satoko do to deserve this?!`
` What did we do?!`
` Why do we always have to suffer like this?!`
` Why?!`
` Why?!!!"`
`He released Satoko and rushed up to me, grabbing me by the neck.`
`"You said... that I should ask myself, didn't you...?`
` So... why don't you ask yourself?"`
`"Ask what?!!!"`
`"I know you feel she's a burden on you......`
` You always have to suffer because of her. You know that, right?!`
` If she were stronger, you wouldn't have to suffer!!`
` She's the one to blame!!!"`
`I don't believe what I said was wrong.`
`But after hearing it, Satoshi-kun went berserk.`
`"Wh- Wh-`
` What the heck do you know?!!!"`
`"Ow... ahhh!!!"`
`Satoshi-kun grabbed my hair and threw me to the wall, just like I did to Satoko.`
`However, I wasn't going to back down.`
`...I no longer had any control over my emotions at all.`
`"You spent so much time protecting her!!!`
` She'll never stop relying on you until you stop doing that!!!"`
`"What the hell do you know about us?!`
` What the heck do you know?!`
` You persecuted our parents`
` and now it's us?`
` That's the way of the Sonozaki family, huh?!`
` You torture traitors for fun!!`
` Is it fun?! `
`Is it fun bullying us?!`
` Huh?!"`
`"Stop it!!!!"`
`That was Rena's voice.`
`She stepped in, looking as fierce as a demon.`
`"Satoshi-kun, please.`
` Mii-chan doesn't have any bad intentions.`
` ...She wanted to help you, but... she just lost control a little.`
` ...Okay?"`
`"....................."`
`Satoshi-kun looked like he wanted to say something back, but he chose not to.`
`"You too, Mii-chan...`
` I know how much you worry about Satoshi-kun.`
` But you can't solve the problem like that.`
` I think you understand. Right?"`
`Since Satoshi-kun didn't say anything, I kept quiet, too.`
`"Here, Satoko-chan.`
` You don't have to cry just because you dropped your bento box,`
` all right?`
` Do you feel better now?"`
`"......Satoko, I'll pick up the bento for you..."`
`"......Oooh... hic...... hic......!"`
`Rika started picking up the bento box while its owner continued to cry.`
`"Guys... can you help us clean up?`
` The teacher will be back from the vegetable garden soon.`
` This quarrel is over, so don't tell her about it,`
` okay?"`
`The classmates looked at each other and nodded... then started picking up the stuff on the floor.`
`"Here,`
` Satoshi-kun, Mii-chan, why don't you guys shake hands as a sign of reconciliation?`
` ...There."`
`".........Sorry...`
` I didn't mean to do this..."`
`Tears started to roll down my cheeks again.`
`"......I'm sorry,`
` too.`
` ......You have nothing to do with our family situation...`
` I'm sorry..."`
`"Mii-chan, you should apologize to Satoko-chan now.`
` Okay?"`
`...I was fine with apologizing to Satoshi-kun, but I didn't want to apologize to her.`
`But the situation wouldn't be settled otherwise... so I reluctantly apologized.`
`Satoko nodded, looking discouraged.`
`After that, Rena let me go. My head ached, so I held it with both hands.`
`...What was that...?`
` What did I do...?!`
`I didn't want to use this precious time to fight...!`
`Sis had warned me...`
`She told me that I shouldn't talk to Satoshi-kun just like that.`
`What did I come here for...?`
`...I shouldn't have come here if I knew this was going to happen.`
` Stupid, you're stupid, Shion!`
`I was overcome by emotions because I was so worried about Satoshi-kun.`
`When did things go wrong...? Were they wrong from the beginning?`
` I got into a fight with Satoshi-kun... This was totally the opposite of what I wanted.`
`I regretted it.`
`I hated myself for it.`
`...I couldn't blame myself enough.`
`My world had been torn apart.`
`...I wished the sky would fall and kill me......`
`Sis sounded both amazed and confused.`
`"...You know, I'm busy with the festival preparations...`
` but you certainly made things more complicated..."`
`"...Sorry."`
`Sis tried to say something, but she stopped in the middle.`
`...After listening to a few complaints, I started telling her about everything that happened today.`
`Sis had to pretend that the trouble I caused today was her responsibility, which must've been very taxing for her.`
`"...So I won't get the chance to trade spots for a while...?"`
`"...Hey...`
` ...I think you should be more aware of the hassle I have to go through..."`
`"......Yeah... you're right..."`
`Sis had been sympathetic, but... maybe I pushed her too far this time.`
`Of course she'd be hesitant to trade spots, considering what I did today...`
`The atmosphere felt awkward, so we were both silent for a while...`
`"...If you were to get another chance,`
` what would you do, Shion?"`
`...That was a reasonable question.`
`...I wasn't prepared to answer, though.`
`If I had a chance to go the school once again and see Satoshi-kun...`
` what would I do?`
`Would I apologize to him about today?`
`......I don't think that would work.`
` That might even upset him again, no matter how hard I tried.`
`...Okay,`
` here's something that he was saying.`
`......It was the Sonozaki family who had been harassing his.`
`It would only be natural for him to hold a grudge against us.`
`...But why was he only expressing that now?`
`...I've been a Sonozaki to him all along.`
`Satoshi-kun stroked my head even though he knew that I was Mion Sonozaki...`
`"...Sis,`
` do you think that Satoshi-kun is holding a grudge against the Sonozaki family...?"`
`"......I`
` think so, yes."`
`It was our family that initiated the persecution of the Houjou family,`
` making them into scapegoats.`
`Even after the dam conflict, it wasn't easy for the Houjou family to live in Hinamizawa.`
`Given all of that,`
` it's not surprising that Satoshi-kun hates us,`
` the Sonozaki family who put his family in a devastating situation. `
`"But...`
` why now?`
` Why is he only expressing that grudge to us now?"`
`"....................."`
`"...Why... is this happening now...?`
` If he wanted to...`
` ooohhh......`
` Ahhh...!!"`
`If he had rejected me in the first place...`
`...I wouldn't have wanted to get close to him.`
`My tears wet my cheeks. I didn't bother to wipe them.`
`...It's only natural for him to hold a grudge against the Sonozakis.`
` There's nothing unusual about it.`
`Rather...`
` why has he been treating me`
` like a friend?`
` I knew how stupid this question was...`
`"......I think...`
` it's because he was `
`mature`
`......"`
`"I-I can't... understand it`
`... `
`waaaaahhh...!!`
` Ahhhhh!!!"`
`He'd been treating me as a friend because he was mature?`
`...But now that he'd become stressed mentally and physically, he's decided to reject me...?`
`No matter how hard I thought about it,`
` I couldn't find anything to fault him with.`
`If there were somebody to blame... it'd be somebody I'd never accused before.`
`"...Why... did the hag decide to persecute the Houjou family...?"`
`"Eh?`
` ...Uh... um..."`
`"It was his parents who supported the dam project, right?`
` Satoshi-kun had nothing to do with it!`
` Why was he included?`
` Why?!"`
`Mion couldn't say anything in return.`
`Actually, it wasn't at all hard to guess the reason.`
`The hag didn't give any specific order to harass the Houjou family.`
`She <i>just thought</i> the Houjou family was getting in the way.`
`The people around her noticed what was bothering her, and took steps to get rid of it.`
`Though of course, she must have known how influential her own words were.`
`She didn't just think it. She gave what she must have known would be interpreted as an order.`
` ...She's the one to blame for initiating the attack on the Houjou family.`
`"You said before that the Furude priest wasn't mature because he didn't cooperate, right?`
` Is this the same scenario?!`
` The Houjou family wasn't mature because they didn't act in accordance with the other villagers? `
`That's why the hag decided to punish them,`
` isn't it?"`
`Mion couldn't say anything in return.`
`Meaning that my accusation was the truth.`
`"They already punished the Houjou couple!!`
` Feel free to bring them to the torture room in the garden,`
` and chop their fingers off or something,`
` but leave Satoshi-kun alone!!`
` Satoshi-kun has nothing to do with this!! `
`What did he do to deserve this?!`
` What did he do wrong?!`
` Answer me!!`
` Answer me!! Mion!!`
` Mion!!!"`
`"...Very well.`
` Please take care of the matter.`
`\nGoodbye."`
`Mion suddenly changed her tone and hung up.`
`She must have done that to escape from my questions. I was furious.`
`I started redialing the number,`
` but then I remembered that we'd decided she'd hang up the phone after using that phrase when she saw the hag coming.`
`...I doubted she actually saw the hag.`
`But it was the rule, so I couldn't call back for a while.`
`I went to the bathroom to wash my face and cool down.`
`I turned the faucet. The water felt lukewarm.`
`It didn't help me cool down at all.`
