`I was having such a happy dream.`
`Satoshi-kun was in the dream. He was leading his normal everyday life.`
`He was back on the baseball team.`
`Irie and I acted normally around him because we knew that's how mature people should act. We welcomed him back, as if he had been here with us the whole time.`
`Although he hits well in practice sessions, he still doesn't do well in a real game.`
`Come on, Satoshi-kun!!`
` Three strikes already?`
`I'm cheering for you.`
`Then Satoshi-kun pouted as he mumbled:`
`"Mmph......"`
`I felt tears pouring down my face.`
`......Ooh...`
` ...sniffle`
` sniffle...`
`"Satoshi-kun... Satoshi-kun......`
` Aaah... Oooh......"`
`The happy dream faded out with my sobs.`
`The harder I tried to focus on it, the faster it faded.`
` Soon it was all gone.`
`I could see the bright morning sun through a crack in the curtains.`
`I was in Mion's room at the Sonozaki house.`
`When did I come back?`
`I was crouching in the corner of the room and crying.`
`......A dream is a dream.`
`I wished I hadn't woken up.`
`But one must wake up from a dream.`
` We live in a world where there are no dreams, and that's why we always wake up.`
`But I wasn't sure if I was the only one dreaming that dream.`
`Because I felt like Satoshi-kun was right beside me.`
`"...Satoshi-kun?`
` Did... you... come back...?"`
`There was no reply.`
`That was the rule.`
`If it was Satoshi-kun, I wish it'd smile at me just once.`
`But Satoshi-kun's presence`
` faded away`
` as if he were never there to begin with......`
`I heard the phone ring by the front door.`
`Ah, that's right.`
`I was the only one in the house now.`
` I had to answer it.`
`I got up to walk to the front door.`
`I felt unsteady, so I put my hand on the wall to support myself.`
`I hardly got any sleep.`
`It was like I had a bad cold.`
`The phone continued to ring.`
`...I probably didn't have to answer it, actually.`
`But I was still half-asleep and all I could think of was answering the phone.`
`"......Hello, Sonozaki residence."`
`"Sorry to call you so early. It's Kimiyoshi.`
` Is your grandma still sleeping?"`
`It was Uncle Kimiyoshi.`
`"She is, yes.`
` I guess she's still tired from yesterday.`
` I think I'll let her sleep in."`
`"Yeah, you probably should.`
` Mion-chan, you're going to school, right?`
` Can I leave a message with you?"`
`"Sure.`
` What is it?"`
`"Let's see...`
` There will be an emergency meeting regarding the incident from yesterday. It'll be at the shrine's assembly hall, starting at 5 PM. Did you get that?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'll give her the message."`
`As soon as I put the phone down, it rang again.`
`"Hello, Sonozaki residence."`
`"Good morning. Sorry to call you so early.`
` This is Kasai... Is this Mion-san?`
` Good morning."`
`"Mmm... Kasai-san...`
` Good morning."`
`"Is Shion-san still there?"`
`I wasn't panicked, but I hesitated.`
`I could tell him no.`
` Or I could play both Mion and Shion.`
`"Shion was washing her face just now.`
` I'll get her for you."`
`I decided to play two parts. I went back and forth down the hallway and picked up the phone again.`
`"Kasai?`
` Morning!"`
`"Good morning, Shion-san.`
` Are you going to school today?"`
`"Of course not.`
` I feel miserable."`
`"I kind of expected that.`
` By the way, how are you getting back to Okinomiya?`
` I can have someone come pick you up..."`
`"Mmm, I think I can get a ride from Uncle Kimiyoshi or somebody else.`
` Don't worry, I'll figure something out."`
`"Your father told me to make sure you go to school often enough.`
` I'd appreciate your cooperation."`
`"Hee hee hee, I'll go when I feel like it.`
` ......By the way, Kasai...`
` Did you hear?"`
`"What about?"`
`"You know, the incident from last night."`
`"Yes, I have.`
` How truly horrifying."`
`"All the past victims were war criminals from the dam conflict, right?`
` But it's different this year.`
` What do you think about that?"`
`"Hmm...`
` I don't really know."`
`Kasai wasn't the type to talk too much.`
`If it was about something complicated, he usually responded like that.`
`"Do you know why those two fell under the curse of Oyashiro-sama?"`
`"No."`
`"I heard this last night...`
` Supposedly...... they snuck into the ritual storehouse during the festival.`
` They used a metal wire or something to unlock the door."`
`Kasai went silent for a while.`
`I held my breath while waiting to see how he responded.`
`I expected him to say that he couldn't believe those people were chosen as victims just for sneaking into a storehouse.`
`I expected him to say`
` that it was just too unrealistic.`
`"...I see.`
` That was stupid of them."`
`"Hmm? ...Ahahaha.`
` Since Tomitake-san was an outsider, I bet he didn't know."`
`I went along with Kasai, but I felt disturbed on the inside.`
`Kasai didn't wonder why breaking into the ritual storehouse would justify their deaths.`
`I'd known Kasai for a long time, which is why I knew there was a heavy meaning to what he said.`
`"By the way, Kasai.`
` Actually...`
` ehehe, I did it too."`
`"Did you go in?"`
`"Mm...`
` ...yeah.`
` Ahahaha..."`
`"...You went into the ritual storehouse,`
` Shion-san?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Takano-san invited me.`
` Takano-san, Tomitake-san and... remember Keiichi who just moved here recently? Him and me, to make four of us."`
`I heard Kasai sighing heavily.`
`Even though he didn't say a word, I could tell he was shocked.`
`I'd never known him to act this way before.`
`"Shion-san.`
` Don't you remember what happened last year?`
` How do you think you can take care of this?"`
`"...Mm... ...hmm.`
` Last year, it was three nails... so maybe five this year?"`
`"..............."`
`"Ah... sorry.`
` I wasn't trying to make light of the situation!`
` I knew I shouldn't have done it.`
` I regret it at least a little. But is it really that terrible a thing to do?"`
`"You are related to the Sonozaki main family.`
` Do you really think people would understand?"`
`"But... I've been living in Okinomiya all my life!`
` Since the hag hated me, I've barely been to Hinamizawa!`
` Besides, I was stuck at school.`
` How would I know about any of that?!"`
`I heard another sigh from Kasai.`
`That sigh told me my excuses would be useless.`
`"Shion-san.`
` I am your ally.`
` I want to support you as much as I can.`
` But there are dangers even I can't protect you from.`
` Besides, Shi-"`
`"Ah, ahahaha!`
` Sorry!`
` Sis is here, I've got to go.`
` See ya!"`
`Click!`
`I interrupted Kasai and hung up.`
`I didn't want to hear it.`
`I didn't want to hear Kasai reject me. He, who had been my ally all my life.`
`"Hahahahahaha...`
` Shit...`
` ...damn`
` it..."`
`I could hear the sound of the cicadas.`
` The sound made it feel`
` like I was being cooked on a huge frying pan, making a sizzling noise.`
`I couldn't help feeling remorseful.`
`Now I knew that sneaking into the ritual storehouse wasn't a laughing matter.`
`But I really didn't know it at the time.`
`Sure, the door was locked, so they didn't want anyone to go in.`
`Then why did they change the lock?`
`What did they say?`
`I think it was that Rika-chama said that the previous lock was too heavy for her, so she had it changed to that cheap one.`
`That was how Takano-san broke in.`
`If the heavy lock was still there, this wouldn't have happened!!`
`I slapped my own forehead.`
`......Hahh.`
` Then I took a deep breath.`
`I had to calm down.`
`What was the point of fussing now?`
`I'd already passed the point of no return.`
`There was no use thinking otherwise.`
`The hag was already dead.`
`Even if she wasn't, she was now at the bottom of the well.`
`Therefore, it was already past the point where I could just cut my fingers off in apology.`
`I felt so unstable.`
`I'd walked on the fence around the swings at the park before, as if I was walking on a tightrope.`
`It was fun because even if I fell, it was only a very short distance.`
`But it wouldn't have been fun if I were up really high.`
`At that very moment, I was in fact already on a tightrope that was a lot higher than the fence at the park.`
`As soon as I took a step, the rope behind me would vanish.`
`I couldn't step back, because there was nothing behind me.`
`That was, in short, the current situation I found myself in.`
`Just standing in one spot was all I could do.`
`...Even if I never took another step, I'd fall if I wasn't careful.`
`If I forced myself to walk, the danger would only increase.`
` But if I didn't move, I would fall eventually.`
`I couldn't see what was ahead of me.`
`There was no guarantee that I'd ever find firm ground.`
`But if I stopped... there was only one fate waiting for me.`
`I have to... move onward!`
`If staying here guaranteed death, then I'd rather try to walk, even if I'd die as a result.`
`Even if there was a dead end ahead of me, at least I tried my hardest.`
`In general, I try to be optimistic.`
`I could accept my life not lasting particularly long.`
`But... I wouldn't go easily.`
`I'd struggle as much as possible...`
`I'd already killed the hag.`
` For that, there could be no other punishment than death!`
`I knew my life would end soon.`
`In other words......`
` I was actually...`
` already dead.`
`"......A dead person has nothing to lose.`
` That means... I can only go on the offensive."`
`I clenched my fists tightly as I muttered.`
`Even if I had to die`
` ...I couldn't die easily.`
`This was my chance to avenge Satoshi-kun.`
`Who did it, for what purpose, and why?`
`I was going to investigate.`
`I was going to question.`
`I was going to expose.`
`Yes, I was going to settle the score.`
`I'd carry out the plan I came up with yesterday.`
`I could hide the hag's death somehow.`
`All I'd have to say is that she hadn't been feeling well since Watanagashi.`
`I could do it all while pretending to be Mion.`
`Just in case her friends at school became suspicious, maybe I'd start telling them I hadn't been feeling well either.`
`In fact, I did feel groggy from my lack of sleep.`
`When I became Mion, Shion would automatically disappear.`
`I'd already told Kasai that I snuck into the shrine storage, so he'd probably end up telling people that I was demoned away, due to the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The last person I'd have to think about was the fourth one who snuck into the ritual storehouse, Keiichi Maebara.`
`Maybe I can use him as bait to lure out the enemy.`
`Sorry, Kei-chan, you're going to be my bait.`
`I felt a little bad, since I was starting to like him.`
`With all that figured out, let's go to school.`
`I'd gone to school as Mion before, so I knew how things worked.`
`It was almost time to leave the house.`
`"Mii-chaaaaan!!`
` You're laaaate!!"`
`"Hah!`
` Hah!`
` ...You waited?`
` Y-You should have just gone on ahead..."`
`"Hey, Mion?`
` Your face is red.`
` You're breathing heavily, too."`
`"Mii-chan... Are you not feeling well?"`
`Rena put her hand on my forehead.`
`"...Rena, your hand is pretty cold."`
`"Mii-chan... You're a little bit warm."`
`"It's no big deal.`
` ...Give it half a day and I'll be fit as a fiddle."`
`"Are you really okay?`
` ...You don't have to push yourself, you know."`
`"What's this?`
` Kei-chan, are you worried about me?`
` Ahaha... That's nice of you."`
`I'd always thought he was a goofball, so I was a little surprised.`
`I'd thought they would tease me, but they didn't.`
`"I-I just think you shouldn't push yourself so hard.`
` We can tell the teacher you had to take the day off."`
`"I'm fine, I'm fine!`
` I took some medicine.`
` I think it's already working."`
`"Okay... then let's go.`
` Don't overdo it... but, of course, there's...`
` ...the time."`
`"Wah?!`
` W-We need to run or we won't m-make it~!!"`
`"Ahh ha ha ha!`
` This morning got pretty thrilling.`
` Maybe it's just what I need to shake off this sluggishness!`
` Let's run!"`
`"President, if you would."`
`"Ah......!`
` ...Everybody stand up!!`
` At attention!!"`
`I'd made the same mistake before.`
`I never learn, do I?`
`"Do you think Mii-chan is doing okay?`
` She doesn't look good..."`
`"Oh, really?`
` How unfortunate."`
`It was a good idea to make them believe I was sick.`
`Even if I did things differently from Mion, I had an excuse.`
`"Well, you know.`
` Girls have those days when they just don't feel well..."`
`"...I don't have those days. `
`Nipah☆."`
`Mion's friends kept each other occupied and left me alone.`
`Keiichi Maebara...`
`He might suddenly disappear one day... I couldn't let that happen.`
`That would be like letting a fish take the bait and swim away while I was fast asleep with a fishing pole in my hands.`
`I couldn't miss the moment the enemy took a bite out of Keiichi. I had to be very careful.`
`But it was impossible to keep my eyes on him 24 hours a day.`
`Spying on him at school like this wasn't good enough.`
`Should I have him meet with Shion and let her explain that he's in danger?`
`Maybe we could set up a strategy together.`
`I didn't think Keiichi realized how serious a crime it was to step into the ritual storehouse. I hadn't, after all.`
`Since last year, all the incidents that related to the curse had probably been investigated in secret.`
`People involved with the Three Families would know about the incident from last night,`
` but Keiichi shouldn't know anything.`
`If he knew where he stood now, he'd be more cautious too.`
`That should make him aware of his surroundings... and maybe he would notice if anything odd took place.`
`The teacher caught him sleeping, so she ordered him to go wash his face. He walked out into the hallway.`
`I was sleepy too.`
`I had to be alert, but I couldn't clear my mind due to my lack of sleep.`
`I decided to go home early.`
`Since I'd been pretending to be sick since morning, my request was approved.`
`As I exited the building, I saw Keiichi washing his face.`
`"I thought you'd be out here.`
` It feels better outside, huh?"`
`"Hm... Mion? `
`...Yaaawn.`
` No cutting class now~."`
`It looked like it felt refreshing for him to wash his face with cold water.`
`I washed my face too.`
`But it didn't feel as good as it looked.`
`"...Mion, how is your cold doing?`
` You're sleepy because of the medicine, not from lack of sleep, yeah?"`
`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And, well... I had a bit."`
`Gulp.`
` I pretended to drink with an invisible glass.`
`"A-Are you hung over?!`
` How old are you?!"`
`Keiichi exaggerated his reaction, but he still seemed worried.`
`"Okay, later. I'm going back.`
` Be careful on your way home.`
` Don't wobble into a sewer or a brook, got it?"`
`Keiichi turned around to go back to the classroom.`
`"Oh... One more thing, Kei-chan."`
`I stopped Keiichi.`
` He, in response, turned around.`
`"What's up?"`
`"This may sound weird, but don't think too hard about it."`
`"Well, depends on what it is."`
`"Last night, near the end of the festival.`
` ...Did you see Tomitake-san or Takano-san anywhere?"`
`I noticed Keiichi's body tense up.`
`His reaction proved that he felt guilty about sneaking into the ritual storehouse.`
`He was frightened that Mion Sonozaki might know about it.`
`...I guess this was enough to give him a certain impression of Mion Sonozaki...`
`"You know Tomitake-san and Takano-san, don't you?`
` You remember, Kei-chan, when the four of you were talking during setup the day before?"`
`I could clearly see how dismayed Keiichi felt.`
`He was trying to come up with an excuse.`
`"I can't remember...`
` I might have seen them... or not..."`
`He was both a bad liar and a bad actor.`
`He wasn't really that intelligent at all.`
`Well, that would make him a suitable friend for Mion.`
`He was just a brat, unlike Satoshi-kun.`
`Although, when it came to lying and acting, Satoshi-kun was at about the same level.`
`Maybe Keiichi should be credited for at least trying to tell a lie.`
`Satoshi-kun wouldn't have even said a thing...`
`.........I didn't need to be thinking about him right now...`
`".........I see.`
` Then, one more question.`
` On the same night,`
` did you see Shion?"`
`This was a very mean question.`
` Keiichi was perplexed, as I'd expected.`
`"...That... didn't you ask me that yesterday?`
` ...I think I told you that I wasn't sure if I had or not..."`
`Eh?`
` I'd asked him that yesterday?`
`He must have meant that Mion Sonozaki asked him that question.`
`In other words, she asked him that after he left the storehouse and got back together with his friends.`
`Damn you, Mion...`
`When I asked her, she said she'd had no idea we went into the ritual storehouse...`
`.....................Shit...............`
`"Hm, did you?`
` ...I guess I just thought I'd get a different answer if I asked you again."`
`"Wh-Why are you so intent on knowing if I did or not?"`
`He was getting defensive.`
`Keiichi couldn't hide his panic as he flared up at me.`
`"It's not important.`
` ...It's just that there are some people...`
` ...who are speaking poorly of Tomitake-san, Takano-san, Shion, and you, Kei-chan.`
` ......I didn't really hear what they were saying, though."`
`Keiichi was really perplexed now.`
`This wasn't fun at all`
` but it could still be`
` an interesting game.`
`"I don't believe that you were doing something bad.`
` ...I just wanted to ask a bit about it, so I did.`
` ...Sorry for making you uncomfortable, okay?"`
`I made sure Keiichi felt a sense of crisis, then left.`
`When I returned to the Sonozaki house, I saw a woman with an apron on.`
`It was a housekeeper. Her name was Shimiko-san.`
`The hag had a few housekeepers who took care of the chores around the house.`
`"Ah, Mion-chan, I'm glad you're here..."`
`"Hey, Shimiko-san. Can I help you?"`
`Today was her turn to come help out at the house.`
`She'd arrived, but the gate was locked and she couldn't get in.`
`She'd called, but there was no answer, so she had been just standing there, not knowing what to do.`
`"Something must have happened to Granny at the festival... She's been in an evil mood ever since last night."`
`"Ah.........`
` I see......"`
`Shimiko-san tried to remember if she had done something wrong.`
`"She isn't ignoring you. She's just sleeping.`
` She was up until very late, so I bet she can't wake up yet.`
` You know how she is, right? `
`Once she gets into this mood, it'll take a long time for her to be happy again."`
`"Yes... that's too bad..."`
`"I think it might be better that you don't show up for a while.`
` Even if you don't mean to upset her, Granny might take it the wrong way.`
` Just let me take care of it."`
`"I... I see. Are you sure?`
` I'm very grateful though..."`
`"Sorry to make you do this, but could you let the other housekeepers know that they don't need to come for a while either?`
` When Granny feels better, I'll give you a call.`
` So let's just leave her alone for now..."`
`Shimiko-san bowed, then left on her bicycle...`
`Anyone who had ever experienced Granny's wrath would understand.`
`I headed into Mion's room, set her alarm clock for 2 PM, and crawled into her bed.`
`I needed to recover quickly.`
` I had to be sharp, calm, and cool-headed...`
`School should be out by 2 PM.`
`Maybe I'd get in touch with Keiichi.`
` I'd have to call him.`
`There would also be a staff meeting at the Furude Shrine assembly hall in the evening.`
`All the leaders of the Three Families, their relatives, and the town council members would gather at this meeting.`
`They were all authority figures in Hinamizawa.`
`I'd be attending in place of the hag, who was 'sick.'`
`I'd worry about the rest when I got there.`
`People shouldn't notice that Mion and the hag were missing for a long time.`
`I didn't need to worry, as I had plenty of time...`
`I checked the alarm once more... `
`Then fell asleep as if someone switched me off.`
`"Hello?"`
`"Ah... This is Sonozaki. Well, the younger one.`
` Hello.`
` Do you have time to talk right now?"`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be sleeping in today with a hangover, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` My sis had a hangover?`
` Ah hahahaha!`
` That's so like her~~!"`
`Keiichi had no idea that the Mion he saw earlier was actually me.`
`He didn't notice when we talked in person, so there's no way he would notice on the phone.`
`I never knew that playing two roles would be so much fun.`
`To feel such enjoyment in this game of life or death, maybe I was getting used to this situation.`
`Or maybe my senses had gone numb.`
`"......Whoops... sorry.`
` My parents are waiting for an important call, so I can't talk for too long.`
` ...What do you need?"`
`"...There's something I wanted to talk about... but if we can't talk long, I guess that's that..."`
`"Then how about we meet in person?`
` If you could show me where the library is too, that would be great."`
`"You mean the public library near the station?`
` Yes, that's fine.`
` I go past there on my way to work anyway."`
`We decided to meet in Okinomiya.`
`It wasn't easy to get there from Hinamizawa.`
`But I had to hurry.`
` I couldn't run into Keiichi as he was heading there himself.`
`I recalled that the key to the hag's motorcycle was in her secret drawer.`
`The hag usually got driven around for public events, but when she had her own errands, she rode her motorcycle.`
`Keiichi, I assumed, was going to ride his bicycle. I'd try to get to Okinomiya before he did.`
`Keiichi arrived quite a bit later than me.`
`Motorcycles are faster, after all.`
`There were hardly any traffic lights to worry about on the way here, either.`
