`Satoshi-kun looked terrible.`
`When he went home, he had to mediate a fight between Satoko and their aunt. He became mentally exhausted.`
`He went to work every day. He became physically exhausted.`
`He no longer communicated with his classmates. He either slept on his desk,`
` or was gone somewhere during lunch break.`
`He used to be really gentle. It was painful to see him suffering like that.`
`On top of all that, he was dealing with the curse of Oyashiro-sama. He must have been completely, totally, and absolutely exhausted.`
`That curse was a form of surveillance by those planning to victimize Satoshi-kun that year.`
`That means`
` that the other victim was in the same situation.`
`Satoshi-kun's aunt had also been watched.`
`Did she notice any presence?`
`What about the others?`
`Did the victims of the previous incidents also experience it?`
`I need to investigate the facts in order to prove the curse on Satoshi-kun was actually just surveillance.`
`Is it surveillance,`
` paranoia...`
` or really the curse`
`...?`
