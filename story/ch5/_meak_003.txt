`"Mm.`
` I don't think the bit about the illness is true,`
` but his death was very sudden.`
`The priest was busy preparing for the festival and he'd gotten sick around that time,`
` so I guess he died of a heart attack or something."`
`"But it's just crazy that somebody died on the day of Watanagashi again.`
` It's the third time in a row.`
` It's unbelievable that so many people have died on the exact same day."`
`"The coroner didn't find anything unusual about the cause of death, so nobody suspected that anything was wrong...`
` But you're right that the whole situation is abnormal."`
`"Only the people who were likely to be cursed died on the day of the festival.`
` There must be something behind this.`
` Whether it's a conspiracy or a curse, there has to be."`
`I decided to meet up with Mion at the library near the Okinomiya train station.`
`...It's not that I don't trust Mion, but I don't want to let her know where I live.`
`Not many people use this library, so I won't see anyone from Hinamizawa here.`
`It's very convenient for meeting someone in secret.`
`After we discussed my life plan and work schedule, we moved to small talk.`
`I've been away from this town for years.`
`Things have changed.`
`...I asked Mion about those changes in detail, in order to fill in the gaps.`
`While talking about various things, I brought up what Uncle Yoshiroh had told me...`
`About Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`Even before I left town...`
`The curse had already struck twice.`
`The dismemberment murder on the first year left quite an impact.`
`And the year after--`
`The pro-dam activist couple fell off the cliff`
` on the day the villagers were enjoying their first Watanagashi festival since the dam project was indefinitely frozen.`
`This one also left quite the impact.`
`The evil construction site manager was punished, and the next year, the traitor to the village met the same fate.`
`...If it had happened only once, people would have concluded that it was just a bizarre coincidence.`
`But when it happened two years in a row...`
` people were far more likely to believe it was a curse.`
`I know up to that part.`
`And after I left town...`
` the curse struck again for the third time.`
`People talked about the curse more intensely than ever, both in Hinamizawa and Okinomiya.`
`...I have to rethink this.`
`Oyashiro-sama's curse has drastically gained credibility while I was away.`
`It was still unclear with the first two incidents...`
`But after it continued for three years straight... people's doubts changed to convictions.`
`Even though the priest who died on the third year wasn't an enemy of the villagers,`
` the fact that people in Hinamizawa didn't care for him much... added even more credibility to the idea.`
`"Wasn't the priest... hated by a few?`
` Especially by the committee members?"`
`"Yeah.`
` They criticized him for being a fence-sitter.`
` Toward the end of the dam conflict, the protesters were all taking aggressive stances,`
` so they didn't like how soft he was being."`
`The priest had looked strict and scary. The way he spoke was always so formal.`
`But in reality, he was very warm and reserved.`
`Maybe it was because he was a son-in-law, having married into his family.`
`I'm sure the priest and his personality were the perfect fit for managing the shrine that was used for summer festivals and village meetings.`
`But that gathering-spot-style atmosphere of the shrine...`
` changed completely when the dam war broke out and it became the headquarters for the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
`Prior to the dam protests, hardly anyone worshiped Oyashiro-sama.`
`Of course the devout elders paid worship to him, but the average person treated our god like how you'd treat fortune telling.`
`Once the dam protests began, Oyashiro-sama was suddenly hauled out as the symbol of the village's resistance.`
`Tracing the Oyashiro-sama faith back to its roots, `
`it was an exclusive, elitist faith... that believed its members were descended from a holy ancestor, different from the masses at the foot of the mountain, and that those tainted masses should never come near the village.`
`Of course, such self-centered ideology wasn't acceptable anymore in peaceful postwar Japan.`
`So this doctrine was abandoned over time.`
`Still, that idea remained, and they trudged it back up to fan the flames of nationalism and unite the town against the dam project.`
`With the revival of those ideas, things only grew more radical by the day.`
`...And it didn't take very long for the Onigafuchi Guardians to become aggressive.`
`After that, we were in a state of war.`
`"100 million, burning as one!" "Kill the white savages!" "Want naught but victory!"`
`Adults and kids both were gnawing at the bit, avid to repel the foreign invaders.`
`...Describing it like that makes it sound kind of awful, like a reminder of the dark times of wartime Japan,`
` but like I said before, for us kids it felt less like a war and more like a village-wide festival.`
`......Yet despite calling it a festival, dissenters were treated coldly.`
`...Their heartlessness lived up to the expression "wartime regime."`
`The Houjou couple who voiced their acceptance of their dam project in the midst of that atmosphere... were truly brave.`
`Then on the second year of the curse they died in an accident,`
` and everyone believed it was Oyashiro-sama's curse without question...`
`So they were branded "traitors" and "enemies of the village"...`
`The Houjou couple faced worse than just being ostracized as traitors.`
`Everyone gave them the cold shoulder and talked behind their backs.`
`The only person who didn't treat them badly was...`
` the priest.`
`While the priest never objected to the anti-dam movement,`
` he also never objected to the Houjou couple's advocacy for accepting the government's eviction and restitution to rebuild new lives.`
`"Those unforgiveable Houjous!" became a slogan as the Three Families (especially the Sonozakis) united the village by turning them into scapegoats... `
`So they must have found it very shameful to have a fellow member of the Three Families approve of that, especially when it was the priest of the shrine that had become a symbol for the dam protests.`
`As central figures in Hinamizawa, the Three Families were the backbones of the Onigafuchi Guardians, so a difference of opinion was undesirable,`
` and the priest was never accused of anything.`
`...But secretly, people whispered that he was a heretic, that he was unfit to serve as Oyashiro-sama's priest,`
` that Oyashiro-sama's curse would soon strike him down... along with other rumors...`
`"Don't you think the priest was more mature than those around him?"`
`He was pretty cool, managing to keep his head and remain neutral while everyone around him grew fervent.`
`I thought Mion would share my opinion when I chimed back in.`
`...So when Mion gave me a forced smile... and didn't agree with me...`
` ...I was taken by surprise.`
`"...Hmm...`
` If he were really mature, I think he would have cooperated with the others. He should have appeased them.`
` He wasn't just the head priest, he was also the head of the Furude family...`
`That was a time when all of Hinamizawa needed to be united, so having one of the families, who are supposed to serve as examples, disturb that harmony was...`
`I don't know if that should be called mature. `
`...It's hard for me to tell."`
`I was taken aback.`
`I barely managed to say the following.`
`"...............`
`Uh-huh."`
`Even though we're identical twins, we still had our own unique identities.`
`Every now and then our opinions differed.`
`But usually only over some trivial matter.`
`We've never had a difference of opinion this big.`
`It wasn't an enjoyable feeling. I decided to probe her some more.`
`"I don't really like that word you used, 'appease.'`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Are you saying the priest should have thought of the village as a whole and kept his opinions a secret? `
`Meaning people shouldn't assert the self before the whole?"`
`"...I-I'm not going that far...`
` It's just... I thought that, as a member of the Three Families, he should have acted more carefully... That's what I mean..."`
`Mion faltered a bit as my tone grew more like a cross-examination.`
`I realized I was speaking a bit too harshly.`
`...What Mion expressed was probably the more "mature" opinion on our scale.`
`When everyone needs to work together to stand up to a vast enemy like the government, people should refrain from actions that would destabilize that alliance.`
`...Writing it out and reading it now, I can understand that.`
`But I wasn't mature enough to agree to such a totalitarian idea.`
`Or maybe it wasn't me at all.`
`...It was Mion who'd made that mature judgment.`
`...We've been separated for over a year.`
`I've been away from the town.`
`...In the meantime, Mion has been training to take over the headship of the Sonozaki family.`
`She'd been treated as such even before I was confined to that institution.`
`She sat next to the hag in ceremonies and in meetings. She took her place when the hag was absent.`
`But that was just it.`
`We were never that different.`
`Mion has become very like a successor since I've been gone.`
`"...Uh-huh.`
` You sound like a grownup now."`
`She seemed to get what I was implying.`
`"...Am I thinking like Granny now...?"`
`"That's good.`
` You're the successor.`
` You shouldn't think like the rest.`
` You've definitely learned the art of ruling."`
`"I never learned anything like that.`
` I'm just trying to act like her...`
`You can do it easily, too."`
`"Aha ha ha ha. I don't want to.`
` It's your role.`
` Well, don't try too hard or you'll tire yourself out."`
`I didn't mean to be cold, but Mion seemed to take it that way.`
`She smiled as if trying to pacify me.`
`I smiled gently back at her.`
`"Sis......`
` I mean, Mion."`
`"...What? ...What is it?"`
`"Our separation has always been tough.`
` Our names, the places where we live, and... our bodies."`
`Mion looked down with a serious face...`
` but then looked right back up.`
`"...Maybe you think I'm jealous of that,`
` but I'm not.`
` We used to have some disagreements,`
` but they were always small and forgettable.`
` You don't have to feel sorry for anything."`
`Up until birth, we were perfectly equal.`
`Right after birth, we were separated by the grownups' priorities.`
`...I used to get mad about it when I was little.`
` There's no denying that.`
`But we don't have to start a disagreement over it.`
`Mion seems to understand what I'm trying to say.`
`...We each have our own characteristics, even though we're identical twins.`
`Only we know the differences.`
`...We're also dependent on each other because of them.`
`Mion seems more dependent.`
`...She always worries about me.`
`If somebody gave her a cookie, she'd divide it in two and give one half to me.`
`If somebody gave her a candy, she'd wait until I said it was okay to eat it.`
`On the contrary, I'm cold.`
`I don't care about others if I'm satisfied.`
`I'd put the candy in my mouth right away.`
`(I have to emphasize that I don't hate her,`
` and I'm well aware that she loves me.)`
`......We both know that.`
`Mion must have been hesitating to put the candy of the successor in her mouth and was waiting to see if I was okay with that.`
`"Do your best, Mion...`
` I'll do my best as Shion, too."`
`I tapped her forehead with my fist lightly.`
`...Mion put her forehead against my fist as if trying to feel the warmth.`
`She's Mion.`
`And I'm Shion.`
`She's the successor of the Sonozaki family, and I'm just a vagabond.`
`That isn't a distinction, but rather, our individuality.`
`We shouldn't worry too much about the other anymore.`
` We should feel relaxed, living as who we are, with our own characteristics.`
`I didn't have to say any of that out loud.`
` We can communicate by touch, just like this.`
`"...Okay...`
` Thanks,`
` Shion."`
`"No worries, Mion.`
` Let's talk to each other whenever we want to,`
` like we've always been.`
` That'll never change, okay?"`
`"......Okay.`
` ......Okay."`
`Mion kept nodding, with her forehead against my fist...`
`I said goodbye to Mion before it turned to evening.`
`We had talked about the things that happened during my time away, and I enjoyed having that chat between sisters very much.`
`...We were able to dissolve our unsettled emotions.`
`We didn't use to do that.`
`Maybe it's because we hadn't seen each other for over a year.`
`"......Whew."`
`It was late afternoon.`
`......My heart felt lighter now. I stretched and looked up at the sky.`
`The sky was clear, blue, and far away.`
`No matter how tall I grow,`
` I'll never be able to touch that sky.`
`I'm Shion Sonozaki.`
`...A girl who escaped from the life she was forced to live.`
`Nobody will praise me for what I did and for what I'm going to do.`
`...But this is what I chose.`
`"Aha!`
` ...I can think maturely, too!"`
`I psyched myself up.`
`I should go shopping for dinner.`
`Though I have Kasai's help, I need to save money.`
`I love junk food, but it'd be cheaper to cook.`
`...Ironically, the culinary classes from that evil school will come in handy.`
`Why not go to the shopping district in Kami-isshiki?`
`...Hm?`
` If I'm going there,`
` then I'd need to take the other street.`
`The cool breeze in the late afternoon felt nice on my skin.`
`Kasai came to the door while I was putting stuff I bought into the fridge.`
`"Ah, wait a sec.`
` I'm coming."`
`"...Did you go grocery shopping?`
` You must be tired."`
`"I don't get tired from grocery shopping. Ahahaha.`
` Oh, do you want dinner?`
` I bought enough for you, too."`
`"Is that alright?`
` ...If you say so, I'd be happy to."`
`Kasai looked curious about what I'd cook.`
`"Humph.`
` You don't look like you believe in my cooking skills.`
` You'll pay for that later!"`
`"Are you putting these in the refrigerator?`
` I'll do it."`
`"Oh, thanks...`
` Is this amount of rice enough for two?`
` Here I go."`
`Kasai skillfully packed food in the fridge while glancing at each item in turn.`
`He noticed something.`
`"...Shion-san,`
` do you still hate canned food?"`
`I hadn't bought any.`
` That was, of course, on purpose.`
`"It must be hard to avoid it."`
`"Hmmm...`
` I know it's illogical...`
` Maybe I could eat it if somebody forced me to...`
` No, on second thought, I definitely couldn't..."`
`"I feel really sorry.`
` I know I was out of line then.`
` Please forget about that story."`
`"Ahh, shut up!`
` Men shouldn't hang around in the kitchen!`
` Go watch TV or something."`
`Kasai chuckled and left.`
`I know this sounds stupid...`
` but I hate canned food.`
`If somebody told me there was canned food in a meal I just ate, I'd throw up.`
`It started with a silly thing.`
`......Kasai told me a horror story when I was little.`
`...You know, one of those urban legends.`
`About meat made from an unknown source.`
`Like those rumors about how there's worm meat mixed into burger patties, or dog meat in beef bowls.`
`Kasai had fun telling me one of those stories because of how scared I got.`
`He had fun, but I obviously didn't.`
`I even started to cry in the canned food section of a supermarket. That's how much I hated it.`
`I don't freak out like that anymore,`
` but I still don't like canned food.`
`...Since I don't like it, I don't force myself and I now live my life naturally avoiding canned food.`
`One of the big differences between us twins...`
`Is that Mion doesn't have this issue.`
`Kasai feels responsible for this, but he can't rid me of that fear.`
`Still, a flaw like this is actually a good thing, otherwise I'd be too perfect!`
` Ahahahahaha.`
`"Kasai, set the table, would you?"`
`"It smells good.`
` Thank you for doing this."`
`"If this isn't enough food, you can go to a beef bowl place later or something.`
` And don't turn off the TV.`
` I hate having dinner in silence."`
`"Thank you for the meal."`
`"So,`
` what is it, Kasai?`
` You came here for something, didn't you?"`
`I handed him a cup of tea.`
`I could wait until dinner was over, but I wanted to get to the point quick.`
`"I thought I should wait until we finished, but...`
` would you mind if I talked while eating?"`
`"It's been bugging me since you got here.`
` It'd be much easier for me to eat if you started talking now."`
`"We received a phone call from the school today."`
`"Today?`
` Aha ha, that's late.`
` Sounds like they didn't want to make it public.`
` Aha haha...`
` So, what happened?"`
`"Akane-san took the call.`
` She said she was going to tell your father when the time is right."`
`Akane-san is my mom.`
` That's what Kasai calls her, as he's known her since before her marriage.`
`"So?`
` What did she say?"`
`I was lucky she answered the phone.`
`Since she's relatively on my side.`
`"Other than calling you a brat...`
` She didn't seem surprised by this outcome."`
`"...I see.`
` So she hasn't told Dad yet?"`
`"She's probably waiting for the right moment.`
` I think she's going to in a couple of days."`
`"......Humm, dad is on the hag's side,`
` so he'll definitely talk to her if he hears about it.`
` Then she'll have her men bring me to her`
` and depending on my explanation, make me offer a finger or two...`
` Scary! `
`Aha ha ha!"`
`"I wish you could laugh it off,`
` but... please remember you're not the only one who...`
` Ouch..."`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
` You're eating too fast!`
` Uh, I cooked too much rice and miso soup, so you'll have to have another round.`
` At least three helpings, all right?!"`
`A few days later, Mion told me that the hag had heard about my escape.`
`"So?`
` How did she take it?"`
`"She was furious.`
` She said that if you were in Okinomiya, she'd get you right away."`
`"Scary.`
` And?`
` Is Dad doing anything?"`
`"They'll hold a family council soon to see if any of the family members are hiding you.`
` It doesn't look like she'll have the greenhorns search for you all over town, though."`
`Holding a family council means that things will remain in the hag's hands alone.`
`She won't search the town for me. It's like she's unofficially approving my presence.`
`Of course, I'll get caught immediately if they find me in a large public place.`
`"......Seems like Mom did a lot to help me."`
`I can tell she's being supportive.`
`...It's a long story, but my mom is sort of an outlaw, even though she's of the Sonozaki bloodline.`
`A long time ago, she had a huge fight with the hag because she hated the family rules and traditions.`
` She was even excommunicated.`
`...My mom was supposed to be the successor, but she was deprived of the title and Sis took her place instead.`
`While she's quiet now, Mom's still an outlaw.`
`...She's always been on my side, because I also hate rules and traditions.`
`"Dad was flaring up at first,`
` but Mom pacified him...`
` He can't win against her, after all."`
`"Okay, thanks.`
` Let me know if something comes up...`
` If things really go bad, I'm ready to leave town.`
` I can't let Kasai, Uncle Yoshiroh... or Mom lose face."`
`"....................."`
`"...Sis, I know what you're thinking.`
` You're asking yourself why only I have to go through this, even though we're twins, aren't you?"`
`Mion was silent. That meant yes.`
`"It isn't fair that only you have to live like this...`
` It's absolutely not."`
`"...Thanks.`
` I appreciate your feelings."`
`"...Tell me when you want to go out.`
` I'll arrange my plans so that I can trade places with you..."`
`She sounded apologetic.`
`...I shouldn't go quiet, or agree with her.`
`She sticks to things a little too much.`
` Once she goes down, she'll stay there for a while.`
`So, I just told her simply.`
`"Thanks...`
` That's really nice of you.`
` Okay, I'm hanging up now."`
`"Talk to you later."`
