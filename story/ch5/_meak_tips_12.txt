`During the upheaval surrounding Oyashiro-sama's curse in 1982, I was pulled this way and that by new leads on Satoshi-kun's disappearance. Every time I found information that looked promising, I kept changing my theories.`
`But that also became an incredible burden on me.`
` ...It wore me down plenty on its own.`
`The fatigue was harsh, but it also provided a very kind acceptance.`
`Bit by bit it soothed away the anger, sadness, and doubt that wore me down.`
`"I'll never forget Satoshi-kun."`
`"I'll never try to forget him and move on."`
`I constantly repeated those to myself in my head.`
`I repeated them... to keep my memories of Satoshi-kun from fading too.`
` Over,`
` and over.`
`For the sake of my fun memories of Satoshi-kun...`
` ...together with my fear,`
` and my sadness,`
` I repeated them forever and ever.`
