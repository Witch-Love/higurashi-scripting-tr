`I didn't hear a wake-up chime.`
`I'm not in school anymore.`
`My brain is half-asleep, but I'm aware of that.`
`Waking up at the same time as the chime would go off at school... doesn't feel good.`
`I can't go back to sleep after this.`
`Still, I'm not going to live a torturous school life anymore.`
`I can make today either happy or boring. It's up to me.`
`Yay! That's really positive.`
` I feel like I'm alive for the first time in a while.`
`I didn't have any other clothes, so I was still wearing the school track uniform.`
`...It's supposed to have been designed by some famous Italian person, but... it just looks plain to me.`
`It really doesn't feel great to still be in clothes from that school. I want to enjoy my freedom as soon as possible.`
`I especially don't want to walk around outside wearing it.`
`I should have Kasai bring me some new clothes later.`
`And I should think of redecorating this room.`
`After all, this is going to be my castle from now on.`
`This is a room in a gorgeous apartment building in the suburbs of Okinomiya.`
` The property is one a realtor in my dad's conglomerate obtained after foreclosure due to some sort of dispute.`
`...Most of the residents moved out during that.`
`So while there are plenty of rooms, it's a lonely complex that feels devoid of people.`
`Plus, with the exception of the manager and a scant one or two others, all the residents are shady-looking people connected to my dad.`
`It probably won't be much longer before the virtuous residents are driven out...`
`The apartment I'm living in used to be the room they'd use for viewings, so it looks like a room in a business hotel.`
`It's fully furnished, but lacking in daily necessities.`
`I'll buy those things over time, though.`
`"...It's better that way, anyway.`
` It'll make it feel more like my own room."`
`I nodded to myself.`
`It might have looked stupid, but it helped psych me up.`
`At the school, there was a TV only in the common room, and we weren't allowed to watch any cable channels.`
`I zapped through all those channels as a form of emancipation.`
`It was early in the morning, so nothing interesting was on...`
`But I enjoyed it anyway. Commercials are fun to watch.`
`Kasai dropped by with lunch right when I started to feel hungry.`
`"Good morning, Shion-san.`
` Did you sleep well last night?"`
`"Sleeping on the couch was a bit too uncomfortable.`
` As a Japanese person, I want to sleep in a futon on the floor.`
` Ah, this pickled radish is good!"`
`"That's good to hear.`
` Please let me know what you need later on.`
` I'll try to get as much as I can."`
`"Thanks.`
` Oh, but you don't need to worry so much about me.`
` I chose this life for myself, anyway.`
` And your wallet wouldn't last if I started extorting you, right? Ahahahahaha!"`
`I have to be serious about my plan,`
`I can't let myself take advantage of Kasai's wallet forever.`
`"I think I'm going to start a part-time job.`
` I have to earn my own living.`
` This is the life I chose, so naturally I have to take care of it myself!"`
`"That's reassuring to hear.`
` But are you sure?`
` If you go outside, eventually someone in the family will discover you."`
`"I gave that a little thought.`
` Which is why I'll need Mion's help.`
` Kasai, would you mind calling the main house for me?`
` When Mion answers, pass me the receiver."`
`"Oh well, whatever you say.`
` What could be your plan?"`
`Kasai dialed the number.`
`It's funny to me that we're calling the main house, even though that's the place I most want to avoid at the moment.`
`"...Hello."`
`"Good morning.`
` ......Is this Mion-san?`
` ......It's been a while. This is Kasai.`
` ...Yes.`
` Good morning.`
` ...Could you hold for a moment?`
` I'm letting someone else on the phone."`
`I take the handset.`
`"Hello?`
` ......Heh heh heh heh!`
` Can you tell who this is?"`
`"Th-`
`That voice!!`
` But that can't be true...!`
` Shion's still supposed to be confined to St. Lucia's...!`
` You can't be her...!"`
`"Yeah, they forbid outside calls at the academy.`
` But you're talking to me right now... heh heh heh!`
` Even my dim-witted older sister should understand what that means.`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"...Did you...`
` sneak out`
` of the school?!`
` ...Ho...`
` How...?!"`
`"That's not important...`
` I really missed you,`
` Sis..."`
`"......Ghh...`
` Shion...!!!"`
`"........."`
`That was as far as I could take it, and Mion had hit her limit too.`
`"Pff...`
` ...Heh heh heh...`
` ...Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`We both burst into laughter, unable to keep up our act.`
`...It's been a while since we laughed out loud with each other like this.`
`"It's been forever, Shion!!`
` Seriously, what's happened with you?!"`
`"There's not much else to it.`
` I haven't lied or anything."`
`"Wait... then you really ran away?!`
` ...Oooh... great job..."`
`"The security wasn't tight enough to keep me locked up in there!`
` Ahaha!"`
`"...Maybe the school should be grateful you escaped quietly...`
` If you were serious, it'd be easy for you to blow up the whole building to make your escape."`
`"Well, I couldn't have done that, but I might have set it on fire.`
` Ahahahahaha!"`
`Kasai smiled at us in amazement, his face a blend of amusement and exasperation.`
`"Is it okay to talk to you now?"`
`"It's all right.`
` Granny is out for a lesson.`
` She's coming home later in the evening."`
`"That's good.`
` We should get together and talk soon.`
` Just over the phone for today though."`
`"Okay."`
`"Did anybody report my escape to our grandmother?"`
`"Nope.`
` We've heard nothing.`
` I pass along all the calls and guests for the main family now, so no news reaches Granny without going through me.`
` I'm sure she doesn't know."`
`"......Wow,`
` that's awesome.`
` You really sound like the next leader of the Sonozaki family."`
`"You know I don't like that. You should have taken my place."`
`"You're the one with the demon, aren't you?`
` Well, keep giving it your all.`
` I'll be rooting for you from the shadows.`
` Anyway, that's not important now. Ahaha!"`
`"You sound so indifferent...`
` Well, that's okay, I guess..."`
`"If you hear anything about me, give Kasai a call, okay?`
` I'd like to give you my number here, but... I'll keep it secret for the time being.`
` Sorry."`
`"All right...`
` If Granny hears you fled the school... there'll be all kinds of trouble.`
` I'll be on the lookout for now,`
` and I'll let Kasai-san know if something happens."`
`"Thanks.`
` I also have a favor to ask."`
`"I figured you would.`
` Oh, money's out of the question, okay?!"`
`"I never thought I could pester you for money.`
` I just want to ask you for a little help with my part-time job."`
`"I see.`
` ...So that's it, then.`
` What exactly do you need?"`
`We can communicate fast in a situation like this.`
`We don't have to get into details because we know what's on each other's minds.`
`"Uncle Yoshiroh's on my side, isn't he?`
` I'm going to try and see if I can't get a part-time job at one of the businesses he owns.`
` Then I'll call you when I know my shift."`
`"So I just have to disappear while you're working, right?`
` ...That's a little taxing..."`
`"What are you saying, Sis?`
` Are you turning down your only sister's request?`
` Seriously?"`
`"All right, all right. I'll do it!`
` I wouldn't want to see how you'd retaliate if I turned you down."`
`"Ahaha!`
` Thanks!`
` I'll buy you a cake from Schlanke Bertha's!`
` I'll throw in tons of pretty tarts too!"`
`"...Uh, Shion...`
` Schlanke Bertha closed last fall."`
`"Huh?`
` ......Uh, is that so?"`
`"Yeah...`
` The owner had a stroke.`
` He reopened the store once`
` but he got sick again...`
` So he had to shut it down."`
`"......I see...`
` that's a shame...`
` I won't be able to eat their Mont Blanc cakes to my heart's content anymore."`
`I was disappointed that my favorite cake shop had closed down,`
` but more so that this town had changed without my knowing while I was gone.`
`It was... kind of regrettable.`
`"......Are there any other changes I don't know about?"`
`"Yeah,`
` there are some.`
` I'll tell you when we meet up next time."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll tell you about my school life.`
` Let's set a date.`
` I'll call you."`
`"All right.`
` I'll see you then."`
`"...Mion?"`
`"What is it?"`
`"How are you?"`
`"Aha ha ha. I'm fine!"`
`"I'm glad to hear that.`
` I'm hanging up now."`
`"Okay.`
` See you."`
`It's really been a while since I last talked to her.`
`I put down the phone and heaved a sigh as Kasai brought in some tea.`
`"So, how did it go?"`
`"Do you remember Uncle Yoshiroh, who was in favor of me staying?`
` I'll talk to him about my escape`
` and ask him if he can hire me to work at one of his stores."`
`"Are you sure?`
` Some other relative might find out."`
`"That's why I asked Sis a favor.`
` I'll contact her when my shift is set,`
` and she'll disappear while I'm working.`
` Do you get the picture?"`
`Kasai looked puzzled.`
`It's not really that difficult to grasp.`
`"It's simple.`
` If somebody finds me at work, I'll tell them that I'm Mion.`
` Do you get it now?"`
`Normal people wouldn't buy this kind of plan.`
`But Kasai knows too well how easy it is for my sis and me to trade places.`
`"That's audacious... or shrewd, I should say......`
` I'm impressed."`
`"Is that a compliment, Kasai?`
` Hee hee hee...!"`
`Kasai looked amazed.`
`If things go south, it'll affect him too.`
`...Considering the rules of my dad's profession, he won't be able to get away with just a mere apology.`
`That's why he doesn't want me to do anything too risky.`
`...I think I have to make it up to him, since he helped me escape even knowing that risk.`
`"All right. No problem.`
` If I find somebody talking bad about you, I'll beat them up."`
`"Ahaha!`
` Thank you so much!`
` I knew I could rely on you, Uncle Yoshiroh!"`
`Uncle Yoshiroh pounded his chest with his fist after offering me his assurance.`
`He seemed glad that I turned to him first.`
`"I'd be happy to help`
` since I'm so impressed that you're trying to support yourself.`
` If you were here for money, I'd turn you in to your grandmother right away!"`
`"What?`
` You're scaring me, Uncle!`
` Ahahahahahaha!"`
`I knew he was reliable.`
`He understood my situation straight away and promised to help.`
`"Manager, here's the shift chart.`
` I'll put it here."`
`One of the store clerks brought out a work schedule.`
`...There are many things I'm unfamiliar with written on it.`
`"...So, how much can you work?"`
`"That depends on our respective schedules.`
` I hope I can get in when I want to."`
`"Hey, that sounds a little irresponsible...`
` But... I know you're in a difficult situation..."`
`I'm depending on Mion for my work.`
`Our schedules have to match.`
`...Of course, Uncle Yoshiroh understood that.`
`But I also knew he couldn't afford a selfish part-timer who only works when she wants to.`
`In the end, he decided to hire me as an office helper, not an official worker.`
`As a temp, I wouldn't have a work schedule.`
`My uncle also decided to pay me out of his own pocket.`
`"Ahaha.`
` It's fine as long as I can make enough to support myself."`
`"Sure, sure.`
` I expect to get what I'm paying for, okay?`
` And don't call me 'Uncle' in the office, either."`
`"All right, manager!`
` Thanks for hiring me!"`
`"Good, you get it!`
` Ha ha ha ha ha!"`
`Once all the business talk was over, my uncle hounded me with all kinds of questions.`
`He asked me things like,`
` "What was it like in a prestigious girls' boarding school?!"`
`And so on.`
`Apparently there were all kinds of rumors going around about the St. Lucia Academy I was confined to, and everyone was curious about it. `
`I added a few embellishments of my own as I explained how unordinary life at that school was.`
`My uncle looked extremely delighted to hear all the little details about life in a secret garden for girls...`
` Horny bastard.`
`Once my uncle was satisfied, it was my turn to ask all kinds of questions.`
`I wanted to know if anything peculiar had happened while I was gone.`
`I won't be able to act like Mion unless I can fill in the gap of information left in the past two years.`
`"There haven't been many big changes.`
` It's been quiet since the end of the dam conflict."`
`"I went to the academy only a bit after they froze the project.`
` There was still a bit of tension then."`
`"Even after they shut down construction, things were still tense because the project wasn't entirely canceled,`
` but the Onigafuchi Guardians disbanded about a year later.`
` There was a big ceremony held at the shrine. `
`That's when the dam conflict officially ended."`
`"That's right after I was imprisoned...`
` Is everybody slacking now that the conflict is over?"`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` I guess you all had fun playing at war back then during the dam protests, didn't you? `
`Try to imagine how much suffering the adults went through every time they had to come pick up their kids from the police station."`
`"Ahahaha!`
` Well, I can't deny that.`
` It was like a festival for us!"`
`Uncle Yoshiroh seemed exasperated at how differently kids and adults treated the conflict.`
`"Oh yeah, there was that dismemberment murder, wasn't there?`
` The one where that fucking jerk of a construction manager got split into pieces.`
` They still haven't caught the culprit behind that, have they? `
`Did they finally catch him?"`
`"Ah... come to think of it...`
` I don't think they've caught him yet, no."`
`"It happened on the night of Watanagashi, didn't it?`
` I remember everyone making a fuss about it being Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ...That was pretty scary for us kids."`
`"Yeah, yeah, Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` That happened the year after, too."`
`"That's right!`
` That was scary too, wasn't it?!`
` Who was it again? That guy who supported the dam died in an accident, right?`
` Houjou, wasn't it?`
` And it happened on the day of Watanagashi once again. `
`Everyone went crazy! Saying it had to be a curse!`
` That was horrifying.`
` Definitely."`
`The construction manager that everyone hated was killed and dismembered on the night of the Watanagashi festival.`
` That incident, on its own, was more than intense enough for us kids.`
`Worse, part of his body was never found... which made it almost a ghost story amongst us.`
`We seriously believed that the severed right arm was roaming in search of the body it belonged to.`
`It didn't take long for the rumor of Oyashiro-sama's curse to become a topic of discussion among occult researchers and the like,`
` considering the circumstantial factors.`
`Even so, the rumor faded away after about a year.`
`...After the dam project was officially frozen, we held Watanagashi purely as a festival.`
`But the curse struck again.`
`The victim was a pro-dam activist who lived in Hinamizawa, by the name of Houjou. He and his wife were on a trip when they fell from a cliff to their deaths. It was considered an accident.`
`(Technically, police were still searching for the wife's body.`
` If I remember right, they never did find it, did they?)`
`Once again, the man most worthy of Oyashiro-sama's curse fell victim on the night of the Watanagashi festival.`
`So the fuss over Oyashiro-sama's curse rose up again.`
`Until then, Oyashiro-sama wasn't considered very important.`
`At least in the world of us kids, it was just the name of the object of worship in the shrine. Nothing more than that.`
`I'd seen boys peeing on the archway, and I once stuck my hand into the offertory box.`
`The existence of a god didn't matter much to us.`
`But after two consecutive occurrences, the kids no longer doubted the existence of a curse.`
`We were all shaking in fear of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Everybody suddenly became interested in the old stories about him, too.`
`We quietly listened to the musty old stories the elders had to tell,`
` and we started genuinely believing in the tales of Oyashiro-sama's miracles, which any of us would've laughed away before.`
`Oyashiro-sama's rules were awfully simple and clear.`
`Enemies treading into Hinamizawa will be cursed.`
`Villagers leaving the village will be cursed.`
`What defined the "village" was terribly vague. Were we never allowed to leave Hinamizawa Village? Was going to Okinomiya still safe?`
`Was a single step enough to be out? Was a 3-day, 2-night hot spring trip still safe? We kids tried to draw a line.`
`It was decided in the end that if you had a house in Hinamizawa or Okinomiya, you were safe,`
` and it was okay to go on trips if you had a house in either area.`
`(I know it's weird,`
` but those rules were made up by kids, after all.)`
`According to those rules, I'd be cursed, since I lived at a boarding school in such a remote area.`
`I couldn't say it out loud because I felt embarrassed...`
`But in fact, I was a little scared of the curse.`
`"Yeah, it happened again the year after."`
`"It sure is scary when it happens two years in a row.`
` I still believe in Oyashiro-sama's power."`
`"Shion-chan, what are you saying?`
` Don't you know?"`
`"Know?`
` About what?"`
`"...Oh, right.`
` You went to that school before it happened...`
` That's why you don't know."`
`Uncle Yoshiroh grimaced as if he said too much.`
`...As though he'd mentioned something`
` I shouldn't know about...`
`"What is it?`
` You can't leave me hanging like that."`
`"...Well... I think you're mature enough now."`
`"Hey, if you think my body looks underdeveloped,`
` you should see an eye doctor.`
` Either that, or you're a pedo."`
`"......Ah, humph, okay,`
` I'll talk.`
` It happened again the year after that."`
`"What happened?`
` ...What are you talking about?"`
`Tick.`
`When I was very little...`
`......I always had this tick before I heard something bad.`
`It was like a gnome who lived inside me was giving me a warning.`
`...Like he was poking me with a small needle.`
`When I felt this tick before my parents called me, they'd always either chide me or tell me something bad.`
`...So I used to run away when I felt it.`
`But my senses seem to have grown dull over the years.`
`Even though my gnome poked at me...`
` I just sat there.`
`"Hmm...`
` The year after the death of the Houjous...`
` It happened again...`
` Last year, in other words."`
`"Did it...`
` happen on the day of Watanagashi?!`
` Again?!`
` Three years in a row?!"`
`"That's right.`
` You know there's a shrine in Hinamizawa?`
` The Furude Shrine?`
` ...The priest suddenly died on the night of the festival.`
` They said that the cause of death was an unknown illness. `
`And the same night, his wife threw herself into the swamp...`
` There was a big uproar!`
` The mayor even had to hold an emergency meeting......"`
