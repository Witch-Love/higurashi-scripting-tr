`The rainy season was just around the corner, and the air had become so humid that my shirt stuck to my skin.`
`...It had been a few weeks since Satoshi-kun stopped showing up for baseball practice.`
`I looked for him as soon as I arrived at the field.`
`......He's not here yet... Did I get here too early...?`
`I want to see him playing in the field right when I get here......`
` I had started arriving late because of those feelings.`
`However, he wasn't here today either.`
`"......................."`
`I didn't even bother hiding my disappointment anymore.`
`Everybody knew by now how I felt.`
`The team members from Mion's class came over to try and console me...`
` but I shooed them away.`
`"......What's going on, Sonozaki-san?`
` Are you feeling sick...?"`
`Even Irie couldn't comfort me.`
`...I was aware that he, too, knew why I was like this.`
`"...I'm going home.`
` I don't feel like watching the practice today."`
`"...Look, we're having a meeting with the Okinomiya Titans later...`
` I wanted you to be there, because you're our manager..."`
`"...Don't treat me like a manager...`
` I never agreed to be one."`
`Irie looked down, not knowing what to say.`
`"All right...`
` Please help us again when you feel like it."`
`"Maybe I won't be coming back...`
` If you really need a manager, look for somebody else."`
`"...Please do come again`
` whenever you feel like it...`
` Satoshi-kun will be sad if you're not here when he comes back."`
`I ignored him and turned around.`
`I had already set up my schedule with Mion, so I didn't have to ask her every time anymore.`
`I'd tried to contact her a couple of times to ask how Satoshi-kun was doing in school, but I hadn't been able to get through to her.`
`Apparently, the hag had sensed that I might be in contact with Sis.`
`In other words, Sis was being watched.`
`...As a result, it hasn't been easy to contact her.`
`Kasai, who had been helping me contact her, seemed to also have been marked. People knew he was loyal to me.`
` I hadn't seen him for a while either.`
`All I could do was wonder how Satoshi-kun was doing...`
`...I was frustrated, because there was no way for me to know.`
`...My head was filled with worries...`
` But something surprised me out of the blue.`
`Somebody called out to me when I was about to leave the field on my bike...`
`"Mii-chan... Hello."`
`I'd never seen this girl before.`
`...Luckily, she called me 'Mii-chan.'`
` There's only one person who refers to Mion that way, as far as I know.`
`"......Rena...`
` I'm surprised to see you here."`
`Her name is Reina Ryuugu.`
`Her real name is Reina, but she wants to be called 'Rena.'`
` ...So that's what we call her.`
`She moved here in April.`
`I had some information on her, but it was all ambiguous.`
`......Sis was still a bit uncertain about her, since she's so new.`
`...It was hard for me to handle someone like that.`
` I didn't know how to act around her, as Mion.`
`...So, I decided to pretend to be in an obvious sulky mood.`
`That way, she wouldn't talk to me as much, assuming that Mion was simply feeling bad...`
` Well, that's how I really am, anyway.`
`"...Are you going home, Mii-chan?"`
`"Yeah...`
` ...I guess I'm not feeling well?`
` Sorry."`
`"Let's go together, then."`
`...I wanted to say that I'd rather be alone... but there's only one road to Hinamizawa.`
`So, asking to be alone would look odd.`
`The only way to not seem suspicious...`
` would be to walk home with her.`
`"...Yeah...`
` let's go."`
`Rena quietly nodded. I unlocked my bike.`
`"......Mii-chan, do you have an umbrella?"`
`"Nope."`
`"It might rain soon...`
` so let's hurry a bit, since you don't have one."`
`As she predicted, we were attacked by pouring rain on our way.`
`We ended up taking shelter in a small shack in front of a bus stop.`
`"It's pouring... but it doesn't look it's going to last long, since the sky over there is clear."`
`"...Yeah."`
`I heard the sound of rain pattering on the rooftop and the raindrops jumping into puddles.`
`It sounded loud, but... it made me feel strangely calm.`
`I zoned out for a moment... then Rena talked to me while looking up at the rainy sky.`
`"...I was worried about you,`
` 'cause you looked so down."`
`All the baseball team members knew I was depressed because I hadn't seen Satoshi-kun recently.`
`Most of them attend the school in Hinamizawa.`
`...So it wasn't surprising that she knew as well.`
`I hadn't been able to contact Sis these past few weeks,`
` but I was sure she had an idea of how I feel about Satoshi-kun, and how I would feel if he didn't come to his baseball practice.`
`...Sis was probably pretending to act a little depressed during her day to day in Hinamizawa to avoid creating a big gap between our moods.`
`But neither of us knew the details about the other right now.`
`...So she wouldn't be able to answer if others asked her what was wrong.`
` She'd only be able to say, 'leave me alone.'`
`That might lead more people to become worried.`
`Rena must've thought Mion was depressed.`
`That must be why she came all the way to see me.`
`...She must have known what was going on, because she knew that I was at the baseball field.`
`".........Do you feel lonely because Satoshi-kun is avoiding us...?"`
`"....................."`
`Having deduced what'd been going on with Satoshi-kun from what she just said...`
`...He'd been distancing himself from others lately because of exhaustion.`
`...That's what it sounded like, at least.`
`"......He looked like... he was very worried about Satoko-chan..."`
`"....................."`
`"...I think... he's really on edge...`
` I feel bad for him..."`
`"......He really cares about his sister......`
` He has a lot of courage."`
`What I'd said sounded hollow,`
` as I knew too well how much of a burden Satoko had become. `
`"...But... I think he'd feel even worse if you also looked that depressed... I think..."`
`".....................I don't want that."`
`"I know...`
` but if you really don't,`
` then you need to smile for him... otherwise, he might really feel cornered."`
`"....................."`
`"I know you're strong.`
` You can smile, even if it's just pretend...`
` So, I want you to smile no matter what...`
` You know that lies can become true sometimes?"`
`...What she was saying, in a nutshell, was this.`
`Both Satoshi-kun and Satoko were totally wiped out.`
`If Mion was also depressed, even though she's the sort of person who usually lightens the mood, their situation would be stuck in a vicious cycle.`
`Rena sounded more like she was trying to give me advice than trying to console me... she must be more mature than she looks.`
`Sis told me that she was a funny girl with a few bad habits.`
`...But she seemed to have another, very mature side to her...`
`"...Do you love... Satoshi-kun?"`
`"......Yeah."`
`...Though I shouldn't have told her that...`
` I immediately responded.`
`"...In that case,`
` why don't you smile?"`
`Rena smiled herself.`
`"I believe Satoshi-kun will feel better if he sees your smile...`
` I know you feel powerless now, but...`
` your smile will give him strength."`
`".....................I know what you're saying, but...`
` it's not that easy..."`
`Rena giggled and nodded.`
`"He'll come back after he's done with his part-time job."`
`...His part-time job?`
` I almost asked that question, but I managed to stop myself.`
`From the tone of Rena's voice, it sounded like it was something everyone knew.`
`"......His part-time job, huh?`
` ......I wonder when it'll end..."`
`"Until he has enough money, I guess...`
` but he'll finish by Satoko-chan's birthday, at the latest."`
`I tried to figure out what was going on from what she said.`
`I had to listen very carefully to uncover the whole picture.`
`...Satoshi-kun seemed to be working in order to make some money.`
`I don't think it's easy to find a job when you're still in school......`
` Sis might have had something to do with it.`
`His job only seemed temporary.`
`...And it seemed to have something to do with Satoko's birthday.`
`It wasn't that difficult to figure out.`
`...Satoshi was working and saving up to buy his little sister something expensive for her birthday.`
`He was trying to comfort her.`
`......Even though he was so torn up himself.`
`...Satoko again.`
`Satoshi-kun was already worn out because of her, and he was now working for her sake, even though he was exhausted.`
`...How stupid.`
` ...It would be easier for him to just forget about Satoko.`
`"............!"`
`I was startled when I realized Rena was looking straight into my eyes.`
`She was smiling, but... her eyes looked creepy.`
`I never voiced what I was thinking...`
` but she was looking at me as though she figured out that I was blaming Satoko.`
`She beamed when she noticed my fear.`
`She smiled as though she understood that I thought that way because of love......`
` She was giving me the creeps.`
`...I could hear thunder roar in the distance.`
`The rain began to pick up.`
`"...Do you feel jealous of Satoko-chan because she monopolizes Satoshi-kun?"`
`"........................"`
`I avoided answering immediately this time.`
`...But Rena seemed to know what I was thinking already.`
`"Ahahaha. I wouldn't be upset even if you did.`
` That's just how it is when you're in love."`
`"...Thanks."`
`"You've been encouraging Satoko-chan despite that...`
` That's admirable."`
`"...Of course I have...`
` She's my friend..."`
`I sounded so fake.`
` I felt like spitting on the floor.`
`"All we can do is encourage Satoko-chan and Satoshi-kun...`
` I don't know how to save them from their situation..."`
`"...Satoko is relying on Satoshi-kun way too much...`
` If she were stronger, he wouldn't have to suffer in her place."`
`"......Ahahahahaha.`
` You sound really straightforward."`
`Rena nodded with an unflinching smile even though my remarks could be taken as harsh.`
`......What was this mysterious girl thinking? ...It was difficult to get a read on her.`
`"Maybe... Satoshi-kun feels that way a little, too."`
`"Eh...?"`
`Rena kept smiling, but her smile looked strangely cold.`
`"...I think... he's tired of protecting Satoko-chan, and he's aware of that."`
`Given the type of person Rena is...`
` I don't think she'd say something if she wasn't certain of it.`
`...Because of that, she must've been confident in what she just told me.`
`"Why... do you think that?"`
`"...He said so."`
`"...What?"`
`Satoshi-kun secretly confessed to her. Rena asked me to keep it that way.`
`"Satoshi-kun told me...`
` that he felt tired of protecting Satoko-chan.`
` He was feeling guilty, though."`
`I don't think he would say something like that.`
`...But, however,`
` it wasn't likely that Rena was lying.`
`I'd just met her, so I didn't know what made me feel that way......`
` but my hunch told me that she was telling the truth.`
`...I heaved a huge sigh.`
`Satoshi-kun must've gotten so tired that he couldn't help telling someone.`
`...Even so...`
`......Even if he thought that way, he wouldn't tell somebody so easily.`
`...Maybe... Rena led him to do so.`
`She might be capable of something like that.`
`...I don't understand`
` this girl.`
`It had only been a little while since we'd met, but I'd already started talking about something I was keeping deep inside of me.`
`...Does she have some kind of supernatural power to reach into people's minds and drag out what they're thinking?`
`...It suddenly hit me that I was sitting with this creepy girl in a tiny shack.`
`...I'd been dragged into her strange world.`
`I don't think Sis has realized Rena's real personality.`
`She thinks Rena is just a funny girl with some strange habits.`
`...She would've told me if she knew.`
`"...I guess Satoshi-kun must trust you a lot if he confessed that to you....`
` Hahaha... I'm a little jealous."`
`"...It's not because he trusts me...`
` I think it's because I've experienced the same thing."`
`"You what?`
` ...Did you also have to cover for your siblings once?"`
`"Those footsteps`
` always followed me......`
` They even came to my bedside and looked down at me."`
`Huh???`
` ...Sorry, Rena.`
` What are you talking about?`
`...I turned around to face her.`
`...And got the chills.`
`...Though she was smiling... her eyes`
` looked ice cold.`
`I trembled... and froze`
` with my eyes open.`
`"......Have you experienced anything like that?`
` ...Ahaha, I guess not.`
` Probably."`
`Ahahahahaha...`
` Rena kept laughing self-derisively.`
`...I tried to figure out what she was saying.`
`"...Have you ever thought of leaving Hinamizawa`
` and moving to a big city?`
` ...Have you ever thought of doing something like that?"`
`...I didn't know how to respond.`
`Rena waited for my answer, urging me to speak with her silence.`
`"...N-`
`No...`
` I love it here."`
`"Yeah, that's right, isn't it?`
` I knew that.`
` Ahahahahahahahaha."`
`It didn't seem like a good idea to lie to her.`
`...Rena has some kind of power I can't grasp.`
`...She can read people's minds just by seeing the slightest change in their expressions.`
`So I had to tell her the truth.`
`"You'll be okay, if that's true...`
` Oyashiro-sama won't get mad at you."`
`"Oyashiro-sama...?"`
`Oyashiro-sama.`
` That's Hinamizawa's guardian deity.`
`...I couldn't understand why she mentioned that name. My mind stopped for a moment.`
`"That's right.`
` Oyashiro-sama."`
`She calmly repeated the name as if trying to teach me something.`
`Yeah...`
` I remember.`
`Oyashiro-sama never allows heathens to desecrate Hinamizawa.`
`Oyashiro-sama never allows the villagers to leave, either.`
`Those are the rules.`
`Slowly,`
` I recalled the fear of the curse which supposedly caused the dismemberment murder and the death of the Houjou couple.`
`...When I was sent to the institution...`
` I had this fear.`
`I was scared that if I went to that faraway boarding school, I'd fall under the curse.`
`But... I should be okay.`
`I escaped from the school and returned to my hometown (to Okinomiya, to be precise,`
` but it should be okay according to the kids' rules) because I love Hinamizawa.`
`The hag forces me to live this suffocating life, but I still chose to stay in this place.`
`...I don't believe I'm breaking Oyashiro-sama's rules.`
`Even though the Sonozaki family had selfishly banished me to a remote place, I came back here anyway.`
`...Oyashiro-sama should even bless me for that...`
`...I guess I'm trying to convince myself that the curse doesn't apply to me.`
`But...`
`...I think`
` I'm still afraid of it.`
`"...I love this place,`
` so I don't think I qualify for Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` You could even call me a model villager."`
`"Yes,`
` I think so, too......`
` But... I'm not sure about Satoshi-kun."`
`"...Why...?!"`
`"Satoshi-kun wants to leave Hinamizawa and run far away...`
` even if only unconsciously..."`
`.....................Eh...?`
`I gave an inaudible cry.`
`...While I was feeling sad that Satoshi-kun hadn't shown up for practice,`
`he still lived in Hinamizawa.`
`......So, I'd never even considered the thought of him going away.`
`"Are you saying that... he wants to skip town...?"`
`"Yes......`
` he's not aware of it himself, though.`
` He probably didn't notice it until Oyashiro-sama stood by his bed."`
`I still had no idea what she was talking about.`
`...I continued trying to figure out what she was saying.`
`"Everything he's going through... is a sign of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`...You feel like someone is watching you from a distance... and it follows you... Then it watches from right behind you...`
`...After that, you start hearing an extra footstep.`
` It only happens outside at first...`
` but you start hearing it even inside your house after a while.`
`Then... Oyashiro-sama keeps watching you even when you're sleeping in the dark...`
` right by your side, waiting silently...`
` for you to admit your sin.`
`Satoshi-kun told me he was having nightmares at first...`
` So, I asked him what kind of dreams he was having......`
` And those dreams he was having,`
` as it turned out,`
` were just like mine...`
`I warned him that the presence would become bigger, he'd hear an extra footstep, and feel the presence watching him in his sleep.`
` I told him to come to me if that ever happened.`
`...He must have been suspicious at first.`
`But... just as I predicted...`
` he started to feel Oyashiro-sama's presence more strongly.`
` He finally realized he could talk to me about it."`
`......Rena didn't look like she was joking.`
` She just calmly told me what had been going on.`
`I couldn't even move.`
`...I couldn't tell if her words were a joke... or the truth.`
`I could only feel stunned.`
`"I'm from Hinamizawa originally,`
` but I moved to Ibaraki Prefecture right before I went to elementary school...`
` However, when I couldn't adjust to my new environment... `
`Oyashiro-sama frequently started telling me to return to Hinamizawa, in my head......`
` But I couldn't do anything, since I was just a little kid... `
`I was forced to live there, though I felt threatened by Oyashiro-sama's voice......`
` then...`
`....................."`
`Rena paused.`
`...It looked like she didn't want to go into the details of what followed......`
` In general, she confused me even more.`
`"Anyway, I was able to come back here in the end.`
`......Oyashiro-sama forgave me......`
` I haven't felt his presence any more since then.`
`...Satoshi-kun is being subjected to the curse even though he's in Hinamizawa.`
` ......Why?`
` ...There can only be one reason.`
`It's because he wishes to abandon Hinamizawa...`
` Oyashiro-sama won't allow that.`
`...After a series of inner monologues,`
` he confessed...`
` You know he's working part-time, don't you?`
` The teddy bear he's getting for Satoko-chan costs about 100,000 yen, `
`and he's trying to get the money by her birthday.`
`Have you noticed it yet?`
`Think about it like this.`
` If he had that amount of money,`
` that'd be enough for him to run away somewhere far from here.`
`He unconsciously started to think about that,`
` about leaving Satoko-chan behind.`
`But he'd feel very guilty.`
`As you pointed out, Satoko-chan is a burden on him...`
` He's not stupid, so he's aware of that......`
` He just doesn't want to admit it, because he's the one who's supposed to protect his little sister.`
`He's been struggling with himself.`
` He thinks he's working to please Satoko-chan on her birthday.`
`......But he also feels that he might be deceiving himself, because he unconsciously wants to skip town with that money.`
`...I don't think he should run away.`
` Even if he did, he'd regret it for the rest of his life.`
` Oyashiro-sama knows that. That's why Oyashiro-sama is trying to warn him.`
`......I hope Satoshi-kun stops thinking of abandoning Satoko-chan...`
` He's working hard to make it to Satoko-chan's birthday, which is...`
` a couple of days after the Watanagashi festival?`
`......He's pushing himself too hard...`
` He believes it'll end when Satoko-chan's birthday comes.........`
` The curse keeps cautioning him `
`while he tries to figure out whether he should leave or continue protecting her."`
`...The torrential rain didn't seem to want to stop.`
`It kept pouring down on the galvanized iron roof, producing a loud noise...`
` yet in the shack, it fell completely silent.`
`What the hell was Rena talking about...?`
`I couldn't grasp even half of what she was saying.`
`The only thing I had figured out is that Satoshi-kun was struggling, confused, and in lots of pain.`
`He's suffering from Oyashiro-sama's curse?`
`......And Rena has experienced that before...?`
`The Watanagashi festival was...`
` right around the corner.`
`Oyashiro-sama's curse had struck three years in a row.`
`...There was no guarantee that it wouldn't strike a fourth time.`
`Satoshi-kun was...`
` subject to Oyashiro-sama's curse, even now?`
`Was he going to skip town?`
`Was he going to be the next victim of Oyashiro-sama's curse?`
`......Either way`
`...... he might disappear forever.`
`Could I do something to prevent it?`
`...If I didn't do anything... it would all come to a hopeless end...`
` End?`
`...I started feeling a sense of dread.`
`I didn't buy the crazy story Rena told me.`
`......But... if something really was happening to Satoshi-kun, which might bring about some kind of an end, I couldn't help feeling scared.`
`It's true, isn't it.`
`.....................My instinct is always correct.`
`I decided to contact Mion despite the danger.`
`...Mion got upset at first, but she had to listen to me.`
`"Sis...`
` what's going on`
` with Satoshi-kun?"`
`"...He looks really stressed out...`
` I can't even talk to him."`
`"......What do you mean?`
` You don't know what's going on because you can't talk to him?"`
`"......Sorry."`
`"......Sis,`
` give me another chance to trade spots again."`
`"Um, that's fine.`
` But I'm kind of busy lately attending meetings for the festival...`
` What are you planning to do?`
` Another part-time job?"`
`"I'm going to your school."`
