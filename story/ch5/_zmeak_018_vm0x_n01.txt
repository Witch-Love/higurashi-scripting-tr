`I fell comfortably asleep, and ended up staying overnight.`
` Was that just because I was tired,`
` or did someone put a drug in my food?`
`It's not like me to fall straight into a deep sleep and spend a night at grandma's house.`
`I wanted to forget about what happened in that eerie storehouse, so I got a little carried away.`
`But it feels like more than a coincidence.`
`"Why don't you wake up, grandma?"`
`"Hah, hah... hah...`
` ......You deserve this,`
` you fucking demon-hag..."`
`"Did you hear some noise earlier?`
` That was me whipping the old lady."`
`"............"`
`Mion didn't reply, but I saw her bite her lip.`
`"Don't worry,`
` I won't whip you.`
` But if you don't cooperate, I might punish her some more.`
` Next time I won't use a whip."`
`"Ahaha, I feel the same way.`
` Why would I go down the well where they tossed the victims of this secret room?"`
`"Hey, do you want to take care of her even now that she's dead?`
` I wouldn't mind, you know?`
` Huh?!"`
`"Hey, Mion...`
` Now that I think about it...... I did have a reason to kill grandma.`
` Do you know what it was?`
` ...It wasn't just because she killed Satoshi-kun.`
` It's because she lied!!"`
`"I believe you don't know anything.`
` You aren't even sure if the old lady actually trusted you.`
` But... I don't know if she forgave Satoshi-kun because of what I did.`
` She wouldn't have told you the truth."`
