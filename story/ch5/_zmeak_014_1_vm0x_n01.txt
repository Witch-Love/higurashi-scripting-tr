`"He's a real piece of work who fell into a drug habit.`
` He's been in and out of prison for drug abuse.`
` His statement says that he was interested in the series of mysterious deaths and wanted to imitate them."`
`"As a matter of fact,`
` the moron was already dead`
` by the time I got their call."`
`"So, the investigation hadn't been done that thoroughly...`
` But although I'm not convinced, my superiors are.`
` I think with that, the case will be closed."`
` ...I believe that this moron is some kind of mistake."`
`"...What if the murder actually was done by that copycat and Satoshi-kun's disappearance has nothing to do with it...? `
`In other words, what if Satoshi-kun disappeared because the Sonozaki family didn't like my relationship with him,`
` and he has nothing to do with the murder...?"`
`"...Shion-san...`
` I think if we leave things as they are, they'll conclude that the moron committed the murder.`
` If that happens, Satoshi-kun's disappearance will be treated as just another runaway minor. `
`"N-No,`
` I was just a bit surprised...`
` Sorry about that."`
