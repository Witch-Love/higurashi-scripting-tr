`"I thought you were marked by the hag.`
` Is it okay for you to be here?"`
`"It seems that Teppei Houjou fled the premises.`
` He seems to be staying at his mistress's place in Okinomiya."`
`"Teppei?`
` Who's that?`
` ......Oh, Satoshi-kun's uncle, huh?"`
`"Their aunt - Tamae Houjou, Satoshi, and Satoko are the only ones living in the house now.`
` Ever since Tamae learned that Teppei had fled to his mistress, she's been in a foul mood."`
`"So that must mean...`
` that the aunt is being even nastier to Satoko, and Satoshi-kun is taking even more indirect blows." `
`"I don't know about Satoshi-kun, but I heard that Satoko-san looks very miserable. The neighbors are spreading rumors about her."`
`"Does the hag make the decision?`
` If so, Sis should know about it by now.`
` Kasai,`
` do you know anything?"`
`"...She was tortured until she was literally torn up...`
` And everybody abandoned her...`
` Everybody did."`
