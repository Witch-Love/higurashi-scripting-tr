`I remembered.`
`I remembered that Keiichi's insensitive decision eventually caused a fatal ending. That was fate.`
`Keiichi was internally thinking that he should give the doll to Mion.`
`She was the only one who didn't get anything, so it would be natural for him to give it to her.`
`But the hesitation he was feeling was because Mion was such a close friend to him.`
`He'd been treating Mion as if she was a male friend.`
`But it would be weird to give a doll to another boy.`
`He was afraid that if he gave the doll to Mion, he would start looking at her as a girl from that point onward.`
`He wanted to continue his friendship with Mion without thinking about their difference in gender.`
`He didn't want to ruin the relationship they had at that moment.`
`That's why he couldn't give the doll to Mion.`
`Even though she was the only one without a doll, he felt so hesitant.`
`Of course, that was only how he felt. Mion didn't agree.`
`In actuality, she wished he would treat her more like a girl...`
`I walked closer to Keiichi so I could talk to him.`
`If Mion heard me telling Keiichi to give her the doll, she would resist taking it.`
`I had to make sure that no one but Keiichi could hear me.`
`I also had to make this very quick...`
`I poked Keiichi in the back.`
`"Huh?"`
`Keiichi.`
` The person who really wants that doll is the one who's bullying you the most about it.`
`I was going to say that...`
` But Keiichi opened his mouth first, even before I could say anything to him.`
`"I know."`
`I hadn't said anything to him yet.`
`But Keiichi told me that he knew.`
`I felt confused, not knowing what he just meant.`
`He turned around to face Mion, smiling mischievously.`
`"Mion, if you think I would look like a pervert with this doll, who do you think deserves to have it?`
` Huh?"`
`"I-I don't know...`
` All I'm saying is that dolls aren't for boys."`
`"I see... Then I guess you can have it.`
` Here."`
`Keiichi tossed the doll to Mion as if passing her a basketball.`
`As if forcing to her to carry his bag, or something.`
`Mion's face quickly turned red.`
` Feeling shy, Keiichi turned away from her.`
`...That was surprising.`
`He got my message just by getting a tap on his back.`
`Was Keiichi always that smart...?`
`Just one tap was all it took...`
`I don't think he would've done the same in a previous life...`
`This was just a small incident, but this world is definitely different from the previous one...`
`Or could it be...`
`Perhaps he would've given that doll to Mion even if I didn't poke him in the back...?`
`"Does he have memories from previous worlds after all...?"`
`"No way... he can't.`
` That can't be happening...."`
`I know for a fact that he doesn't have those memories.`
`But there might be something imperceptible somewhere inside his heart...`
`He might remember some of the regrets he felt in the previous worlds...`
`That's why he strongly felt he should be giving the doll to Mion this time...`
`After repeating so many lives, I'm the only one who can even notice this slight growth of his.`
` But I see it.`
` It's clearly visible to me.`
