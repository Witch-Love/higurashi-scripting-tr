`It'd been three days since he told her to stay home.`
`He got another call from that annoying teacher again, so he yelled at her and hung up the phone.`
`That woman is too persistent, Teppei thought.`
`She won't give up that easily.`
` He was sure that she'd call the child consultation center again.`
`The biggest reason why Teppei refused to let Satoko go to school was his fear that she'd seek help when going there.`
`She pretended like nothing was wrong when the social worker from the child consultation center showed up, but that was only because he was right beside her.`
`She'd probably betray him as soon as she got her chance.`
`Then the consultation center would show up immediately.`
`No, maybe even the police would come and get him for assaulting Satoko.`
`One of his friends had told him that the consultation center works with the police sometimes.`
`Teppei had a lot of weight on his shoulders.`
`If the police came, they'd end up questioning him about the other trouble he was involved in.`
` He couldn't let that happen.`
`All he needed was the money.`
`Teppei could leave this awful village behind as soon as he found his brother's bankbook.`
`Teppei usually stayed at home, as he found the way the other villagers looked at him unpleasant.`
`So when playing mahjong with his friends, he played it at Satoko's house.`
`But mahjong requires at least four people.`
`When Teppei couldn't get that many people to come over, he just stayed home alone and watched TV instead.`
`He started using this ample free time to sniff around the house for his treasure.`
`Satoko would end up cleaning the mess he made.`
`Besides, it wasn't his home anyway.`
`What did it matter to him how much furniture he broke?`
`He cleared out the closet, and went up to the attic...`
` He also pulled out all the chests and searched them thoroughly.`
`His wife had been a pretty clever woman.`
`She must have hid it somewhere very unusual.`
`He messed up the whole first floor`
` and went up to the second floor to search some more.`
` The next moment, Satoko went and tried to tackle him.`
`"Not Nii-nii's room...!!!"`
`"What the hell?!!"`
`"No! You can't go inside Nii-nii's room...!!!"`
`Teppei immediately assumed that she was hiding the bankbook in there.`
`He threw her off and forced his way inside the room.`
`...However, Satoko tried to stop him with all of her might.`
`It was amusing for Teppei to see Satoko resisting him to that extent, but it also surprised him a little.`
` He asked her why she didn't want him to go into Satoshi's room.`
`"Hic......! That room belongs to... Nii-nii...`
` Nii-nii will be hurt... if he comes home and... sees his room destroyed...`
` Ugh... ugh...!!"`
`"You don't want me there just 'cause it's your brother's room? You don't even know if he's still alive!"`
`"Nii-nii is alive!! He will come back home!!`
` Waaaaaaaah!!`
` Don't destroy his room!!"`
`"...What are you saying? I'm not going to destroy the room.`
` I'm just...`
` trying to clean it up.`
` Why would you have to save this room for someone who's not here anymore?`
` I need to clean it up."`
`"No!!`
` No, you can't! Waaaaaaah!! Waaaaaaaaah!!`
` Nii-nii!! Nii-nii!!`
` Waaaaaaaaah!!!"`
`"The hell? You really don't want me to go inside, huh...?"`
`Satoko's crazed behavior convinced him that he should stop provoking her for the moment.`
`...While Teppei was very talented at threatening people,`
`despair makes cowards courageous.`
`If he ignored Satoko and tore apart the room, she might just run away.`
`He didn't want Satoko to be nearby, but he also couldn't let her run loose.`
`"Fine then!! If you promise to be a good girl, I won't go inside this room.`
` Alright?`
` Got it?"`
`"Yes... yes..."`
`"But if you make me mad,`
` I'm gonna rip this room apart!`
` If you escape from this house or tell people about what's happening...`
` everything in there's gonna end up in the garbage.`
` Get it?!"`
`"...Yes... yes... Thank you for giving me a chance..."`
`Teppei was sure the bankbook was inside Satoshi's room.`
`...But Satoko would lose it if he went inside.`
`He wasn't pleased about the promise he made with her, but at least it would keep Satoko under control.`
`...It might not hurt him to send her off to school.`
`If he kept her home again tomorrow, that teacher might come to the house with the police in tow.`
`He was only keeping her at home because he was afraid that Satoko would talk to other people.`
`If she wasn't going to do that, it'd be better for him to send her to school.`
`He could sneak into Satoshi's room while she was out.`
`"Satoko, you've been a good girl, so I guess your cold is all better now.`
` Go back to school tomorrow."`
`"Thank you so much... Thank you so much..."`
`He was the one who told her to say 'thank you' when he gives her approval to do something.`
`But it annoyed him to hear her say it over and over.`
`"Get out of my sight, you little brat. Gah!`
` You're so annoying!!"`
