`A huge crowd had formed in front of the library.`
`It was hard to believe that over fifty people had assembled in front of such a quiet place.`
`"K!!`
` Things are getting interesting today!!`
` That's Maebara-san! He's our leader today!!"`
`"""Yo!! Glad to meet you!!"""`
`Kameda-kun had brought a bunch of athletes with him.`
`They were all very tall and full of spirit.`
`Being greeted by a bunch of big people at once made me feel uncomfortable.`
`Whoops, I shouldn't feel so intimidated!!`
`The commander can't act bashful in front of his troops!`
`Following after them were our nameless comrades who sympathized with our plight at Angel Mort yesterday.`
`...I hate to say it, but I never expected any of them to actually show up.`
`Seeing them all here to support us made me feel glad.`
`They seemed plenty pumped up too, raising up fervorous cries (shrieks?).`
`Kameda-kun did so much for me. He brought not only his teammates, but also people from Angel Mort...`
` I couldn't thank him enough.`
`"Don't worry, K! We're all brothers at Angel Mort!`
` I heard from the people who went to the Dessert Fiesta today that... the dessert named 'Innocent Blue Sundae' is the best one! `
`Let's eat it together this summer!!"`
`"Keiichi-kun!`
` This is incredible!`
` You gathered this many people by yourself?"`
`"Hello.`
` I never expected you'd get this many people here.`
` Good job, hee hee."`
`"Tomitake-san, Takano-san!`
` Why are you two here?"`
`"Oh, you didn't know?`
` They told us they'd come at the meeting last night.`
` The coach is supposed to be here too..."`
`"Sorry I made you wait so long!`
` I'm sorry for being so late.`
` It took me a while to leave the clinic."`
`"Woooow!`
` Coach, that's amazing. It's amazing!!"`
`Coach had brought some sashes, headbands, and banners with him.`
`...He was so well-prepared!!`
`The sashes and headbands read "Save Satoko Houjou!" and "The consultation center must take action immediately!". They were perfect for our protest!`
`He had brought lots of extras along, too. Takano-san and Shion handed them out to other supporters.`
`"You know, Coach, I loathe that style of yours...`
` but you've earned some respect today."`
`"You know, I really like these things.`
` Not all sixty of us know each other,`
` but when we all wear the same headbands, I start to feel a real sense of unity!"`
`"It feels like I'm back at the dam conflict.`
` The people of Hinamizawa were wearing headbands and sashes just like these. It was like they were invincible.`
` No one could make them stop!"`
`Tomitake-san was exactly right.`
`Even the kids from Okinomiya were willing to wear the headbands.`
`It was like we were supporting a baseball team.`
`"Here, Rika-san.`
` It took us a while to get all of these made..."`
`"......Irie..."`
`"I'll do everything I can!`
` I'll do my very best to help us rescue Satoko-chan!"`
`"Here, these are yours, Keiichi-kun!`
` It felt like a field trip yesterday, but today it's totally different!"`
`"Yeah, I agree...!!`
` I figured showing up in greater numbers would intimidate them, but this has way more impact!!`
` Bluffs really are important after all!!"`
`"It's just about time.`
` Call us to attention, captain!"`
`"Captain...?`
` I'm just the person who set this up..."`
`"Keiichi-kun, you need to act more like a leader!`
`Get up there and stand strong!"`
`I walked out in front of everyone while Tomitake-san took pictures.`
`Everyone went quiet and turned their gaze to me.`
`......I felt so nervous.`
` But at the same time, I also felt really thrilled to see all of our comrades here.`
`"Thanks for being here today, everyone!!!`
` As you know, it's been four days since my classmate Satoko Houjou was taken by her uncle!! `
`How can he claim to be her legal guardian? He used to beat her, and he neglected her for a whole year so he could live with his lover here in Okinomiya!! `
`The child consultation center must urgently take care of this matter and save Satoko from him!!`
` However, they're putting her case on hold!`
` They just don't understand how much of an emergency this is!! `
`Today we're going to attempt our third appeal, so as to get them to save her as soon as possible!!!"`
`"For those who saw Satoko-chan at school today, you should all know!`
` She was at her wit's end after only four days!`
` We can't leave her in that environment any longer!!"`
`"This is our third attempt!`
` We have so many people on our side, too!!`
` Let's let them know how important this is!!`
` We're not going to neglect our friend!!"`
`"...Amazing!`
` This really is the return of the dam conflict!"`
`"Maebara-kun wasn't even living here when that happened.`
` This is quite interesting.`
` There must be something about this village that brings people together..."`
`"That's just the culture here, I think.`
` Something like this happening was inevitable."`
`"I come from a city where neighbors don't even know each other's faces... I'm a little jealous."`
`"...That's a bit rich coming from someone who keeps complaining about the lack of trains."`
`"All units prepared for assault!`
` Give us the order to lay our lives down today, Your Excellency!!"`
`"Press our demands, rescue the target!!`
` Everyone, follow K's command!!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Yeah!`
` Yeeeeeeeah!!!"`
`Everyone had that much vigor before we'd even entered the building.`
`They had to have heard what was going on outside.`
`In fact, panicked-looking people were staring at us out the windows.`
`"Well, here goes nothing!"`
`Irie pushed me forward, and I took the first step of our third attempt, with the weight of sixty people on my shoulders.`
`We went through the automatic doors, and slowly crossed twenty meters to the counter...`
`"...How will they take this?`
` The first day it was just a counselor. Yesterday was a manager.`
` Think we'll get the guy in charge today?"`
`"I don't know...`
`but I'm sure they'll understand just how much we care about her...!"`
`"H-Hello... How may I help you today...?"`
`"Same as yesterday.`
` We're here to appeal for immediate action on behalf of Satoko Houjou!"`
`At the far end of the office, I saw the manager from yesterday talking to a guy sitting behind an important-looking desk.`
`I could tell he was intimidated to see so many people.`
`Shion said that this was the day we'd finally close the deal, but I couldn't be that optimistic yet.`
`...To be honest, our current numbers were probably the maximum number of people that I could get.`
`So what would we do... if things didn't work out today?`
`I put up a brave front, but internally I was nearly cracking with the anxiety.`
`But looking at the hopeful, encouraging expression on Rena's face as she walked beside me helped disperse those timid feelings.`
`Rena might hold the very same worries inside of her heart.`
`Everyone must be wondering if we can really save Satoko or not.`
`But today, we were supporting each other by hiding those worries.`
`That was unmistakably our team's strong point.`
`We could never have gathered so much energy and strength if we were alone.`
`That power can only be created when people work together!`
`It takes forever for a drop of water to wear away at one rock, but a tsunami can break it into pieces in a second!`
`The manager approached the counter.`
`He started speaking to me,`
`saying that as the meeting room wasn't open today, he couldn't let us all into one room.`
`However, the head of the office was willing to see us, so we could use the reception area in front of his desk.`
`Since the room is so small, however, he asked us to choose three representatives to come inside.`
`"I am truly sorry...`
` We hope you'll understand this is out of concern for our visitors, and show that you're willing to cooperate."`
`We were here with all these people, and they were only letting three of us inside?`
`I wanted to refuse their offer, but Mion told me to take it.`
`"If we occupied the office with our numbers, they could fault us for obstructing their business.`
` I think they're intimidated enough. `
`The head of the office is willing to talk with you today. I think that's the best treatment you can get from them."`
`"......They're all shaking like scaredy-cats."`
`"Ahahaha! Meow meow!`
`Still, it's definitely a lie that the meeting room isn't available today."`
`"I think so too.`
` But Mii-chan is right. I think they're intimidated enough."`
`"The head of the office is the top of the whole organization.`
` If he's willing to talk to us, we might have to compromise as well."`
`"...If we refuse to see him, that will go on the record.`
` We don't want them to be able to claim that we refused to talk to him."`
`"I think we should make it clear that we're here to have a conversation..."`
`Hmm.`
`It was good to get suggestions from so many different people.`
`If it was only me, I would've just gotten pissed off and left.`
`That was probably not the best idea.`
`...Once again, I felt how important it was that we were a team.`
`"I understand.`
` Three of us will go talk to him, then...`
` ...But who should it be?"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you have to go.`
`Other than you, I think Coach and Mii-chan would be the best choice!"`
`"If the head of the office recognizes me, they'll think that this is the Sonozaki family's doing.`
` ...I can't let him think that, since my family has nothing to do with this case. `
`...Mm, I'm really sorry, but it's those adult circumstances again."`
`"Saving Satoko is our fight. That old hag has nothing to do with this anyway.`
`How about you, Rena-san?`
` You should go and talk with them!"`
`"I don't mind... but how about you, Rika-chan?"`
`"......Meep?"`
`"As Satoko-chan's best friend, I think you should be a representative."`
`"..............."`
`Rika-chan is a quiet girl, so it'd be hard for them to understand what she's thinking.`
`However, she's Satoko's best friend.`
`She had been living with her for the past year, as if they were family.`
` She has the strongest bond with Satoko out of any of us.`
`"All right. Coach, Rika-chan, and me! We're going in!"`
`"Roger.`
` I'll get everyone under control."`
`Mion winked at me and started explaining the situation to everyone else.`
