`Hi, this is Ryukishi07.`
`Thank you for playing\nHigurashi When They Cry Kai - Ch.7 Minagoroshi.`
`This time around, the scenario was almost like the answer page in a book of riddles.`
`Or maybe the scenario was like a side dish we enjoyed alongside all the scenarios up to now.`
`You can take it how you like.`
`I just hope you enjoyed it.`
`I was very nervous about releasing this scenario, because a mystery is only good when it's still a mystery.`
`This scenario marks the end of that mystery.`
`To be honest, I didn't want to release this chapter for a while.`
`However, way too many similar stories are being published with no answers at all.`
`A book of riddles means nothing if there's no answer page in the back.`
`Coming up with an answer when you have no way to see if it's right or not is a little sad, I think.`
`If there are no answers, you can't get any joy out of reading a book of riddles.`
`I regret to see that there are way too many stories out there`
` that don't offer this kind of joy.`
`That's why I decided to release something that you can compare your answer to for this series.`
`Since this world had a rather irregular presentation, there may not have been many people who reached what might be called the right answer.`
`But it's not really about whether your answer was right or wrong.`
` It's much more about how many questions you raised when reading the story and how many answers you were able to find.`
`Thank you all very much for the solutions you've sent me.`
`They were all wonderful theories, and some were thought out so much more than the actual story that I frequently thought about making them the right answer (wry laugh).`
`Also, your support has given me courage to finish writing the seventh chapter of this series.`
`Thank you very much for supporting Higurashi.`
`Finally, I would like to apologize about how I portrayed the child consultation center.`
`I don't know what it was like in 1983,`
` but child consultation centers are not mean places like I depicted in my story.`
`I made the characters look so unfeeling,`
` but in reality,`
` the government today is the number one hero for us civilians.`
`In fact, those involved with child welfare and youth education are all extremely passionate and selflessly devoted people.`
`I'm sorry for giving them such a negative image in this chapter.`
`The next chapter, Matsuribayashi, is going to be the last one of the series.`
`I'm overwhelmed by the pressure of writing the last chapter of Higurashi When They Cry,`
` which turned out to be such a long story.`
`I hope you'll continue your kind support.`
`Thank you all very much.`
`                               07th Expansion`
