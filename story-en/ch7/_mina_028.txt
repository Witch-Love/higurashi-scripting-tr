`The time was one in the morning.`
`As it's hardly a big city, 1 AM in Hinamizawa is the middle of the night. The darkness here gets very deep.`
`There was light leaking out from the first floor where two detectives sat on guard, but everything else was pitch black.`
`Even the moonlight seemed indistinct.`
`"It's time.`
` Two detectives are downstairs.`
` It's been more than an hour since the light went out above them.`
` Awaiting orders to begin the attack."`
`"...What a beautiful night. You have permission to engage."`
`"...Should we terminate the detectives?"`
`"Yes.`
` Everyone in the Furude shrine will be demoned away tonight.`
` ...It's better that way."`
`"HQ to Phoenix.`
` Commence the mission. Terminate the two detectives.`
` You do not have permission to fire.`
` I repeat, you do not have permission to fire your weapons.`
` HQ to Nightingale. `
`Phoenix has commenced the mission.`
` Shut down the phone lines."`
`"Roger.`
` We're shutting them down."`
`They had been working to disable the phone lines, just in case their target tried to contact the police during the attack.`
`That mission was what Ooishi happened to bump into.`
`"...Let's begin.`
` Phoenix 1 to all units.`
` Be prepared when you enter.`
` Terminate the two detectives on the first floor, and the one companion on the second.`
` Do not leave any evidence. `
`Do not fire your weapons or use any gas.`
` Use your tasers.`
` Remember, they have guns. Do not let them fire."`
`"Come on, don't embarrass me, Okonogi.`
` Hee hee."`
`"I'm just doing my job.`
` Phoenix 7 and 8, advance forward.`
` Backup teams, secure the perimeter."`
`"Roger.`
` We're heading in now."`
`The two men in uniform slowly approached the building.`
`The Mountain Dogs' uniform is gray, so it didn't blend in with their surroundings at all.`
`However, it doesn't look as suspicious as real camouflage suits.`
`......Of course, they looked suspicious enough creeping up to the house like that anyway.`
`They could both see light leaking from the door and hear the voices of the detectives.`
`Rika would typically use this sliding door to get inside.`
`The door was locked, but the Mountain Dogs had obtained a spare key a long time ago.`
`They put the key in the keyhole, but it wouldn't go in smoothly.`
`They were certain it would make some kind of noise when they turned it.`
`The detectives would notice them the minute they did that.`
` They'd have to rush inside and defeat them in one swift burst.`
`Phoenixes 7 and 8 glanced at each other.`
`"This is Phoenix 7. We've arrived at the target location.`
` Waiting for your command."`
`"...Takano here.`
` ...Make it nice and clean.`
` Go ahead."`
`"Roger.`
` We're breaking in!"`
`Clack clack...!`
`He turned the key in a hurry and opened the lock.`
`By the time the detectives turned around, the door was already open and the two Mountain Dogs had stepped inside.`
`They had aimed their weapons at the detectives while the latter were still turning around.`
`In a fight like that, the first two seconds are the most crucial moments.`
`"Ugh!!"`
`"...Agh!!"`
`The detectives collapsed, making minimal noise.`
`There were needles stuck in their bodies, and those needles were connected via wires to the attackers' guns.`
`In other words, the weapons those two had weren't ordinary guns. They were stun guns in the shape of firearms.`
`Instead of bullets, they shoot out electric needles that electrocute their victims into unconsciousness.`
`Normally they would be nonlethal weapons that allow the shooter to capture their victim without harming them much, but their tasers had been modified.`
`The two Dogs started walking up the stairs as soon as they confirmed that the detectives were no longer breathing.`
`But in the next moment, they heard a loud noise above them.`
`"This is Phoenix 10!`
` R and her companion have noticed us!`
` They just jumped out from the second floor window!`
` They're running into the forest!`
`Attention, Phoenix 4 and 5. They're heading your way. Capture them!!"`
`"Roger, let's go!"`
`Phoenix 4 spotted the two girls and started after them, but he suddenly stepped on something hard.`
`Pow pow pow!!`
`With a cheap-sounding explosion, the area was filled with smoke.`
`That was the trap Satoko had set using firecrackers.`
`That had proven to be a very fortunate idea.`
`The Mountain Dogs dropped to the ground, assuming that they were under fire.`
`That gave Rika and Satoko a chance to escape.`
`"Who are they?!`
` Are they the organization from Tokyo that you were talking about?!"`
`"......I think so.`
` Just run!`
` We're dead if they catch us!"`
`"What's going on?!`
` What was that noise?!"`
`"This is Phoenix 5. Someone was shooting at us!`
` R has escaped.`
` We'll continue the pursuit!!"`
`"Sh-Shit! They were just some firecrackers!`
` Damn it!!"`
`"Heh heh heh heh...`
` That must be Satoko-chan's handiwork.`
` She's pretty good... hee hee."`
`"...What?!`
` Hurry up!`
` Don't let them escape inside someone's house!"`
`"This is Phoenix 18! I've spotted the target!`
` I need some backup!!"`
`"They know this area very well.`
` If we don't get them now, we'll definitely lose them."`
`This wasn't a game of hide and seek. It was a game of tag.`
`Several men in uniform were chasing after Rika and Satoko.`
`...They weren't idiots, so they didn't waste energy on a futile act of shouting "wait."`
`This was a quiet, deadly game of tag in the middle of the night.`
`"Hah, haah haah!!`
` Where are we going?"`
`"......Let's, let's split up to try and shake them off!`
` We'll meet at Mii's house!`
` Her basement will be safe, and we can contact the police from there!!"`
`Satoko had no idea that Mion had a basement in her house, but she didn't have time to ask anything about it under her current circumstances.`
` All she did was nod.`
`Bang!!`
`The next moment, I felt my left foot catch on something, and I fell down to the ground.`
`I must have tripped on a rock or a piece of concrete...`
`"R-Rika!!"`
`"Get out of here, Satoko!!`
` You'll be killed!!"`
`But Satoko wouldn't move on without me.`
`She came back to lend me a hand.`
`I stood up without her help, but this cost us too much time.`
`One of the men had almost caught up with us.`
` I didn't know what to do.`
`...But Satoko, upon seeing him, quickly reacted!`
`"Aaaaaaaaaah!!!"`
`"Uuugh!!"`
`Satoko ran toward him and kicked him with all her might.`
`Her foot had landed right in his face. I wish I had a camera.`
`But there were two more of them right behind the first man.`
`I can see them clearly now.`
` They're the gardeners from that landscape company...`
`...They're wearing the same uniforms Okonogi is always wearing.`
`They must be the Mountain Dogs!`
`Now I'm certain that Takano is the culprit.`
`And now that I know that, I can do something about it in the next world!!!`
`But... if I die now, will I lose my memory again?!`
`I can't die now.`
` I need to survive so I can keep my memories!!`
`Satoko took something out of her pocket and threw it at them.`
`It was something like sand, and it blinded them.`
` However, even that could only buy us a few seconds.`
`Satoko tried to run, but she froze as soon as they aimed their weapons at us.`
`Their stun guns are only shaped like firearms.`
`Satoko, not knowing that, thought they were real guns.`
`Knowing that she'll be shot if she turned and ran, Satoko tried to attack them instead!!`
`Of course, there are three of them.`
` Most would think it impossible to drive them off, but Satoko didn't think about that.`
`She had a 100% chance of dying if she tried to run.`
` Then she might as well fight back, because she might have a 1% chance of defeating them.`
`Satoko is determined to save me, even at her own expense.`
`But I can't stay in this world if it means losing Satoko...!`
`I'm dying anyway! I'd rather die for Satoko's sake than lose her!!`
`But...!`
` Another me was shouting in my mind!`
` If I don't survive this, I'll lose this memory!`
`If I die without keeping this memory, this life and everything I've learned will all be wasted!`
` Should I escape and leave Satoko behind?`
`That's right. I should use this experience to my advantage in my next life!`
`I should just let go of her in this world!`
`"No way.`
` That really would make me a witch!!"`
`But I know in my heart.`
`There's no way I can win against these guys.`
`I'm sure their backup will get here if we take our time to fight them.`
`Should I fight them for her, or should I leave so I can confront my true enemy...?`
`"Satoko!!!"`
`Satoko's bravery gives me courage.`
`If I left her, I'd lose my motivation to defeat fate!`
`I don't care if I lose my memories.`
`It only took a hundred years for me to get this information.`
`I don't care if I have to spend another hundred years in this same June, I can't leave Satoko!!!`
`"Satoko!!`
` I'm fighting too!!"`
`"Rika?!`
` I told you to go!"`
`I had noticed something.`
` They're only aiming at Satoko.`
`There must be a reason why they can't shoot me.`
`So I stood in front of Satoko to protect her.`
` Just as I expected, they put their guns down and prepared to take us out without weapons.`
`"......You guys are the Mountain Dogs.`
` So Takano's behind this?"`
`".........."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm so stupid.`
` I know who you are but I chose not to run.`
` I'm not going to run.`
` Even if you're going to kill me now.`
` Someone once told me`
` that fate can be destroyed as easily as a piece of paper!"`
`They must think this is my final speech. They let me talk until I was finished.`
`"You people are pathetic.`
` ...That's why you will never kill me!!"`
`The next moment, one of them dropped to the ground!`
`Keiichi had run toward him and kicked him from behind.`
` Keiichi had kicked him right in the small of his back, and the Dog was squirming on the ground.`
`The other two tried to retaliate, but they were too late.`
`Mion grabbed one of the guys' arms from behind, and flipped him down to the ground.`
`It must be some kind of martial art.`
` I've seen something like that in an action movie before.`
`Rena tried to push the remaining Dog down with all her strength, but that wasn't enough to take him out.`
`He tried to aim his gun at Rena...`
`but she had already done what she was supposed to.`
`All she needed to do was get his attention.`
`Shion had snuck up behind him and she fired her stun gun into his neck.`
`The stun gun made a snapping noise, and the Dog fell down to the ground with the rest of his friends.`
`"Wow.`
` Kasai told me this was illegally modified. It works pretty well!"`
`"Shion, hit this guy too!"`
`"Are you guys okay?`
` That was close!`
` You ran so fast it took us a lot of time to catch up!"`
`"I'm really glad we stuck around!`
` We were waiting out here in case anything happened!"`
`"You mean... you stayed out here without going back home?"`
`"Yup.`
` I saw someone who looked suspicious staring at the shrine when we were leaving."`
`"I'm really surprised you saw him in this darkness!`
` Neither lies nor camouflage work on you, huh!"`
`So, figuring he would leave if they spoke to him, they secretly staked out that suspicious man.`
` They'd started following us as soon as they heard the sound of the firecrackers.`
`"...I never expected I'd be saved like this."`
`"We can't stay here any longer!`
` What should we do now?"`
`"We were trying to get to Mion-san's house.`
` You have a basement there, apparently...?"`
`"The underground storehouse.`
` That's a perfect spot.`
`We've also got some weapons inside there."`
`"Shhhh!!`
` Don't say that out loud!`
`Anyway, I think that's a good idea.`
` There's several secret passages in there, so we can get the drop on them!"`
`"Come on, let's go!`
` They're still after us!"`
`A white van was approaching us at high speed.`
`It obviously belonged to the Mountain Dogs.`
`The van stopped not far from us, and more people in uniform jumped out.`
` There were at least six of them!`
`If we all run, the slowest runner might get caught.`
`So we should take them down while we can!`
`I don't know if they have a license, but Mion and Shion know how to drive a car.`
`We can take their van and get away from here!`
`"There's six of them!`
` That's perfect!`
` Let's beat them unconscious and steal their van!"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` That's a good idea!"`
`"Let's go get them!!"`
`The Mountain Dogs were ready to chase us.`
`They had no idea that we would try and attack them instead.`
`Rena is always the first one to make a move in this kind of situation.`
`She gets so determined once a decision is made!!`
`She immediately singled out one Dog and punched him in the nose.`
`Another one tried to grab her from behind, but Keiichi kicked him in the side as hard as he could.`
`"Hey, Rena, watch your back!"`
`"I'll leave that to you, Keiichi-kun.`
` Please look after me!"`
`"I'm kinda curious about what you were like back in Ibaraki.`
`You sure don't hesitate to punch people."`
`"And you don't hesitate to zap people with an illegal stun gun!"`
`Given that Shion had that stun gun, the Mountain Dogs were reluctant to go after her.`
`They were scared of the very dangerous weapon she had in her hand.`
`But thanks to that, Shion had stopped one of them for certain.`
`It was fortunate for us that they didn't have any guns of their own.`
`They had no way of countering Shion's stun gun.`
`Satoko attacked him from behind.`
`She encircled his neck with a jump rope and pulled.`
`Shion followed up, quickly hitting him with her stun gun.`
`What was I doing during all that?`
` The only thing I can do is run around and try to get their attention.`
`They're pursuing me, after all.`
`They want to catch me more than anything else.`
`But that leaves them open to attacks from my friends.`
`Keiichi had already hit the one trying to grab me. `
`I think we have a chance here.`
`We may not be able to take all of them down, but we can try and find a chance to escape to their vehicle.`
`"With what Rika-chan said, I thought these guys would be really strong, but they're not that bad!"`
`"That's just how strong we club members are!"`
`"Not being afraid is probably the secret to strength.`
` Sis's club activities are practically training to rid you of your hesitation."`
`If we all fight together...`
` we can win this six-on-six battle!`
`If any one of us wasn't here, they'd beat us easily.`
` We'd end up dead.`
`If my friends hadn't stayed behind, I would have been killed by now!`
`We can do it! We can make it!!`
`The Dogs Shion took down with her stun gun were starting to wake up.`
`The ones that we knocked out earlier were also up and chasing us again.`
` We have to get out of here!!`
`This isn't the time for me to just be running around.`
`"...Fine.`
` Let's see what I can do."`
`"............Rika..."`
`"Hanyuu, I know you still can't believe in hope, just like always.`
` Stay there and see what my stubbornness can do!`
` I'm going to change this fate!`
` I'm going to do it right here! `
`Let me show you what I'm capable of!"`
`"All right, everyone!`
` We're going to finish this right now! Take down whoever is in front of you!`
` Then we're going to grab their car and get out of here!"`
`"...Yes.`
` I'm going to do this."`
`"You go, Rika-chan!!`
` Alright, let's gooooooo!!!"`
`On Keiichi's signal, we attacked six of the Mountain Dogs in unison.`
`Time gradually slowed down... I truly felt like I was trying to overcome that impossible wall of time and change my fate.`
`However, time continued to slow even further... until it stopped.`
`......What's going on?`
`It felt like the film reel of a movie had gotten hung up partway through.`
` Like time itself has come to a standstill.`
`"............Hanyuu...?`
` What's this all about...?"`
`"......The time has come."`
`"What?!`
` .........Why......?"`
`Wearing a sad expression, Hanyuu pointed at Keiichi.`
`I finally noticed something.`
`All my friends had noticed already...`
` except for Keiichi.`
`"...K...... Keiichi.`
`...What's that floating... in front of your chest?"`
`"What do you mean?`
` ............Huh?`
` What... is this...?"`
`Time had stopped`
` just when Keiichi was about to hit his opponent.`
` He then realized`
` that something was floating in front of his heart.`
`It was............`
` a metallic silver cone.`
` ...That was the first thing`
` I could`
` think of.`
`".........N......`
` No, Kei-chan......"`
`"What......`
` What the hell is this...?`
` ...Is this......`
` a bullet...?"`
`That's exactly what it was.`
`...The bullet had stopped about fifteen centimeters away from Keiichi's chest, just before it would enter his body.`
`That's right.`
` Once time starts moving again, it will slam into his chest.`
`In other words... it's too late.`
` Keiichi will immediately die when time starts up again.`
`"Wh... Who shot it...?`
` Those six guys didn't have any guns!"`
`".........L... Look...!`
` Over there, by the van!!!"`
`Satoko couldn't point at the van.`
` Time had completely stopped, after all.`
`We could see another person standing near the van.`
`...There had actually been seven people inside,`
` not six.`
`That seventh person was the one who fired the bullet.`
`We hadn't seen her at all.`
`That person is someone we all know very well...`
` Yes... it's Takano.`
`"It... It's Takano-san...!`
` She shot the gun...?!`
` She shot Keiichi-kun?!"`
`In the frozen world, Takano was smiling, still aiming her gun at Keiichi...`
`Takano had been watching us from the van this whole time.`
`She came out and fired her gun, knowing that we hadn't seen her at all.`
`"......Heh... heh heh heh heh!`
` I see... I get it now.`
` So Takano-san was the bad guy all along..."`
`"What are we going to do!`
` Kei-chan! Can't you try and twist your body to avoid the bullet!?"`
`"Don't be stupid!`
` Time has totally stopped.`
` I can't move at all...!"`
`"Th, Then, try moving right as soon as time starts moving again!`
` That might make a difference!"`
`...Everyone was desperate to save Keiichi.`
` However, no matter how hard we thought, we couldn't come up with any ideas to save him from the bullet. `
`We were so desperate that Keiichi started to laugh.`
`"......I really don't know what's going on.`
` ...But there's nothing that can be done.`
` I'm dead the minute time starts moving again.`
` Even if I don't die, I won't be of any help to you guys anymore.`
` So, listen. `
`Just give up on me.`
` You only need to think about taking these guys down and getting inside of that van!"`
`"N... Never.`
` You can't die!`
` I don't want to lose you...!!`
` Hanyuu, are you telling me that this is my fate?!`
` Are you saying that there's no way to overcome this?"`
`"..........It's okay, Rika.`
` ...You won't remember this.`
` You won't......"`
`"No, no!!`
` Kei-chan is not going to die!"`
`"Stop it, Mii-chan!`
` Let's concentrate on taking them down!`
` I'm sure Keiichi wouldn't want us spending time turning back to him as he falls!"`
`"That's exactly how I feel, Rena.`
` Guys, take care of Rika-chan.`
` Get out of here and contact Coach.`
` ...They probably killed Ooishi-san...`
` That's why he never showed up.`
` Listen,`
` promise you'll all survive. Promise me!!"`
`"...Keiichi...!"`
`"Rika-chan, I'm sorry.`
` ......I'm the one who told you that we could change destiny... but I'm going to have to retire now."`
`"Heh`
` heh`
` heh`
` heh`
` heh...`
` hee`
` hee`
` hee`
` hee`
` hee..."`
`It sounded just like Takano's regular laughter... but it was the scariest noise I'd ever heard.`
`"Are you ready to let go of your life now?"`
`".........Takano-san, we haven't lost just yet..."`
`"Hee hee hee.`
` Done watching your life flash before your eyes?"`
`The silence suddenly ended, and the clamor of reality returned...!`
`An explosive sound then hit Keiichi straight in the chest.`
`I watched Keiichi collapse right in front of me.`
`He fell down on his back while his blood splattered everywhere.`
` ...And after that, he stopped moving.`
`There's no way any of us weren't shocked by that.`
`We tried to take down the foes in front of us,`
` but more came from behind.`
`We tried to struggle as best we could, but there was no way we could win against all those adults.`
`I did my best to fight them off, but they pulled my hair and picked me up as if I weighed nothing.`
`I heard everyone's desperate screams of resistance.`
`The comforting and courageous unity we showed right before Keiichi was shot shattered like glass.`
`The debris of that glass lay sadly on the ground.`
`Takano's annoying laughter was still echoing inside my ears.`
`"Takano to HQ.`
` I've taken care of it.`
` I need what I told you before.`
` I also need someone to clean up the bodies.`
` Send me five bags, and some water to clean up the area.`
` Understand?"`
`She needs five bags...?`
` My body froze up, but time did not.`
`Takano, laughing, pointed her gun at Mion's head.`
`"......H... Hey, are you kidding me?!"`
`"I've always wanted to see the tattoo on your back.`
` I'm going to take a peek at it later."`
`"S-Sure, have a look, if you want!`
` It's nothing special!"`
`"Oh?`
` You don't think I'll find it interesting?"`
`"Stop!! Don't shoot her!!!"`
`Takano shook her head in response to Rena's scream.`
`"I have to kill her.`
` She's the leader of your club, so she has to go first."`
`"N...`
` No...`
` ...S...`
` Sto--"`
`There was a dull noise, followed by Mion's body twitching.`
`We all tried to break free from the men restraining us as Takano calmly shot Mion.`
`However, they were too strong, and all we could do was squirm like insects.`
`...Takano was enjoying watching us struggle...`
`She then stepped towards Satoko...`
`but Shion started screaming curses at her.`
`"My, my.`
` You want to be shot before her?`
` You could've stayed alive a few more seconds if you were nice and quiet."`
`"...S-Stop it, Shion-san!!`
` Don't agitate her like that!!"`
`I know why she's doing that.`
` ......Shion wants to protect Satoko for as long as she can.`
`...She's trying to do what Satoshi told her to.`
`Takano didn't care one whit for Shion's feelings.`
` Stepping over Keiichi's body, she approached Shion.`
`"I get it now...`
` You killed Satoshi-kun, didn't you...?`
` Isn't that the truth?!"`
`"Sorry, I don't like giving out secrets.`
` So I'm not telling.`
` ...Hee hee hee hee!"`
`Shion's body twitched.`
`That had followed the dull sound of another gunshot.`
`...Just two dull sounds had stolen away the lively Sonozaki sisters.`
` It didn't add up...`
`I started shaking from fear when it hit me just how easily Takano can take away lives.`
`"......I-Is it that amusing for you to take away innocent lives?!`
` You monster!!"`
`"Oh, so you want to die next?`
` You were going to be the last one if you stayed quiet."`
`Keiichi, Mion and Shion died... the oldest one of us left was Rena.`
`Rena didn't want to see Satoko and me die before she did.`
`"......So you were the culprit behind the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa...`
` ...Do you think you're Oyashiro-sama's proxy or something?"`
`"Hee hee hee.`
` I'm not a proxy.`
` I'm handing out divine punishment.`
` It's too bad that you're not going to see it.`
` Soon enough, Oyashiro-sama's wrath is going to destroy the whole village. `
`But I'm the one who's going to make that happen.`
` It's my curse.`
` Yes, I'm going to become Oyashiro-sama.`
` I'm going to become something more than human.`
` Hee hee!`
` You'll never understand how I feel. `
`You'll never understand how wonderful it is to become a god!"`
`".......Ahahaha.`
` I don't think that's possible.`
` No matter how much you try to become Oyashiro-sama, it won't work.`
` It's just a game for you.`
` You will never become Oyashiro-sama."`
`"I will.`
` The process has already begun."`
`Ahahahahahahahaha.`
`Rena laughed at her.`
` Takano seemed very upset to hear that laugh.`
`"What's so funny...?"`
`"It's impossible.`
`Because...`
` Oyashiro-sama is already here..."`
`Those were Rena's last words.`
`"...Well.`
` It's your turn now, Satoko-chan.`
` ......I don't really care if you live or die.`
` But you're a living research sample.`
` Tokyo has a bounty on capturing you alive.`
`But it's not very much.`
` My share would run out with just a trip to Europe. `
`If I capture you alive, nothing good will happen to you anyway.`
` They'll probably open up your skull and probe through your brain while you're still alive. `
`Besides, I was your friend.`
` I think it might be kinder to shoot you dead right here.`
` Which would you prefer?"`
`"I can't decide that!"`
`Satoko shouted back at her. Her eyes were full of tears.`
`"Let's do a quiz, then.`
` Broccoli or cauliflower,`
` which one is green?"`
`"......It's cau--`
` ...no,`
` it's broccoli."`
`Pow.`
`As soon as I heard that same dull sound, Satoko stopped moving.`
`Takano smiled and said "good girl" to what used to be Satoko.`
`"Heh heh heh... Ahhhahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` This really is such a lovely and beautiful night!`
` Don't you agree?"`
`".........So... you're going to kill me too?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will kill you.`
` The corpse of the queen carrier is the key to this mission.`
` You're going to become an ugly political tool far away in Tokyo.`
` And then, the legend of Onigafuchi will finally come to an end."`
`"......I know... how you're planning to kill me."`
`"Oh, you do...?`
` Let's hear it."`
`I'm not going to say it.`
` But I know.`
`It's Watanagashi...`
`She wants to do the real Watanagashi, using my body.`
`I'm sure she's planning to cut open my stomach and pull out my guts.`
`To do that, she'll make me inhale some chemical to put me to sleep.`
` ...I vaguely remember that part.`
`"I guess you already know.`
` Hee hee.`
` ......Good night, Rika-chan."`
`One of the Dogs approached me with a handkerchief soaked in a chemical substance.`
`".........Wait a minute, Takano."`
`"Everyone's dead, but you're begging for your life?`
` Heh heh heh heh!"`
`"......That's not it.`
` ...If you're going to kill me, do it without putting me to sleep."`
`Takano hadn't expected to hear that.`
`Still, even though she was surprised, she nodded with a slight smile.`
`Hanyuu was also surprised to hear that.`
` It would obviously be a terrible way to die.`
`"What are you thinking?`
` Wouldn't you prefer an easy and painless death?`
` You know it's going to be horrible, right?`
` I'm going to cut open your stomach while you're still alive."`
`"......I don't want to forget about it."`
`Yes.`
` ...I'm doing this so I'll remember. I'm not going to forget about it.`
`"...The picture of you cutting open my stomach will be forever burned into my soul.`
` ...I'm never going to forget that.`
` Next time I see you, I'll remember that you did this to me."`
`"Heh heh heh heh... Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!`
` ...What are you cooking up in your little head?`
` I guess you're smarter than the other kids.`
` At least you'd get to have a chance to scream for your life. `
`I'm not going to let you do that, though."`
`They forced something other than the handkerchief inside of my mouth.`
`It was a gag.`
` With that in, I couldn't close my mouth, leading my saliva to start overflowing.`
`Soon, another van arrived.`
`More Mountain Dogs came out of it.`
`They had probably come to get rid of the bodies.`
`They grabbed the corpses of my friends and stuffed them into body bags.`
`After that, they sprayed a bunch of water on the ground to clean up the blood.`
`They asked Takano how many shots she fired, and started looking around for the bullets.`
`They were erasing all the evidence.`
` By the time the night was over, there'd be no more proof left.`
`They pulled my hands behind my back and bound them with handcuffs.`
` My ankles were tied up too.`
` They also tied my ankles and wrists together.`
` My body was bent like a shrimp, and I was no longer able to walk. `
`My mouth was covered so I couldn't even talk.`
`I couldn't move, talk,`
` or express myself in any other way.`
`They had taken away everything that made me human.`
`...Therefore, I wasn't human anymore.`
`I was just a toy named Rika Furude, a toy to give Takano joy.`
`The car started moving.`
` It seemed like we were going back the way we came, but I didn't care anymore.`
`As the time of my death approached, some of my forgotten memories came back to me.`
`...That's right.`
` I was killed like this so many times.`
`Every time I repeated my life, Takano got pleasure out of killing me.`
`Somebody rubbed my head.`
`Were they trying to comfort me?`
`I shook my head to try and refuse.`
` They laughed at me as I did so...`
`"...............Rika...... ...Rika............"`
`Hanyuu showed up.`
` She couldn't hold back her devastated tears.`
`"...Again... ...It didn't work... ...It didn't work again... ...again... ......again......!"`
`...When I saw Hanyuu's painful tears, I was convinced.`
`I was wrong. Hanyuu is not just a bystander.`
`She's just too scared to face reality, because she can't stand the pain anymore...`
`Hanyuu wants a happy future too.`
`But her hopes were betrayed countless times, and she was hurt far too much...`
`For some reason, seeing her sorrowful expression calmed me down...`
`......Perhaps Hanyuu was crying in my place.`
`".........It's okay, Hanyuu.`
` ......We did what we could.`
` We worked very hard.`
` ...We were getting so close to changing our fate for real.`
` ...It still didn't work out.`
` ...But for some reason... ahahaha. `
`I feel satisfied."`
`I've never fought this hard in my life.`
`I've never learned so many things.`
`Because I can repeat my life endlessly, I've been taking each one for granted.`
`...But everyone else is taking their lives seriously.`
`...I wasn't learning anything because I wasn't doing that.`
`But I finally understand.`
`I learned something from this life, and I put all my effort into it.`
`So...`
` I'm sad that I didn't make it...`
` but I feel satisfied just the same.`
` It's a strange kind of satisfaction.`
`I wonder how many of these memories I can keep.`
`...I get the sense that I'm going to lose my memory of this evening...`
`If that's the case, I will lose my memory of seeing Takano's face.`
`...I've finally found out that Takano is the mastermind.`
`Am I going to repeat the same world again, not knowing the truth?`
`She killed my friends as if she were merely killing some bugs.`
` I don't want to forget that!`
`No matter how hard my death will be, I need to remember Takano's face.`
`"......Hanyuu.`
` I'm not going to give up.`
` I don't care if I can't recall this memory.`
` I'll continue to live my life. `
`I don't care if I can only live in this June, and that eventually I will only be able to go back to the night of Watanagashi.`
` If that's my life, so be it!"`
`"......I'm not going to forget either...`
` If you don't remember, I'll tell you the truth...!"`
`"...Hanyuu.`
` ......I knew it.`
` You acted like an unfeeling bystander, but that's because you were afraid of the pain."`
`".........I...`
` I also want to have a happy future with everyone...`
` ...Uuuuuuu...!!"`
`Hanyuu started to cry like a baby...`
`She's so stupid.`
`...She decided to abandon hope because she didn't want to deal with the sadness that she always felt on this night.`
` ...But she ended up hurt and devastated anyway...`
`Hanyuu, are you happy that this world is ending just like you predicted?`
` I decided not to ask her such an unpleasant question...`
`The car stopped, and two men pulled me out of the vehicle.`
` We had returned to the Furude Shrine.`
`There were several men waiting in front of the offertory box.`
`Nearby, there were countless sharp knives laid out on the ground.`
`They're going to cut open my stomach with those tools and pull out my intestines.`
`They took off all of my clothes.`
`They left the gag inside my mouth and the handcuffs around my wrists.`
`I wasn't embarrassed to be naked in front of them.`
`...Rather, I was just furious`
` that Takano was getting joy out of doing this to me.`
`Don't forget this humiliation.`
`The pain I'm about to experience should be carved into my soul forever.`
`I'm not going to forget this.`
`Everyone worked together, and we finally revealed who was behind it all.`
`If I forget this, my friends' efforts and deaths will have been in vain...`
`I need to stay alive as long as I can, so that I will remember the pain.`
`".........Hanyuu.`
` Don't look away.`
` You have to watch.`
` Remember this forever."`
`"......Au au au...`
` ...Is this really the only way I can help you...?`
` Is this all I can do because I can't touch or talk to anyone?"`
`"That's good enough.`
` If you continue to stare at me, I can endure this pain."`
`Hanyuu nodded and sat right next to me, while continuing to cry.`
`We then looked up at the night sky together.`
`The moon was shining brightly, as if it's taking pity upon me.`
` We also looked at the faces of my murderers.`
`That beautiful moon was gradually stained red.`
`It's getting cold.`
`It's so painful.`
`I'm consumed with the fear of not being able to do anything about this.`
`But Hanyuu is right next to me.`
` That gives me comfort.`
`It's not just Hanyuu, either.`
` ...Everyone is here with me.`
`Everyone is there, watching me, so I can stand this torture.`
`That's why it wasn't painful.`
` I didn't struggle.`
` I didn't care about Takano's crazy laughter.`
`This was such a wonderful world.`
`We didn't overcome this fate,`
` but I have no regrets.`
`Of course, I'm still sad.`
` I'm disappointed.`
`My future was right in front of my eyes.`
`My hand could almost reach it.`
`...Even so,`
` we did what we could.`
` I have to be proud of myself.`
`Keiichi voiced his disagreement.`
`He still felt that we could have done more.`
`We were almost there.`
`We almost defeated this fate.`
`We didn't win, but not because our enemies were strong.`
`We didn't win because we didn't try hard enough.`
`"......But all of you worked so hard together.`
` ...I was watching.`
` I saw the whole thing."`
`"But it wasn't enough.`
` If we'd had a will strong enough to overcome this fate, we should have created a miracle...!"`
`"...That's right...`
` A miracle will happen if everyone believes in it..."`
`"...Satoko, Rika-chama, and everyone else worked so hard..."`
`"I'm sorry...`
` Rika.`
` ...You were brave enough to ask us for help... but I couldn't save you......"`
`Satoko held my shoulder and cried.`
`"......That's true.`
` Everyone worked so hard.`
` But it still didn't work out...`
` Thank you.`
` Thank you all so much.`
` ...I'm going to die again... but I've never felt so good about it. `
`......I've learned so many things in this world."`
`"Rika-chan...`
` I know.`
` ...I know why the miracle didn't happen in this world."`
`Rena spoke gently, but she wasn't smiling at all.`
`"Hey.`
` .........Did everyone...... really believe that we could create a miracle?`
` If you're hoping for a future, but not everyone believes in it... then a miracle won't happen."`
`"What are you saying, Rena?`
` We were united!`
` No one had doubts that we could overcome this fate!`
` Right, Mion?"`
`"Yeah.`
` He's right, Rena.`
` Everyone thought we could overcome it.`
` Everyone believed that we could!"`
`"...That's quite true.`
` Even Rika believed in it.`
` She finally believed that with our help, she could change her destiny..."`
`"I believed in it, too.`
` ...But I think there was someone who didn't believe."`
`"Who is that?"`
`......What? ...Who can it be.........?`
`"...Hey... you."`
`Rena turned to Hanyuu and asked her a question.`
`"Did...... you believe?`
` Did you believe that we could overcome this fate?"`
`"...A......... Au au au."`
`"Even if you can't talk to us or touch us,`
` you can still believe.`
` If you'd believed in us, the miracle would've happened."`
`"......Would something really have changed if I believed...?`
` I'm a powerless existence. I can't do anything...`
` ...All I can do is watch and accept. `
`You're saying... that I could've made a miracle happen, just by believing...?"`
`"Yeah. You could have."`
`Keiichi stated it clearly.`
`He wasn't trying to blame her... he was just stating the truth.`
`"That's right.`
` There were six of us,`
` and there were seven of them.`
` If you'd believed along us, we would have numbered seven souls.`
` The miracle could've happened. `
`You don't make miracles happen by touching something or saying something.`
` You make them happen by believing."`
`"......A... ...au au au..."`
`Hanyuu had realized that this ending wasn't caused by fate.`
` ...It was because she didn't believe.`
` In other words, this happened because she was so weak as to accept this fate.`
`She started crying again...`
`"We don't even know your name.`
` ...But you still needed to be brave enough to fight this fear and pain.`
` You needed to have the courage to defeat fate.`
` If you'd believed, we'd be moving on to a bright future. `
`If your refusal to believe in it is the sole reason we couldn't reach it, then the responsibility is yours."`
`It was hard to believe Rena could say something so harsh.`
`Her words were piercing Hanyuu's heart.`
` But those words were necessary for me and for her.`
`Only faith can create a miracle.`
`That sounds like something you might hear in a fairy tale.`
`It's not easy to put it into action.`
`People suspect others.`
` They don't trust others.`
`It's easier to not have hope.`
`It's so difficult to believe.`
` That's why faith can make miracles happen.`
`"...Don't you realize that I can't even touch people?`
` Don't you realize that I can't even speak to them?!`
` You still think I can make a miracle happen... just by believing in something?!"`
`"...Listen... you're talking to me right now.`
` I've never talked to you before.`
` But I always knew you were there.`
` I was always thinking about how I could communicate with you. `
`I always knew you were watching when we were all having fun hanging out together."`
`"B.... But!!`
` Even if I want to be involved, you guys can't see me, or hear my voice...!!`
` You'll think that I'm a monster or something.`
` I don't want people to think of me as a monster!!"`
`"We'd never think of you that way.`
` If you're with us, you're our friend!!"`
`"Yeah, we wouldn't call our friend a monster!"`
`"It's your heart that determines whether you're a monster or not.`
` Right, Shion?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I guess I'm more like a monster in that sense."`
`"...You won't call me a monster even though I have horns on my head...?"`
`"We won't call you that just because of the way you look.`
` They're actually cute, you know!"`
`"Ahahahaha! Watch out for Rena!`
` She might try and take you home!"`
`I realized then that I was standing with everyone, looking down at my own body.`
`...I see.`
` ...I'm finally dead.`
`I looked at my bloody body by my feet.`
`It upset me that Takano was still enjoying the torture, but the body that remained was nothing but a shell...`
`"Are you okay, Rika-chan?"`
`"......Meep.`
` Don't you think it's a bit strange to ask that question to a dead person?"`
`Everyone smiled wryly.`
`...It's my first time feeling so much love in death.`
`Everyone is already dead.`
`That's why I feel so happy to be dead. To join them.`
`Suddenly, the world got darker... and my body started to sink downward...`
`I could feel myself disappearing...`
`I still had the sensation of my friends' hands on mine.`
`"Let's go,`
` everyone."`
`"Yeah, let's go.`
` You're also one of us.`
` ...Come on, stop crying, and let's go."`
`My vision had gone dark, but somehow I could still see...`
`Rena offered her hand to Hanyuu, and Hanyuu slowly took it.`
`"...Hanyuu.`
` I don't know what sad experiences you had before we met...`
` But I'm sure my friends will accept you."`
`".........Au au au...`
` ...Is it still going to be fun if I'm involved...?`
` Are you sure they'll accept me...?"`
`"Yes.`
` So come along with us."`
`Rena touched Hanyuu's hand.`
`It felt like everyone else laid their hands on top too.`
` ...If only they had hands to do so.`
`Let's go, Hanyuu.`
`Let's accept this sorrow.`
`So we can embrace joy as well.`
`Believe in the bright future that's waiting for us.`
`The miracle will happen.`
` We will obtain it.`
` ...Okay?`
`Yes.`
` Hanyuu said, with a definite nod...`
