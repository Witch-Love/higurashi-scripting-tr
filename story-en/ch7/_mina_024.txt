`"Yeah.`
` She's been missing since the night of Watanagashi..."`
`"Could it be the curse of Oyashiro-sama...?"`
`"It's freaky that this has happened five years in row now..."`
`Hinamizawa is a small village.`
`Rumors spread fast here.`
`Besides, she's Mion Sonozaki.`
` She would've found out about this yesterday even if the police were trying to hide it.`
`My friends were all talking about the mysterious death of Tomitake and the disappearance of Takano.`
`People in this village are very superstitious.`
`No matter what happens, they conclude that everything is the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The past incidents don't matter to me either way.`
`All I'm interested in is the current one.`
`...The culprit of this case will probably kill me, too.`
`Two days have passed since Watanagashi.`
`Today is Tuesday, June 21st, 1983.`
`At the earliest,`
` I'll get killed on the night of the 22nd.`
` That is, tomorrow night.`
`The day of my death is always different.`
`I always end up getting killed, but the day when it happens varies.`
`I guess the culprit has their own reasons for that.`
`There's only one thing I'm sure about.`
`Based on my experiences, I'll live for sure until tomorrow night.`
`After then, I'll have to live with the fear of getting murdered at any moment.`
`...Still, there's no real reason to be afraid.`
`...When I wake up, I'll be in a brand new world again.`
`I can never remember how I'm killed.`
`That's why I'm not that afraid of the killing itself.`
`...I'm just frustrated that my life is about repeating the same things over and over like a broken record...`
`"............"`
`However,`
` at present, I'm frustrated.`
`My classmates just expect that their peaceful days will continue forever.`
`But I couldn't feel that way.`
`I feel frustrated and full of sorrow......`
` as I really don't want to die.`
`".........It's tomorrow night... Are you ready, Rika...?"`
`"...How foolish of you to even ask...`
` ......What makes it look like I am...?"`
`Hanyuu was trying to warn me that I might get killed tomorrow night.`
`As though she already knew it was going to happen for sure.`
`"......You worked very hard, Rika.`
` This life's Watanagashi was the best festival I've ever had.`
` ...Didn't you feel that way too?"`
`It was fun.`
`It really was fun.`
`Satoko had band-aids all over her face, but everyone was there together, and we kicked up a storm.`
`I want this world to continue forever...`
`I can't accept that`
` this world is going to end tomorrow at the earliest, and within one or two weeks at the latest.`
`"...I'm sure your next life will be just as fun."`
`"............So this world is over and done with...?`
` This is such a happy world... but... it's just going to end like that...?"`
`All of my friends are alive and happy.`
`Keiichi doesn't feel alone,`
` and Rena's family is happy too.`
`Mion and Shion are getting along,`
` as well as Shion and Satoko.`
`The issue of Satoko's uncle is resolved, and she's no longer treated coldly by the other villagers.`
`This is the best world I've ever experienced.`
`But this world is`
`...`
`...`
` going to end.`
`"...Rika.`
` You think of yourself as a normal person too often, when we're both special beings.`
` ...Every child wants their birthday party to continue forever.`
` But the party always ends. `
`That's why children always wish for their enjoyable moments to continue for all time.`
` But that doesn't mean they'll grieve over a party that's ended.`
` Once they sleep, another day will come for them. `
`Something wonderful will happen again.`
` No one disappears like Cinderella once the party is over."`
`"......What a way for you to describe my view on life."`
`"You're like a child who's crying because she doesn't want to leave the party.`
` ...But there's no need to feel that sad, is there?`
` There'll be another party again soon. `
`You still hate to go through another death, but it's only like sleeping for a while, isn't it?"`
`"Hanyuu...... don't you want to see what lies beyond June of 1983?"`
`"I would be lying if I said I didn't.`
` But`
` I'm more concerned about you being consumed by that thought and getting hurt because of it.`
` .........You just don't understand. `
`Without you, I'd have to live for such a long time without anyone to talk to,`
` and I'll only be able to stare at the festival without being part of it.`
` No one will be able to see me. `
`No one will be able to hear me or talk to me either.`
` Do you have any idea how miserable and lonely that will be?`
`...But I finally found you, Rika.`
` ...I can't survive without you anymore.`
` But I can't just die like you can, either.`
` I'll have to live alone until the end of time. `
`I'll have to be alone until someone like you shows up again.`
` ...I don't want that.`
` I...`
` I can't stand the thought of it...!"`
`"...Hanyuu......"`
`"Rika... Please take back that heartbreaking promise you made...!`
` I don't want you to give up if this world doesn't work out for you...!!"`
`"...............Hanyuu.`
` ...I'm sorry.`
` I'll have to think about it for a while."`
`I want to do what I can until the end.`
`When that happens, I can decide what to do.`
`If I think there's still some hope, I can go on living,`
` but if I feel desperate enough, I can just give up.`
`It might not ultimately be a bad thing to repeat June of 1983 over and over.`
`Perhaps I might be blessed with another fortunate life someday.`
`Hanyuu nodded with a little satisfaction after hearing that, sensing that my feelings were starting to lean the way she wanted them.`
`"...What's up, Rena?`
` Are you plotting to take Rika-chan home with you?"`
`"Hey, Keiichi-kun...`
` ...Don't you think that Rika-chan seems to be feeling down?"`
`".........I don't know.`
` She might still be tired from doing the dedication dance at the festival."`
`Rika-chan was sitting all by herself, wearing a sad expression.`
`I'd said she might still be tired from the festival, but that wasn't really how it looked...`
`"Satoko-chan is free now, so I thought she'd have a spring in her step,`
` but she's been acting weird since yesterday.`
` I wonder if something's going on...."`
`"...Satoko's issues are all settled now.`
` There shouldn't be anything that's troubling her anymore..."`
`We'd thought Satoko and Rika-chan might not be able to live together if they found a new guardian for Satoko.`
`But that problem is almost solved.`
`Either the Sonozaki family or the Kimiyoshi family will become her guardian.`
`Mayor Kimiyoshi is already Rika's guardian.`
`If the Sonozaki family gets custody, Satoko will officially become Shion's little sister.`
`Anyway, I had no idea why Rika-chan was acting so upset.`
`"I think we should ask her what's going on."`
`"...Hmm.`
` But I don't want her to think that we're insensitive...`
`But I guess you can ask her, I guess."`
`"So you're saying that it's okay for me to be insensitive...?"`
`Rena laughed and stuck her tongue out at me.`
`I walked up to Rika-chan and struck up a conversation.`
`Perhaps something is still troubling Satoko, and we just don't know about it.`
`If that's the case, we need to help her.`
`"You don't look so good...`
` ...Is anything weird going on?"`
`"............`
` Oh, Keiichi......"`
`Rika-chan had been daydreaming, and it took her a while to realize that I was talking to her.`
`"...Do I look upset, or something?"`
`"Kind of.`
` ...Is anything the matter?"`
`It took her a while to answer.`
`...Such a long silence had to mean "yes".`
`"............Keiichi.`
` There's a poem that I want you to listen to.`
` Don't ask me who wrote it.`
` I just want to know what you think."`
`"...All right. Let me hear it, then."`
`Rika-chan closed her eyes and recited a short poem.`
` It went something like this...`
`Everyone has the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to receive.`
`Everyone has the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to fulfill.`
`I have the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to compromise.`
`"That's a pretty interesting poem.`
` Did you write it?`
` Oh... I'm not supposed to ask that, huh?"`
`"......No, you're not.`
` What did you think after hearing it?"`
`"Everyone has the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to receive."`
`I understand that.`
`Everyone does have the right to be happy.`
`But that doesn't mean that everyone can receive that happiness.`
`"Everyone has the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to fulfill."`
`...This one is a little harder to understand, but exercising that right probably refers to the process of finding happiness.`
`Everyone has the right to work hard for their happiness.`
`But it's not that easy for that work to bear fruit.`
`"I have the right to be happy.`
`Yet it's so hard to compromise."`
`I guess she's trying to talk about compromising your happiness?`
`There's no limit to human desires.`
`You can never stop wanting more.`
`That's why people need to make compromises on their happiness...`
`...At least, that's how I understand it.`
`If she was trying to say that we should be satisfied with what we have, it sounds like a positive statement...`
`But there's also a negative tone to the way it's presented.`
`"...I think this poem is reflecting the feelings of the writer."`
`"...I think so too.`
` So what else did you think...?"`
`She wouldn't admit it,`
` but I'm sure Rika-chan is the one who made that poem, and it's reflecting on how she's feeling.`
`I'm not that smart, but even I can understand that.`
`"I thought it was a sad poem."`
`"Sad...?"`
`"I understand the first two lines.`
` Everyone has a right to be happy, but not everyone can become happy that easily.`
` I think those lines are describing the difficult parts of our lives. `
`But the last line is different.`
` Making compromises is the same thing as giving up... `
`The writer of this poem has given up on their happiness, compromised with reality, and trying to convince themselves they're happy."`
`"...Trying to convince themselves they're happy, you say?"`
`"With plenty of regrets, too.`
` Everyone can become happy with enough effort, but she thinks that she can't.`
` The poem reflects her hopelessness. It's very sad."`
`"Then, Keiichi.`
` ...What do you think she should do...?"`
`"She shouldn't give up."`
`"...She shouldn't give up?"`
`"The writer of this poem already knows how she can be happy.`
` It's something that she deserves.`
` She's been thinking about how to become happy for a long time."`
`"........."`
`"If she really wants to be happy, she shouldn't give up.`
` Remember, we overcame a desperate situation in only a few days.`
` If we all work together, we can make a miracle happen. `
`You saw it with your own eyes, didn't you?`
` What's troubling you?`
` Talk to me."`
`".........There's something I want to talk to all of you about.`
` ...But if I do that, you won't be able to live in this village anymore. `
`Happiness for me would be to see what's beyond June of 1983, together with all of you.`
` It wouldn't mean anything if I lived beyond this June without you."`
`"We won't be able to live in Hinamizawa anymore...?`
` Why is that?"`
`"......They'll kill you if they find out that I talked to you.`
` That's why I can't say anything."`
`"What do you mean... they'll kill us...?`
` ...Are you being threatened by someone...?!"`
`The word "kill" is not something that most people use casually.`
`I was shocked to hear it coming from her mouth.`
`That's why I couldn't help but raise my voice.`
`"I don't know who's the enemy and who's not.`
` The only thing I know for sure is that someone is going to kill me."`
`"W-Wait, Rika-chan...`
` Talk to me.`
` What the hell is going on...?"`
`Is Teppei threatening her?`
`No, that isn't possible.`
`The police arrested him, and besides that the Sonozaki family told him to never come back to the village.`
`There's no way he could contact Rika-chan in order to threaten her.`
`And even if that somehow was the case, Rika-chan could just talk to Mion and everything would be taken care of.`
`But based on her expression, it seems like this is way deeper than that.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` If I talk, you'll be dragged into this.`
` If I lose you, I have no more reason to survive.`
` I just can't talk to you about this.`
` ...I'm not going to compromise my happiness."`
`"I don't understand what you're trying to say...`
` But you sound just like Satoko did a few days ago..."`
`"Like Satoko...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You're thinking it's better to be patient. You forgot the courage needed to fight.`
` You sound like that.`
` Weren't you the one who told Satoko to be brave over the phone?"`
`My words had clearly hurt Rika-chan's feelings.`
`She bit her lip and went quiet for a moment.`
`".........If I talk to you, you might get killed too."`
`"Well, I don't want that.`
` But if we don't do anything, you're going to get killed, right?`
` We don't want a future without you either, Rika-chan."`
`"......What...?"`
`"You may not want to get us involved, but likewise, we don't want to lose you either.`
` We welcome the struggle.`
` Besides, you know how powerful we can be together. `
`I'm sure we can solve anything if we all work as one."`
`".........Not even our combined strength... can solve this problem..."`
`"You don't want to talk to us because you don't want to drag us into it, right?`
` So what you're saying is that you want to die without telling us anything...?"`
`"........................I guess that's what I'm saying."`
`"Don't think that being patient is the same as being brave.`
` Remember the courage to fight.`
` You can talk to me anytime, once you organize your feelings.`
` We'll help you. You can count on us."`
`"......Thank you..."`
`Rika-chan was wearing a sorrowful smile.`
`I could tell that she appreciated my sympathy.`
`I don't know why, but Rika-chan is troubled by something.`
`It's a matter of life and death for her.`
`She can't even talk to us about it.`
`At the very least, she won't talk to me...`
`"......How was it, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"Is Rika-chan troubled by something?`
` That doesn't happen very often..."`
`".........Satoko.`
` This is going to sound strange... but is there any chance that someone is threatening Rika-chan's life...?"`
`"What?!`
` What in the world are you saying, Keiichi-san...?"`
`"Rika-chama is the village mascot.`
` People worship her. No one would ever try to kill her."`
`"What's this...?`
` What are you guys talking about?!"`
`The more I talked to my friends, the stranger it seemed that someone would try to kill Rika-chan.`
`Everyone was even more confused than I felt...`
`"Rika-chan didn't talk to me about what's troubling her...`
` But I'm sure there's something very serious going on with her.`
` ...If she really trusts us, I'm sure she'll talk to us soon. `
`Let's believe everything she tells us if she opens her heart.`
` Okay...?!"`
`We all looked at each other, and nodded.`
