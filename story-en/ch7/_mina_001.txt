`I felt no gravity in the darkness, and lost all my senses as a result.`
`I banged my head on the floor with a dull thud.`
`Seeing stars behind my eyelids, I curled into a ball while holding my head in pain.`
`"Are you okay?`
` Did you get hurt?"`
`"Rika!!`
` Please say something!"`
`I had no idea why I was in this situation,`
` but as soon as I heard their voices from the top of the cliff, I realized that I must have fallen.`
`Ah, I remember.`
`I was playing behind the shrine with the rest of the club members.`
`I got too excited and started doing something very dangerous...`
` then the tree branch broke...`
`That's how I fell off the cliff.`
`My body started to ache all over.`
`I remembered how I fell, but I still felt strange for some reason.`
`I couldn't remember what I was doing...`
` No... it was more that I couldn't remember who "Rika Furude" was before I fell off the cliff.`
`"Au... Au au au..."`
`I heard Hanyuu's panicked voice.`
`I looked behind me, and saw Hanyuu standing there with a scared look on her face.`
`"Hanyuu...?`
`...Ouch...`
` What just...`
` happened...?"`
`"Au au... You were playing with everyone, and fell off the cliff...`
` A-Are you okay...?"`
`"...I don't care about that, Hanyuu.`
` What day is it today?`
` What year and what month is it...?"`
`I always ask this question first when something like this happens.`
`She finally realized that I was asking the same old question.`
`"Umm...`
`...`
`... It's June of 1983.`
` The Watanagashi festival is next week... so..."`
`"Oh dear...`
` I only have that much time left...?"`
`".........This is the best we can do..."`
`Hanyuu muttered regretfully.`
`It was the middle of June, 1983.`
`If this really was the best she could do... I had no choice.`
` I couldn't complain.`
`I gradually started to remember more things.`
`"If this is June of 1983... I see...`
` I was killed again..."`
`After Rena surrendered to the police, all of the classmates were given checkups at the clinic.`
`I didn't get hurt, so I was sent back home after they determined that I had no injuries.`
`.........My memory started getting vague from that point on.`
` A common characteristic of my violent deaths.`
`When my life is taken away violently, the memory before death becomes vague with static.`
`It's like a violently-ripped roll of toilet paper...`
` That example should make it easy to understand, even if it's uncouth.`
`That's why I have no clear memory of what happened and how I died that night.`
`I only have vague memories...`
` I think someone covered my mouth with a handkerchief or something, and I passed out...`
` That's about the only thing that I remember, and only vaguely.`
`I'm not even sure if it really happened...`
`The only thing I know for sure is that I was attacked on my way home or possibly after I got there, and that I was murdered suddenly.`
`I don't know who killed me or how I was killed.`
`I'm glad that at least I don't remember the horrific ending to my life every time it happens.`
`Because of my experiences, I think I now understand why ghosts wander around this world, not knowing that they died so suddenly.`
`If it's a death from a long-lasting illness, people tend to remember that they were sick.`
` They can kind of assume that they died after being sick for a long time.`
`But when your memory is violently disrupted like mine, it can get quite confusing.`
`When I first experienced this, I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or not.`
` I even thought that I hit my head hard and lost my memory.`
`I needed to organize things before I get too confused.`
`My name is Rika Furude.`
`People look at me in a special way,`
` but that's not a big deal for me.`
`All I want is a happy life where I can play around with my best friends.`
`I can't remember how long I've been living just for the sake of obtaining that simple happiness.`
`This panicked girl here is named Hanyuu.`
`I'm the only one who can see her.`
`Perhaps she only exists inside of my head?`
`At any rate, Hanyuu's invisible and can generally only interact with me.`
`It'll be a long story if I try to explain Hanyuu's existence, so I won't be doing that right now.`
`Besides, I don't even know how I should talk about her.`
`She's been there since I was born, and her existence is a natural thing for me.`
`I saw everyone running up the gravel road toward me.`
`They're my important and lovable best friends.`
`Our group's active, boisterous, and we get serious about doing stupid things.`
`I'm never bored when I'm around them, and I love them very much.`
`"Hau... Rika-chan... are you okay?`
` Did you sprain your ankle?"`
`"Where did you get hurt?`
` Let this ol' man have a look at it!"`
`"Meep...`
` Thank you so much.`
` I just got a bump on my head."`
`I think all I got was a bump, at least.`
` My injury wasn't as serious as everyone thought.`
`"When you hit your head, you still need to be cautious, even if you're fine for the moment."`
`"Th-That's true!`
` You should get the Coach to check you out just in case."`
`"That is a good idea!`
`Do you want me to go and get him?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` We'll go ask somebody to use a phone and call him here."`
`"......You don't need to do that.`
` I'm totally fine!`
` Nipah~â˜†"`
`"Absolutely not, Rika!`
` You must be cautious!"`
`Satoko warned me with a stern voice.`
`It really wasn't a big deal, but I decided to nod since Satoko was trying to be generous.`
`She wasn't trying to boss me around or anything.`
`She was only saying that because of how much she cares.`
`I've seen it before in the many different lives that I've been through.`
` I have no doubt that she's really concerned about me.`
`It's not just Satoko.`
`Mion, Rena, and Keiichi are the same.`
`They're all so nice to me, and they truly do care.`
`Mion left to look for a phone.`
`Rena also left with a towel, looking for the water tap.`
`Satoko remained nearby, taking care of me with a worried face.`
`And Hanyuu was just standing there, still wearing a panicked look.`
`Keiichi seemed to be panicked too, but he was trying not to show it.`
`He was standing by me, wearing a calm expression.`
`"Are you all right?"`
`"......I'm fine.`
` It doesn't hurt anywhere."`
`"I'm glad you're not seriously injured.`
` I was super worried!"`
`"............"`
`I wouldn't feel anything special about his words if this was a while ago.`
`But...`
` at that moment when Rena took over the classroom...`
` when she hurt Mion...`
`Keiichi tried his best to save Rena, even so.`
`He was more reliable than I ever imagined from his normal behavior.`
`He's usually an insensitive guy who hurts other people's feelings without noticing, but that's not his true self.`
`He has a secret side. He's willing to sacrifice himself for other people.`
`I was just 'observing' that not too long ago.`
`That's why I can honestly feel his generosity now.`
`Now that I think about it...`
`Keiichi regained a "memory from another world" the previous time around.`
`Is it possible that he carries that memory in this world too...?`
`If that's the case...`
` I have some hope.`
`Hanyuu and I are totally powerless.`
`Hanyuu is only like air to everyone but me, and I'm just a little girl.`
`There's only so much that we can do ourselves.`
`But Keiichi is different.`
`He changed the fate that I had once resigned myself to.`
`He's somebody who may have the power...`
` to take me to my unseen future.`
`If I can get Keiichi to understand me...`
`he could be my hero.`
`Perhaps I'm actually not expecting that much out of him...`
`I just want someone to understand my struggle of being stuck in this maze...`
`"............K-`
` Keiichi..."`
`I spoke to him slowly.`
`It had been a while since I felt so nervous...`
` I hadn't felt this way since I started my endless life in 1983...`
`As a witch, I normally would know what his response would be before even talking to him.`
`I often remain silent because I already know how pitiful the reply would be.`
`But, in that case...`
` why was I so nervous now...?`
`"Huh?`
` ......Did you call me, Rika-chan?"`
`Hanyuu gave me a disappointed look before I responded to Keiichi.`
`"Rika..."`
`I could tell what Hanyuu was thinking, too.`
`...The miracle wasn't going to happen.`
`If miracles do happen, one could've happened many times in my other lives.`
`But I've only seen one miracle before.`
`The miracle that Keiichi gave me was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of miracle...`
`Only if it happened again would it be a true miracle...`
`I won't get out of this world just because I rolled six on the die once.`
`I can't get out unless I get a miracle that's equivalent to getting six on the die ten times in a row...`
`And so, I rolled ten dice wishing that they'd all turn out to be six...`
`"......Keiichi."`
`"What is it?`
` Are you hurt anywhere...?"`
`He looked at me worriedly after I called his name twice.`
`"......Keiichi,`
` do you remember...?"`
`I knew how sudden my question was.`
`As I thought he would, he looked at me with a confused face.`
`"Huh...?`
`What are you talking about...?"`
`"............"`
`I looked inside his eyes to see his true feelings.`
`He should remember... he should know...`
`Even though he doesn't have the memory...`
` Keiichi experienced it...`
`".........?"`
`"What is she referring to, Keiichi-san?`
` Did you do something bad to her?`
` You had better speak up!"`
`............`
`"......Keiichi...`
` Do you remember...`
` climbing up on the school roof...?"`
`"The school roof?`
` Keiichi-san, you climbed up there?"`
`"......I'm not asking you, Satoko.`
` Do you remember, Keiichi...?"`
`"I did?`
` I climbed on the roof?`
` When?"`
`"...................."`
`"You must be mistaken somehow, Rika-chan.`
` I never climbed on the roof, and I don't even know how to get up there."`
`..........Of course you haven't experienced it in this world yet!`
`But please tell me that you remember...!`
`I know you've never been up on the roof, but you should still remember doing it...!`
`You shouldn't be able to remember it, true, but you actually did once...`
`You should be able to remember it once again...!`
`"Perhaps you went up there to get a ball or something?"`
`"Never.`
` Have you been up there, Satoko?"`
`"Unthinkable!`
` I would get in such terrible trouble if I did something like that."`
`"But I bet it'd feel really good to take a nap up there!`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`.............`
`"There's ...no way`
` he would remember..."`
`Guh`
`...................!`
`"If miracles could happen that easily...`
` neither of us`
` ...would be suffering like this..."`
`Shut up...`
`I knew that...`
`I knew that he wouldn't remember...`
`"Our fate is already set in stone. ...We're like a pitiful cicada that dies after the summer festival..."`
`"Shut up..."`
`"Au..."`
`As I stared at her fiercely, Hanyuu realized that she had crossed a line.`
`This might be a waste of time.`
`The maze we're in might not have an exit.`
` It might be an endless loop without a goal in place.`
`We are trapped in this fate...`
`I thought that Keiichi might be able to get me out of here...`
`But that Keiichi I saw was...`
` ...truly a miracle, a momentary glimmer.`
`...The Keiichi of this world doesn't bear that same miracle.`
`All the same...`
` I'm not going to give up...`
`Last time too, I gave up on fighting destiny.`
`I realized Rena was beyond salvation, so I bid her farewell, and forsook that world.`
`But Keiichi fought and broke the cycle of fate.`
`I should've worked harder with that Keiichi in that world.`
`I could have broken this endless cycle together with him...`
`Am I going to repeat this life, waiting for that miracle to happen again...?`
`I can't do that...`
`I don't want to repeat the same life anymore.`
`I'm tired of it.`
`I'm tired of this world, my fate, and everything.`
` I'm tired of getting murdered by destiny...!`
`Keiichi showed me a miracle.`
`I should be able to do the same too.`
`I must fight.`
` I must fight with all my remaining power.`
`I was always fighting.`
`I was fighting when I had more power.`
`But I never made it... How can I expect to win this time...?`
`Still, I must fight.`
`Keiichi taught me that fate can be shattered.`
`I'm going to fight one more time.`
