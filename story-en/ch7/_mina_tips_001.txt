`I'm sorry for leaving you like this.`
`I just need you to understand I'd rather take my own life than be fearful of how many days I have left to live.`
`That's why I'm writing this letter to you.`
`I can't stand the fear of being unable to leave behind a will while my life is prolonged, even as I lose my consciousness.`
`In the end, there's nothing I can leave behind for you.`
`I was unable to leave any of my achievements to this world.`
`I was forgotten before I was dead.`
`I leave this world a humiliated man, knowing that I had no appreciation from anyone.`
`You must do better than me.`
`You must achieve something that your grandfather was never able to achieve.`
`I don't mind what field you choose.`
`You must leave your mark on this world.`
`You must leave behind your achievements.`
`You will eventually die someday.`
`You will eventually turn to ashes.`
` As a human being, that's your inevitable fate.`
`But if you achieve a great success, you will live forever even after you depart.`
`Those who live beyond their deaths are called gods.`
`I wished to become one, but I was unable to do so.`
`So in my place, you must become a god someday.`
