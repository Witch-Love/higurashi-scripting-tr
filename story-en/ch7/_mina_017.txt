`"Excuse me, I have something to say before the meeting starts."`
`They all knew immediately that I was going to say something about Satoko.`
`...I guess they weren't just old for show.`
`"Oh, Keiichi-kun.`
` Today is our final meeting before the festival, so can you bring up your personal issue later?"`
`I ignored him and continued talking.`
`"If you have something to say, just tell me directly. Don't go through Mion or Chie-sensei.`
` I don't like it when people are so indirect.`
` Let's talk face to face."`
`Everyone went quiet.`
`Nobody there wanted to be involved in a conversation about the Houjou family.`
`"Everyone here knows that Satoko Houjou is practically being confined by her uncle and suffering at his hands.`
` Well, I don't care that you're not proactive about helping her. `
`I'm sure that some of you don't want any trouble.`
` ......But we're different.`
` Satoko is our friend.`
` We're fighting as hard as we can to save our friend from danger.`
` However--"`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` We're aware of all that.`
` All we're saying is that you've done enough to the consultation center by now...!"`
`"Is there a problem if we continue our appeal?"`
`"......Of course there is!`
` It's a big problem, too!!"`
`Someone with a stern voice spoke out to me.`
`...Heh heh, I had gotten under their skin.`
`"Then what is the problem? Can you explain it so a child like me can understand?"`
`"The dam conflict ended ages ago!`
` The age of banding together and storming public offices is over!"`
`The subject wasn't even Satoko anymore.`
` All they had to offer was a bunch of excuses.`
`"I'm not asking about your past, and the dam conflict has nothing to do with this!`
` This is my war!!`
` So if you're going to partake in my war, then let's make it clear if you're my enemy or my ally.`
` Which is it?! `
`Are you my allies, or my enemies?!"`
`Mutter mutter mutter mutter!!`
` Listen to the things that come out of this boy's mouth!`
` Young people these days don't know how to be polite!`
`The whole room lit up and started filling with the smell of gunpowder.`
`However, none of my allies let themselves get swept up in the commotion and maintained their harsh stares.`
`Those expressions made me feel as though I had a million supporters behind me.`
`I was standing in front only as their representative. It wasn't my fight alone...`
` This was everyone's fight!`
`Because of that realization, the fierce looks the old people were giving me didn't intimidate me at all.`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` This is not about us being your enemy or not.`
` Our village fought with these officials during the dam conflict.`
` However, I do understand that this has nothing to do with that. `
`The dam conflict is a thing of the past."`
`"I don't care what you thought about that.`
` I'm talking about me, my friends, and Satoko.`
` I never asked you about the dam conflict.`
` Ever thought of getting your ears checked, old man?"`
`"Why, you... How can you talk to your elders like that?!`
` You disrespectful little brat!!`
` I'd like to have a word with your parents!!"`
`My dad, standing behind me, gave an apologetic and bitter smile.`
`"...Pardon me.`
` I'm his father, you see."`
`"You're his father?`
` How could you raise him like this?"`
`"Hahahaha...`
` I guess I'm not a very good parent.`
` ...I'm not sure if I raised Keiichi the way I was supposed to."`
`My dad paused. In the next moment, however, his expression changed to a glare.`
`"However, a single man known as Keiichi Maebara is standing here before all these faces, to voice his appeal that something about this doesn't make any sense.`
` I don't care if he's my son or not. `
`He's only making his assertion, as a man.`
` So I don't think there's really any reason to be talking to me here."`
`Silence filled the room as the old people sat there with their mouths agape.`
`...Ooishi-san broke that silence with laughter.`
`"You've got plenty of pride, don't you?`
` Nfu fu fu fu...!"`
`"...Umm... my name is Rena Ryuugu.`
` Can I ask something?`
`I don't understand the logic of how the dam conflict being over becomes a reason we shouldn't make our appeal to the child consultation center. `
`Would you explain that to us in detail?"`
`Rena's voice remained perfectly level, as though the matter didn't concern her.`
`...However, I could see the fury in her eyes.`
`I was probably the only one who noticed that fury.`
`The old people seemed like they'd rather deal with her than me.`
`"Reina-chan.`
` This village has no reason to fight with the government now that the dam conflict is over.`
` During that time, we did fight them, true.`
` But after the conflict was over, that's water under the bridge. `
`So our village re-established relations with the government.`
` Hinamizawa is not an individual country.`
` We're just a small village in Japan.`
` The government is taking care of us. `
`That's why we need to try and get along with them."`
`"...You're right.`
` It is important for a village to have a good relationship with the government."`
`"Listen to Reina-chan. She understands us, at least."`
`\n"Maebara's boy ought to learn from her!"`
`I heard little bits and pieces from the noise of the crowd.`
`"Yeah, that's definitely true.`
` Hinamizawa has been trying to fix its relationship with the government ever since the dam conflict ended."`
`"Exactly, just like Mion-chan said!"`
`The old men cheered.`
` However, Shion was the next to open her mouth.`
`"That's why the town council and the government officials are best friends now.`
` In fact, two officials always come along on the town council's annual hot spring trip.`
` They get paid to participate too. `
`The trip itself is mostly paid for with tax money, isn't it?`
` Oh, and I know so many other things.`
`Like the donations for the New Year and End of Year parties, as well as the vast financial aid the town council receives for festivities. `
`The upcoming Watanagashi is one of them. The government is putting millions of yen into subsidies and aid.`
` They're the ones who pretty much pay for the whole festival. `
`Ever since the conflict ended, the festival has been getting bigger and bigger.`
` That's because we're receiving money from government officials. `
`So if we get in trouble with them, we might not be able to hold a festival next year.`
` That's why Hinamizawa keeps kissing their asses. Isn't that right, Uncle?"`
`"Sh... Shion-chan...`
` How do you know all of that...?!"`
`"Ahaha... I switch places with my sis sometimes..."`
`"...What the hell.`
` That's a ridiculous story!`
` I still don't understand why you're against what we're trying to do.`
` Rena, will you sum this up for me?`
` What are they saying?"`
`"Well.`
` Basically, they're colluding with the government officials, so they can't risk upsetting them."`
`The whole room went into a panic after Rena summed it up so simply.`
`Some of them were ashamed that we hit the nail on the head,`
` some of them were enraged by our ignorance,`
` and some of them were simply angry about our disrespectful attitudes.`
`All of them combined to throw the room into a chaos of chattering and stomping.`
`"Be quiet! Be quiet!!"`
`They all settled down after Kimiyoshi-san raised his voice.`
`By the time they quieted, the mayor had a terrible look on his face.`
`"Keiichi-kun... The relationship between the town council and the government officials has nothing to do with this.`
` You're just sidestepping the issue yourself.`
` There's no point in mixing the two up together!`
`Listen, we won our battle against the dam project, but we're all labeled as a nest of troublemakers.`
` And yes, we were taking advantage of that image during the conflict. `
`However, now that the conflict is over, that image is working against us badly.`
` We need to try and repair it.`
`Otherwise, this village will have no future.`
` Do you understand?! `
`It's not just about being your enemy! It's much deeper than that!"`
`"In other words...`
` You're saying that if Kei-chan rouses everyone to action, then the friendly atmosphere we've developed will be ruined."`
`The old people nodded as Mion spoke.`
`They were assuming that Mion was on their side.`
`"Mii-chan.`
` What do you mean by the 'friendly atmosphere'?`
` Does that mean that we shouldn't seek help for a poor, innocent girl who's being abused?"`
`"They're trying to say that the child consultation center is doing their job already.`
` So they want us to stop interfering.`
`Given their position, the officials can't say 'leave us alone' that strongly. `
`So they're asking our village to deal with the matter for them, since they're granting us a lot of subsidies."`
`"Oh, so what you're saying is the town council is the government's lap dog."`
`"Hey you! Watch what you're saying!!`
` Be a little more respectful, why don'cha!"`
`"Why don't you watch what you're saying!`
` I hope you're not refusing to help her just because Satoko is the daughter of the Houjou family!"`
`"That's not it!`
` We're not saying anything about Satoko-chan!`
` We're just telling you to take a look at the bigger picture and show some more restraint in your appeals. `
`The child consultation center isn't ignoring you.`
` I'm sure they've taken your huge protest into account.`
`They already understand your point.`
` We're just saying that you're carrying this way too far...!"`
`"...Keiichi-kun.`
` I just saw something really interesting.`
`See, look at what's in that picture frame over there."`
`Rena pointed at the wall,`
` and everyone followed the direction of her finger.`
`There were very many different picture frames all over the walls of the assembly hall.`
`They mostly had to do with the dam conflict, and were usually about glorifying the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
`Rena was pointing at a framed article. Kimiyoshi-san wrote it, way back when he was the leader of the Guardians during the dam conflict.`
`"Look at the middle portion there.`
` \n'......We attempted peaceful negotiation, but the government and their marionette, the president of the electric company, declined. `
`They have trampled on our village's democratic movement and our native land with indescribable atrocities.'"`
`"......Meep.`
` That's what Kimiyoshi wrote for the dam conflict memorial.`
` He wrote the same thing on the monument too."`
`Everyone knew why Rena had brought that up.`
`I could hear them all gulping.`
`"'They attempted to negotiate peacefully with the government and its marionette, the electric company'...`
` What's this?`
` Are you sure they don't mean the Hinamizawa Town Council instead of the electric company? `
`Still, 'marionette' is a difficult term. Do you think the people understand what that means?`
` Could someone explain it to me?"`
`"A marionette is like a puppet.`
` It means that while they're supposed to be an independent organization, they're actually being controlled as though they're dancing on strings."`
`"Oh, that sounds like the perfect word to describe Hinamizawa right now."`
`"...Ahahaha, yeah, that is perfect."`
`"What are you saying?!`
` We're not their marionette! We're just trying to cooperate with them!`
` Calling us a puppet is just splitting hairs!!"`
`"But that's what you just stated.`
` You clearly told us that you want us to stop, not because of Satoko, but for the sake of the village! `
`You said there's an issue because the village needs to maintain a friendly relationship with the government!`
` Don't tell me that you didn't say exactly that!`
` You did say it!!`
` Didn't you?!"`
`"Mm, I heard him.`
` He said it had nothing to do with Satoko-chan."`
`"Mion.`
` I thought there was a saying in this village. Something about how the whole village comes together for one villager?"`
`"'If there's one person coming, two should throw rocks at him.`
` If there are two, four would do so.`
` If there are eight, sixteen would fight back.`
` If there's a thousand, the whole village should stand up and fight.`
`If one person is abused, the whole village is abused.`
` We all work together for that one villager.`
` That's the unity of the Guardians.`
` The unity of the Guardians is stronger than rock.' `
`......That's what their leader said back in the day."`
`".........Ugh..."`
`Mayor Kimiyoshi used to be the head of the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
`He crossed his arms and started to groan.`
`There were many things he wanted to say, but he knew that none of them would make him look good.`
` And so he continued to stay silent.`
`"When I moved here, Mion and Shion told me the valiant story of the dam conflict.`
` But that unity didn't start just a few years ago, when the dam conflict happened. `
`I believe those traditions have been here for over forty years, ever since Japan lost the war!!`
` That's why I really respect those who fostered the unity here since that era, and I find them incredible! `
`And more than anything, I'm impressed by the courage the Onigafuchi Guardians displayed here in this picture frame!!`
`The government tried to pull many dirty tricks to submerge this village under the water.`
` But the Guardians thwarted every one of them!!`
` Because of the efforts of those men, Hinamizawa is still here today! `
`If they hadn't done anything, we'd be at the bottom of a lake right now!`
` So I'm grateful that this village still exists, with its proud unity and beautiful scenery! `
`I'm proud to call myself a resident of Hinamizawa!!"`
`"That's damn right!"`
`Someone shouted.`
`It wasn't one of my friends.`
`It was one of the elderly villagers.`
`"That's why we fight!!`
` We fight because we all live together in this village!!`
` If there's one person coming, two should throw rocks at him.`
` If there are two, four would do so. `
`If there are eight, sixteen would fight back.`
` If there's a thousand, the whole village should stand up and fight.`
` If one person is abused, the whole village is abused.`
` Get together for one villager. `
`That's the unity of the Guardians!!`
` Satoko Houjou is one of us!!`
`You all know how horrible her uncle is.`
` You all know that we can't leave her alone with him for a whole month!!`
` We need to save her from her uncle right this minute!! `
`We need the power of the Guardians one more time!!`
` We need the spirits of the Guardians to reunite again!!!"`
`Rena and Mion applauded, and the applause quickly spread to everyone.`
`I saw smiles creeping across the faces of the old people.`
`However, they quickly wiped away those smiles and started discussing with their neighbors.`
`"Keiichi-kun is right.`
` It's not like Hinamizawa has to obey the government all of the time!"`
`"But the dam conflict is over now...`
` The government officials are taking care of us, too..."`
`"I wasn't aware of that.`
` Are they really supporting us that much?"`
`"Well, on a personal level, I agree with what Maebara's boy is saying..."`
`"I can't approve of how the town council is operating.`
` Keiichi-kun is right.`
` The village can't put pressure on him just because the government is telling us to do so!"`
`"Mr. Mayor.`
` We might not be able to support Keiichi-kun, but I also don't think we have the right to tell him to stop."`
`".........Hmmm."`
`"I don't like this Maebara boy's attitude!`
` He's way too disrespectful!!"`
`"You think you can get away with talking to us like that?"`
`Three scary old guys came up to yell at me.`
`I raised my own voice and yelled right back in their faces.`
`"It's not about my attitude!`
` It's about the soul of this village!`
` Get out of here if you don't have the courage to stand up for one innocent villager!"`
`"H-How dare you speak to me that way!"`
`Thwack!`
`The big old guy smacked me upside the head.`
`"What do you think you're doing?"`
`Thwack!`
`I hit him right back, and the room went into a panic again.`
`Rena approached us.`
`I thought she'd come to stop me, but she suddenly hit the old guy in the head too.`
`"What?!`
` What're you doing?!"`
`"Don't think you can get away with this just because you're a girl!!!"`
`He thwacked Rena upside the head.`
`However, Rena talked back to him with a firm look in her eyes.`
`"If one comes at you, two should fight back.`
` Isn't that the spirit of Hinamizawa?!"`
`"Since you hit Rena-san, four of us need to retaliate.`
` Let me in on this."`
`"Keiichi.`
` Your father's going to fight too!`
` Everything you've said is right.`
` If they're going to try and stop you with violence, I won't turn a blind eye to that!"`
`"......There are three people blocking Keiichi's way.`
` We need six people to fight them."`
`"R-Rika-chama...!!"`
`"I'm impressed to see that courage of yours, Rika-chama!`
` Let me in too!"`
`"...I, too, will be taking his side."`
`Chie-sensei stood up.`
`I thought she had given up under all the pressure.`
`"I was almost going to neglect my student.`
` ...I prioritized myself, even though I thought I'd do anything for them.`
`I'm ashamed to call myself a teacher!"`
`Wearing a fierce expression, she stared at the mayor.`
`That was her answer to the pressure he'd tried to put on her.`
`".........Chie-sensei......"`
`"I think that I overstepped my bounds as an educator.`
` However, what Maebara-kun is doing is the right thing.`
` As an educator, I have to acknowledge the fact that he's doing something right. `
`I can no longer tell him to stop!"`
`"If I have your support, Chie-sensei, then I have nothing to fear!`
` Let me ask you people one more time. `
`Is it more important to stay cozy with the officials than it is to save the life of one poor, innocent villager?!"`
`"...You don't even need to ask them, Kei-chan.`
` This is no ordinary assembly hall.`
` This used to be the headquarters of the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
` The people here were all members of the Guardians once. `
`...Nobody without their spirit would ever come to a place like this."`
`"..........Mion-chan..."`
`"Mr. Mayor.`
` Kei-chan's actions are embodying the spirit of Hinamizawa.`
` The way he's trying to fight without fear is exactly what the Onigafuchi Guardians were doing. `
`I think it's shameful for this town council to tell him to stop.`
` If you're still going to ask him to back off...`
`I'm going to smash all of these pictures on the wall, and set fire to the flag of the Guardians!"`
`"............Nnn..."`
`While the mayor did nothing but moan, somebody else raised his voice.`
`"I'm going to support Maebara-kun.`
` He may be disrespectful, but he has the right spirit!"`
`"I agree!!`
` It's pathetic the way we're colluding with these government officials!"`
`"Keiichi-kun, don't worry about what anyone else thinks! Keep on fighting!`
` Don't give in to the pressure!"`
`The assembly hall instantly filled with a great round of applause.`
`"Maebara-kun, tell us what's going on so far."`
`"Very well.`
` On the day Satoko was kidnapped by her uncle, Chie-sensei visited her house.`
` However, he refused to let Chie see her, and it was obvious that something unusual was going on. `
`Chie-sensei called the child consultation center right after that."`
`"That night, a social worker visited her house.`
` However, they determined that there was no abuse going on, and they put her case on hold. `
`This might be a normal way to handle the situation, but they don't know how dangerous that uncle is.`
`For that reason, the five of us went to the child consultation center to let them know how urgent it was that she be rescued."`
`"They said they'd take that into consideration, but they still didn't take action after that.`
`We thought five of us was not enough, so the next day, we went there along with more than twenty of our classmates."`
`"You took the whole class...?"`
`"Kei-chan gave a very moving speech.`
` He told them that they had to save their friend and not abandon her.`
` If he was here during the dam conflict, I'm sure his charisma could have resolved it a year earlier!"`
`"Ha ha ha, we all know too well how spirited this lad is!"`
`"The consultation center was still not willing to listen to us on the second day.`
` We made almost no progress.`
` All they told us was that they were working on it."`
`"No, Keiichi-kun.`
` You did make progress.`
` They were so intimidated they asked someone from the local government to check on our town council."`
`"The fact that they tried to pressure us to stop meant that what you did was working.`
` You made progress!"`
`I see... I guess you could look at it like that...`
`If they weren't scared of us, they wouldn't have acted that way!`
`"On the third day, we called all our friends and gathered sixty people.`
` This time, we got to meet the head of the office.`
` He listened to us, but he didn't say what their decision would be."`
`"Keiichi-kun, to tell you the truth...`
` at that point, the council had already spoken to the officials and had made our decision to stop you. `
`After the child consultation center confirmed that the whole village wasn't involved in the protest, they decided to just ignore your appeal."`
`"That's what I thought...`
` I could feel that from the way the head of the office treated us.`
` It was obvious that they were just trying to get it over with."`
`"We're planning to go there tomorrow too, but... I wonder if they'll even pretend to listen.`
` They might not even let us in because they think the village is pressuring us to stop..."`
`"Yeah.`
` They think that the village is on their side."`
`"......The village needs to publicly announce that they're supporting Keiichi."`
`"I agree.`
` Otherwise, they definitely won't listen to us again."`
`"We should do that!`
` We should tell them that Hinamizawa is not going to stop Maebara-kun from what he's doing!"`
`".........Hmmmm...`
` Personally, I don't want to complain about Keiichi-kun's actions...`
` ...However, it's complicated when I think about it from the town council's point of view... `
`Even if we tell them that we're not on either side, they'll think that we're on his side.`
` That's tantamount to picking a fight with them.`
`...But I still have to respect the opinion of the council, too...`
` I can't just decide this on my own...`
` ...I need to get approval from all the council members..."`
`"Most of them are here right now."`
`"...So you say, but...`
` Hmm........."`
`"Let's just be honest here.`
` You're afraid that there are some among you who are against saving the daughter of the Houjou family, aren't you?"`
`"..........."`
`The whole room sunk into silence.`
`That was the heart of the matter.`
`"Everyone thinks that the dam conflict is over.`
` You all told us that a few minutes ago.`
` You also think that there's no need to discriminate against the Houjou family, now that everything is said and done. `
`However, you're still afraid of her family."`
`"You're afraid that you'll be badmouthed if you interact with the Houjou family."`
`"Satoko-chan's parents were indeed the leaders of the evacuation supporters... But what crime did Satoko-chan herself commit?"`
`"......Personally, I don't have anything against her...`
` But other people do..."`
`"I don't have anything against her either.`
` The conflict is over, and her parents also passed away..."`
`"I don't hate her either.`
` But I know there are some people who still do, yeah..."`
`"Let me ask you this.`
` If you hate Satoko, please raise your hand.`
` I'm sure no one will.`
` ...Yet you all still believe that interacting with her will make others speak ill of you.`
`However, no one's going to! `
`There is nobody like that!"`
`"No......... That can't be true.`
` There's one person, at least."`
`"Then tell me who it is.`
` Tell me who told you directly that they hate Satoko!"`
`The room fell silent again.`
`It had become obvious that they were all avoiding Satoko because of a huge misunderstanding.`
`"The child consultation center won't do anything, no matter what we do.`
` They're convinced that the town council is on their side. `
`We won't be able to fight until the council makes it clear that they're not supporting them."`
`"......Kimiyoshi.`
` By any chance... do you need approval from someone?"`
`"............Ouch.`
` ...You're right on the money with that one..."`
`The mayor forced out a smile.`
`I had no idea what Rika-chan was talking about, but she must have hit the nail on the head.`
` Who could it be, though?`
`Who was that someone?`
`If I could persuade them, the village would end up supporting us!`
`"Are you talking about`
`...`
`...`
` my hag of a grandmother?"`
`"......The Kimiyoshi family has forgiven the Houjou family.`
` The Furude family has done the same, right?"`
`"......Meep.`
` I'm one of the leaders of the Three Families too."`
`Hinamizawa has three powerful families who make all decisions for the village.`
`That's been a tradition since the time of Onigafuchi Village.`
`...It's kind of an old tradition, but this was a road we couldn't avoid.`
`"So all we need is approval from the Sonozaki family.`
` I've heard that they have the most power among the three..."`
`Everyone knew that, but it was taboo to speak it.`
` It's something only I could say, since I didn't have the ties they did.`
`"...If we can persuade Mii-chan's grandmother, will the town council support us?"`
`".............What do you think, Mion-chan...?"`
`"...I don't want to fight with Granny.`
`But if she's standing between Satoko and safety, I'll have to.`
` I won't be fighting as the next head of the family.`
` I'll be fighting as Satoko's friend."`
`"Kimiyoshi-san.`
` Please promise.`
` If we persuade Mion's grandmother, will we have the council's support?"`
`"Of course.`
` No one would complain if it was the decision of the Three Families!"`
`"Let me get this straight. You're all refusing to help because you're afraid of Mion's grandmother, right?`
` You're all grown adults! Good grief!"`
`"That's what you say...`
` But isn't Oryou-san terrifying...?"`
`"Ahahahaha, that's not true.`
` I know Mii-chan's grandmother very well.`
` Sure, she has a scary side, but she's not that bad.`
` Keiichi-kun is scarier than her when he's angry."`
`"Yeah, and Rena is even scarier than me!`
` All right.`
` I'm going to persuade Mion's grandmother.`
` Support us when we succeed!`
` Actually, don't just quietly support us, either. `
`I'm expecting you guys to take action too!!"`
`"What do you mean by that......?!"`
`"We want the Onigafuchi Guardians to reunite.`
` Are you going to let us kids do all the protesting?"`
`"You want us to protest too...?`
` We can't do that..."`
`"We should do that!`
` We're going to tell those officials that we're going to fight against them.`
` We need to do everything we can!"`
`"If we're going to support Keiichi-kun on behalf of the whole village, we need to make things clear to them.`
` We have to support these kids if we're going to be on their side."`
`"Once we decide to do that, it's no longer just Maebara-kun's fight.`
` It'll be the village's fight too.`
` In that case, you should be our leader, Kimiyoshi-san! `
`There's no way the mayor shouldn't participate in the protest!"`
`"......All right, I got it already!`
`If Oryou-san gives us her approval, I'll act like a man!`
` I'll help Keiichi-kun!`
` Does everyone here agree?"`
`"""Aye!!!"""`
`"But you're not going to help him persuade Oryou-san...?"`
`"Ahahahahah... ugh... fine.`
` I'll come with him to persuade Oryou-san.`
`The way he talks might be too immature for her...`
` She needs someone who can talk like an old person."`
`"I'm sorry for being so disrespectful today.`
` I really have to apologize, everyone."`
`"Don't worry!`
` You said some good things!`
` You broke up the collusion in one fell stroke!`
` Your refusal to cave under pressure is the very pride of Hinamizawa itself!"`
`"I'm sorry for hitting you.`
` I got pretty riled up."`
`"No, that was my fault..."`
`"You did a good job too, Chie-sensei!`
` You're a wonderful teacher!"`
`"...I really didn't know that some people were still bitter toward the Houjou family..."`
`"Probably... Oryou-san is the most bitter of anybody."`
`However, according to Mion, Oryou-san doesn't hate the Houjou family either.`
` Really, the whole thing was ridiculous...!`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` Good for you, Maebara-san.`
` I never thought you'd get the town council on your side."`
`"No, I don't have them on my side just yet.`
` I need to persuade Mion's grandmother first."`
`"Oryou-san is like a dictator around here, but she won't do anything that would make her lose the trust of the villagers. `
`If you've already settled things with the town council, then it'll be hard for the Sonozakis to oppose you alone.`
`You're such a great negotiator. `
`You insulted them at the start, but then you gradually buttered them up!"`
`"I, uh, I did it the way my dad writes articles for his art magazine.`
` That's the same style he uses..."`
`"Hoho?`
` Your father's set a good example for you, huh?`
` He's an artist, isn't he?`
` I'd love to see his work someday."`
`"Well, ha ha ha ha......"`
`My dad doesn't even let me see his work. I guess he can't show it to him either...`
` What kind of dirty pictures is he drawing?`
`"Well then, let's go and see Oryou-san tomorrow night.`
` We can't go right away.`
` Once she gets into a bad mood, she'll never listen to us..."`
`"I'll be coming along too.`
` Who else is going?"`
`"I'm coming too.`
` Rena-san's also coming.`
` She said she'd cleave her head apart if she doesn't nod it for us."`
`"Hauu... I'm not going to do that!`
` Don't be mean, Shii-chan!"`
`"......I'm going too, Keiichi.`
` I'll talk to Oryou myself."`
`"I see, I see.`
` Give her a piece of your mind!!`
` Of course, I plan to myself, as well!"`
`"I'll try and be there too.`
` I might be able to help just by being around."`
`"This sure is getting interesting.`
` Are you ready to defeat that evil hag, Sis?"`
`"......To be honest, I wish you'd swap with me tomorrow.`
` Ahahaha......"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you've made great progress today."`
`"Yeah.`
` The more people we have on our side, the stronger we become.`
` We can save Satoko if the whole village gets together!`
` This village once won against the national government, after all!"`
`The old people seemed proud to hear me talk about the dam conflict.`
`Everyone started talking about all the heroic things they did back then.`
`"......I thought we could never save Satoko... but that fate is reaching its end...`
` ......The power we have right now is overwhelming. `
`The power to defeat fate is far stronger than the mere chance alignment of a few coincidences..."`
