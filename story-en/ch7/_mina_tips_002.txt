`I was watching TV with Satoko and Hanyuu after eating dinner.`
`It was a variety show, and the performers were making the audience laugh.`
` We were laughing too.`
`"Ho ho ho ho! Look at you now!!"`
`"Au au au... but it looks so painful..."`
`"...Meep. Nipah~â˜†"`
`While the three of us were enjoying ourselves, in reality there was only Satoko and me in the room.`
`I'm the only one who can see Hanyuu.`
`Satoko can't see her at all.`
`Hanyuu responds every time Satoko says anything.`
`Satoko can't hear her, but Hanyuu still responds to her when she's in a good mood.`
`It's like she's answering a question asked on TV.`
`...You could even compare it to playing house.`
`She started playing this game with other people, because she can't communicate with anyone else but me.`
`Hanyuu always attends our club meetings and has a good time there too.`
`...If she could communicate with my other friends, she would've been a good match for us.`
`...But I don't want to hurt her feelings by thinking about that.`
`If the story of the miracle written in the old scriptures is true, if it's really Hanyuu who performed it,`
` she's someone who had tremendous power long ago.`
`But now she doesn't have any spiritual power, and I'm the only one who can even see her.`
`Hanyuu has never told me how she lost her power.`
`I just have to assume that her spiritual power diminished over time...`
`There's a legend in the Furude family that says that Oyashiro-sama will be reborn if a girl is born to the family seven generations in a row.`
`With my birth, Hanyuu was finally able to communicate with a human for the first time in centuries.`
`Does that mean that Oyashiro-sama has returned...?`
`The villagers' image of Oyashiro-sama doesn't quite match up with that of Hanyuu.`
`Especially when I see her lying on her belly and watching TV with Satoko.`
