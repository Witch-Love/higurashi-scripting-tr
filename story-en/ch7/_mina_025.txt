`When I woke up, the first things I saw were Satoko and the calendar.`
`The first one to wake up is supposed to tear yesterday's date off the calendar.`
`Sometimes, we both tear the calendar by mistake, so the date ends up two days ahead.`
`Satoko likes to tear the calendar, and that makes her wake up early every morning.`
`That would usually make me smile, but I felt devastated as soon as I saw the 22 on the calendar.`
`It's going to happen today...`
` June 22nd.`
` The day I die.`
`"......Good morning..."`
`"Good morning, Rika."`
`".........Hm.`
` ...Morning, you two..."`
`"You two??`
` Are you still asleep?"`
`"......Meep.`
` There's someone else living in this house other than you and I.`
` I just said good morning to that person as well."`
`"H-Hey!!`
` Do not try and spook me like that!"`
`"...Hee hee... Satoko won't be able to sleep without holding my hand tonight.`
` ......Hee hee hee hee."`
`Sometimes I feel like Satoko can see Hanyuu, and it's as if the three of us are living together.`
`...That would be a lot of fun.`
`It was time to go to school, but my body felt heavy.`
`Today,`
` I was going to die.`
`Knowing that, I didn't even feel like going to school.`
`The more I've repeated the same life, the more precisely I can detect my day of death.`
`...I always die on the day I feel this way.`
`"Rika.`
` We ought to get going soon."`
`".........`
` I'm`
` taking the day off today."`
`".........Rika...`
` ...I heard from Keiichi-san... Are you troubled by something?"`
`"......Kind of, but not really."`
`".........??"`
`What else is there left to do?`
`Today is the day. It's too late now.`
`But part of me still feels like doing something.`
`I've been in this world only a few days.`
`My emotions went up and down like a rollercoaster.`
` Sometimes I felt motivated to fight,`
` and other times I felt desperate and gave up.`
`Even though Keiichi and everyone else showed me such strength,`
` I lacked the iron will to fight against my fate.`
`The most confidence I ever felt was when the dice all came up six, a fortunate coincidence that was just handed to me.`
`I was hoping to gain the courage to fight against my fate,`
` but here I am today, conceding to destiny.`
`Keiichi told me that we can make a miracle happen if we work together...`
` but there was something he didn't teach me.`
`He didn't teach me how to believe in that.`
`If I don't believe that I can make a miracle happen, I won't be able to make even a crack in the wall of fate.`
`It seems so simple, yet it's so difficult.`
`I couldn't even decide whether I should be on the stage, or stay off it and remain as a spectator.`
`I told Hanyuu that I haven't decided what to do after this world is over.`
`But that's the spectator's point of view.`
`For the people on the stage, this world is the only one.`
`For them, the end of the world means the end of their lives.`
`That's why they'd do anything to change their fate.`
`That's why they can make a miracle happen.`
`I never worked hard enough, because I always knew that I could reset my life.`
`I thought I was just one pathetic girl who couldn't change her own fate.`
`...That's why I ended up here again today.`
`It's as if I slacked off on my summer homework, and woke up on the last day of vacation with nothing completed.`
`What should I do?`
`Should I not work on my assignment, knowing that I'm not going to make it on time anyway?`
`Or should I do whatever I can, even though I may still get in big trouble...?`
`.........Perhaps,`
` a miracle will happen.`
` Perhaps the homework will be done overnight.`
`......Miracles don't happen to homework.`
`I have to do the homework on my own.`
`Without effort, nothing will ever get done.`
`Without effort, not even one question will be solved.`
`"......Rika, I think you should spend your day doing what you want to.`
` You can drink by the window all day, just the way you like doing."`
`"You're suggesting that I shouldn't do anything since I know I'll get in trouble anyway?"`
`For Hanyuu, it's not about the homework. It's more about the vacation itself.`
`The vacation will be over, no matter how much I want it to continue.`
`In her eyes, it's pathetic for me to make a big deal out of not completing my homework,`
` and contemplating whether I should still work on it or not.`
`On top of that, I'm saying that I might as well die if my vacation is going to be over.`
`If I was in her situation, I'd be laughing hysterically.`
`Keiichi told me to seek everyone's help in order to finish my homework.`
`But I'm not taking that offer, not only because I don't want to cause them trouble, but also because I don't want the teacher to know that I got help from them.`
`If I was going to have regrets, I should've worked on it from the beginning.`
`If I had no intention of working on it, I should've just relaxed without stressing so much.`
`If I didn't care what other people thought, I should've asked for their help in the first place.`
`Those are the three options I talked about with Hanyuu yesterday.`
`I didn't choose any of them.`
`I've been living for over a hundred years, but I still can't decide.`
`My hundred years were wasted...`
`"......Satoko.`
` I'm not going to school today, because I have a cold."`
`"I-Is that so?`
` Do you want me to take your temperature?"`
`"......I need to rest today.`
` Could you tell Chie that I'm not coming because I'm sick?"`
`"Rika...`
` Are you really sick?`
` Keiichi-san told me that you're worried someone is trying to kill you... I'm very concerned, you realize?"`
`"......Thank you.`
` You should go now. You'll be late."`
`Satoko looked at the clock, then looked back at me again.`
`"I'm...`
` very happy right now.`
`I'm happy that I'm back with everyone, and that I'm living with you again.`
` .........So...`
` if I lose you... I'll be living in a very sad world... ...Just think about that."`
`".........The world`
` without me."`
`"Yes.`
` ...The world without you... would be a very sad world."`
`I've never thought about that.`
`I thought that the world ended when I died.`
`I've never thought about the world after my death.`
` That was never my concern...`
`"So please... take care of yourself.`
` It isn't just me.`
` ...If anything happens to you, everyone will be sad."`
`"............Satoko..."`
`"Rika...`
` I'll leave you alone for today, but please talk to me if you have something on your mind.`
` It's kind of upsetting how you won't talk to me..."`
`Satoko seemed like she wanted to say more,`
` but she looked at the floor instead.`
`I know what she's trying to say.`
`...I realize how selfishly I've been living.`
`It was wrong for me to look at this world as a stage play.`
`But it's too late...`
` It's too late now.`
`Satoko left the house in a hurry.`
`Hanyuu and I were left alone inside the house.`
`"...I can tell you want to be alone. I'll disappear until you call for me."`
`".........Thank you."`
`"You're still yourself, even after a hundred years.`
` You're not a hundred-year-old transcendent.`
` You deserve to think about your life as a young girl.`
` I don't want to force you to think like a grownup."`
`"It's not your fault, Hanyuu.`
` ...I was just being arrogant."`
`"...Call me if you want to talk."`
`"You're not crying anymore?`
` You're not going to beg me not to give up on my life?"`
`"You're a stubborn person...`
` I know it's better to not be too persistent with you."`
`"Hee hee.`
` ...After all these years, you know me very well."`
`"......I know you're already aware, but let me say this.`
` Today is the day.`
` Do your best."`
`".........."`
`"No matter what you do or don't do, this world is going to end today.`
` But if you wish for it, you'll see a brand new day, just like when morning comes.`
` You might find yourself back in June of this year again... but it'll still be a brand new day."`
`"......When I was younger,`
` every day seemed so boring. Every morning, I thought the same things would happen again after I woke up.`
` ...This just means that'll end up being true."`
`"Let me just tell you to live this day productively.`
` I'm not going to say anything else to you."`
`"I knew today was the day... ......But it's still difficult to hear that from you.`
` ...It's going to come to an end again, huh?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's going to end again.`
` Just like always."`
`Hanyuu disappeared, and it went completely quiet inside the house.`
`How should I spend my day?`
`How should I end this day?`
`Should I work on my homework, knowing that I'm not going to make it on time?`
`I only have half a day left.`
`I have to do my best.`
`I should think about what I can do.`
`This world is supposed to be a happy place.`
`People are enjoying their lives.`
`I should've enjoyed my life more, too.`
`I don't mean in that I should've lived my life in blind optimism.`
`It means that I should've enjoyed my life by fully experiencing both happiness and sadness.`
`If I did that, I wouldn't be as worried about what to do after my death.`
` I should've simply lived with all my might.`
` When the time comes, it'll be over.`
`"...Today,`
` I will live."`
`That's a very important phrase.`
`...But it sounds meaningless when I say it, because I can repeat this meaningless life as many times as I wish...`
`While Satoko was at school, I washed the dishes.`
`Hanyuu would usually stay with me when Satoko wasn't around.`
`But she's not here right now.`
`It's been a while since I was all by myself.`
`I never thought anyone could feel so lonely while washing the dishes.`
`I'm going to die today anyway.`
`This world is ending today.`
`Why should I wash these dishes?`
`......That's because I'm thinking about Satoko, who will have to move on with her life after tomorrow...`
`I will encounter a new Satoko in the next world.`
`But I realized something after hearing what Satoko told me earlier.`
`After I'm dead...`
` I wonder how Satoko will move on with her life.`
`The worlds that I've left in the past all went on without me.`
`I wonder if Satoko will be able to cook without me.`
`I wonder if she can go shopping on her own.`
`I wonder if she can wash her clothes by herself.`
`I've been avoiding thinking about this,`
` but Satoko and my other friends must've been overcome by sadness.`
`It's too late for me to think about this,`
` but I started feeling like I want to cry...`
`I'm feeling like this...`
` because I don't want to leave this world.`
`This is the world that I've always wanted.`
`It's my hope that I can continue to live in this world beyond June 1983.`
`After a long journey, I finally ended up in this world.`
`But I was able to truly live in this ideal world for only one night.`
` The night of Watanagashi...`
`This world will be shattered again after I die tonight.`
`We finally saved Satoko, and all our friends assume that our happy life has returned.`
`However...`
` I'm going to die`
` tonight.`
`They will mourn for me.`
`We worked so hard to make a miracle happen, but they're going to lose their happy world in just one day.`
`Am I going to start a new life in the next world, as if nothing happened...?`
`I'd live three days in my new world,`
` but three sad days were going to pass in this world...`
`...That's no good.`
` ...I can't think straight anymore.`
`I couldn't stop the tears from flowing from my eyes.`
`I hugged Satoko's pillow and cried...`
`I could smell her scent.`
`......After I die, Satoko will probably hug my pillow and cry just like this.`
`Is everyone else going to cry for me too...?`
`I'm sure they will...`
`And...`
` ...And?`
`They'll be sad.`
` Not about my death.`
`They'll be sad, not because I'm dead,`
` but because I never told them about what was troubling me so much.`
`I wonder if they're going to feel regret.`
`Will they wonder what they could've done to open up my heart,`
` what they could've done to help me in my time of trouble?`
` Will they wonder what they could've done to save me...?`
`I felt miserable and frustrated.`
`I held Satoko's pillow and continued to cry...`
`And the next moment, I heard the phone ringing.`
`I tried to ignore it, but it wouldn't stop ringing.`
`...I picked up the phone, hoping that my friends would call to check on me.`
`However, I heard a weird guy's voice coming from the receiver.`
`"Hello.`
` This is Okonogi Gardeners. Is this the Furude residence?"`
`"Okonogi......"`
`It was Okonogi from the Mountain Dogs.`
`...It was the first time I'd received a phone call from him.`
`"I'm calling because I have something urgent to ask you.`
` I called the school, but they told me that you're sick today.`
` Are you feeling alright?"`
`I'm not alright. This is the day I die.`
`I knew he had no idea, but I still couldn't help but feel upset.`
`"......It's only a cold.`
` I just want to rest today."`
`"Really?`
` Well, that's a very fortunate coincidence."`
`"...What?"`
`I had no idea what made him say that he was glad I was sick...`
`"Why is it a fortunate for you if I'm home?"`
`"Well.`
` We got a tip from Tokyo that someone is planning to murder you."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"Tokyo was investigating the murder of Tomitake-san and Takano-san.`
` Their investigation concluded that there's a high possibility Dr. Irie is pulling the strings."`
`".........Irie is behind everything?"`
`This is the first time I've heard something like this.`
`This isn't something that happens at random. It's the very first time.`
`...That means it's not just a coincidence.`
` I'm hearing this now because of something that I did differently in this world.`
`I've done many things differently in this world, though.`
`I can't tell which decision led me to this result.`
`However, maybe this is something that could change my life drastically...`
`Okonogi continued to explain to me.`
`There had been budget cuts to their research, and they were scheduled to be shut down within a few years.`
`Irie was strongly against that, because he was embezzling their research money by requesting bigger and bigger budgets.`
`Because they were going to cancel their research, he tried to sell the research data and make a lot money off of it...`
`"......Is that...`
` really true...?"`
`"I know it's hard to believe, but it is.`
` I always thought that he was kind of suspicious myself."`
`I think I can say with certainty that Irie is not that type of person.`
`I've been around him for years, and as far as I know, he's not a bad guy.`
`He doesn't even have the guts to be one.`
`He pretends to be cold-hearted for the sake of his research, but he can't shake his regrets.`
` ...He's simply a nice person.`
`It's hard to believe that he was embezzling money from Tokyo.`
`...I'm starting to be suspicious of Takano, but she's actually a nice person too.`
`She seemed mean at times, but she could also act as innocent as a child.`
`However, I'm starting to suspect her because Ooishi told me that the body they found in Gifu might not be Takano's body.`
`Okonogi works for Takano.`
`That means I can't trust Okonogi.`
` In other words, I can trust Irie, because Okonogi is clearly just trying to set him up.`
` On the other hand, if Takano isn't guilty, I could be making a huge mistake.`
`Yet, it always seemed to me as though Tomitake and Irie were good friends.`
`If Tokyo had suspected that Irie was embezzling money from them, Tomitake would've treated him far more coldly.`
`Anyway, at the very least, Tomitake of Tokyo didn't have such a bad impression of Irie...`
`......The Irie of the Irie Institute and Tomitake of Tokyo were good friends.`
`...Tomitake of Tokyo and Takano of Tokyo were good friends.`
`...Takano of Tokyo and Okonogi of Tokyo were superior and subordinate.`
`...But Okonogi of Tokyo says that Tokyo`
` is suspicious of Irie.`
`This doesn't make sense.`
`Everyone seems to be good friends at first glance...`
` ...but the links don't connect from start to finish.`
`Irie thinks he has a positive relationship with Tokyo, but Tokyo is suspicious of Irie...?`
`That's just odd.`
`The chain should be connected, but one of the links is twisted out of order.`
` ...It's breaking the loop.`
`"Tokyo is conducting further investigations at the moment.`
` We also have information that Irie is trying to use you as a bargaining chip. For that reason, we've been told to tighten up your security, starting today. `
`That's why I'm glad that you're at home right now.`
` There are twenty security guards patrolling the Furude shrine in three shifts.`
` You may not notice, but they're there for you."`
`"......That's a lot of security.`
` How long are you going to guard me like that...?"`
`"Until Tokyo feels you're no longer in danger.`
` Until this whole case is resolved."`
`That should have been good news for me, since today was the day I was supposed to die.`
`This is exactly the kind of security I wanted. That's why I let Takano into the ritual storehouse.`
`...However,`
` I have a bad feeling about this.`
`Tokyo should be my ally.`
`But that arrangement is just like Irie's relationship with Tokyo--`
` everything seems in order from my end,`
` ...But when you trace it the other way, it feels like something's off at some point.`
`I have this uncomfortable feeling because I have a few uncertainties about Tokyo.`
`Tokyo and Irie have strong ties...`
`but they're suspicious of him?`
`...Is Irie actually a bad guy?`
` ...Is Takano still alive, and is she the one who killed Tomitake?`
` ...Those questions and more made me uncertain about accepting help from Tokyo.`
`I'd thought Tokyo, as a single organization, would move with a single intention.`
`...But in reality...`
` they have multiple, different intentions.`
` In other words, there must be multiple... what's the word...?`
`I see it in the political section of newspapers all the time...`
`...Ah, right. Factions.`
`Are there two factions in Tokyo? One that wants to remain friendly with Irie, and one that looks down on him...?`
`That would explain the irregularities I'm sensing.`
`...Maybe I've been talking to Ooishi too much?`
`If he hadn't told me that he was suspicious of Takano, would I have believed Okonogi without a doubt...?`
`Well, maybe not.`
`Even without Ooishi's theory, Okonogi still sounded very suspicious.`
`Irie was loyal to his research on Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`Tokyo understood this, so his relationship with Tomitake wasn't particularly strained.`
`Plus, Irie isn't the type of person who would commit embezzlement.`
`He's a law-abiding citizen with a good moral character.`
`...Of course he has some ambition as a researcher.`
`But that only goes as far as common sense expects any researcher to. It's nothing like the criminal aspirations that would lead to major embezzlement.`
`A great number of the Mountain Dogs were going to be guarding me.`
`This is what I'd been wanting in my previous lives.`
`But...`
` for some reason, I couldn't be happy about it.`
`I couldn't help but feel depressed.`
`If this house is like an empty birdcage,`
`then they'd be the fox with feathers stuck to its face.`
`I don't know if I can really trust the people who are protecting me.`
`...I tried to recall more about Okonogi.`
`The Mountain Dogs have been protecting me for years.`
`Okonogi proved his skills in many of my other lives.`
`To them, I'm something of a special existence.`
`If something happens to me, it would be a disaster.`
`The Irie Institute is there to keep Hinamizawa Syndrome under control,`
` and the Mountain Dogs are there to protect me from evildoers.`
`So why would they try to betray me now...?`
`......I thought about it for a while, but I had no idea......`
`I just know one thing for sure.`
`I can't feel comfortable with the protection of the Mountain Dogs alone...`
`I want someone other than Tokyo protecting me.`
`...But I bet such a person wouldn't believe me.`
`...Wait...`
` ...what about Ooishi?`
`I've been keeping in touch with Ooishi since the other day.`
`He still thinks that the mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa are all plotted by the village authorities.`
`If he believes that, then he might believe that my life is in danger...`
`For him, I'm a special person with lots of useful information.`
`The Mountain Dogs hate the police, though...`
`When I asked them to assassinate Satoko's uncle, they refused because he was being watched by the police.`
`I would feel relieved if the police were guarding me along with the Mountain Dogs.`
`That way, the Dogs wouldn't be able to harm me, even if they were working for an evil faction of Tokyo.`
`Besides that, if my suspicions toward them turned out to be baseless, more protection couldn't hurt.`
`I'm sure that double security will keep me safe.`
`"......I understand.`
` I'll stay home for today."`
`"Yes, please do.`
` And please don't go out into the city and try to pick a fight with delinquents..."`
`"......Meep.`
` Sorry about that..."`
`"Ha ha ha ha...`
` Anyway,`
` please take care of yourself."`
`"I have a cold, so may I at least go to the clinic...?"`
`"You never know what might happen, so please don't go near there for a while.`
` I don't want them to inject you with anything suspicious."`
`".........Irie would never do anything like that."`
`"That's what we want to believe...`
` But you need to be careful of him until things are cleared up.`
` ......So, I have no choice, huh...?"`
`"No?`
` Hahahahaha...`
` ...You've totally picked up the local dialect, Okonogi."`
`"I used to have a normal Tokyo accent.`
` I like to think I can fix it when asked, though.`
` After all, it's my job to blend in with the local culture."`
`I finished speaking with him.`
`As soon as I hung up the phone, I opened my phone book and looked for the number to the Okinomiya police department.`
`It was nearly noon.`
`...It felt like the pages of the phone book were sticking to my skin.`
` I must have been in a hurry.`
`I really don't want to die...`
`I want to stay in this world.`
`I don't want to leave this perfect world.`
`I'm trying to do something, because I don't want to die.`
`I'm trying to live with all my might.`
`I'm trying to enjoy my life.`
`.........For the first time, I was spending my last day positively, without drinking wine until I was drunk.`
`"Hello, it's Ooishi.`
` Sorry for the wait.`
` I was getting ready to leave for Gifu prefecture.`
` I was going to browbeat them until they owned up to botching the case."`
`"......Gifu.`
` You're talking about Takano's body?"`
`"Yeah.`
` My colleagues are convinced that the body is Takano, but I'm still not satisfied.`
` That's why I'm going there myself.`
` If that body isn't Takano, this is going to be a whole different story. `
`We can put out a search for her as a material witness, see.`
` Fortunately, I have a lots of connections in the Gifu police department.`
` I'll go have a nice, long talk with them.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`It looked like Ooishi was proactively moving forward with the investigation.`
`If that body is really is Takano, that would be sad for her, but it would give me reason to trust the Mountain Dogs.`
`If that's not Takano, then it would tell me that she's part of this whole incident...`
`No matter what the result is, it will give me some kind of hint.`
`But only if I'm still alive...`
`...But really, it's unfortunate...`
`Ooishi is leaving for Gifu.`
` He can't be around to protect me.`
`"......Ooishi.`
` Some stranger called me today.`
` I don't know who it was, but he said he's one of the villagers."`
`"He didn't tell you who he was...?`
` Hmm, I see.`
` Please, go on.`
` What did he tell you?"`
`"He told me that someone is going to kill me.`
` He said they'd kill me tonight at the earliest."`
`"Is that true...?!`
` I see. That's not outside the realm of possibility...`
` Hmmmm!`
` ...I see.`
` I have to leave soon, but I'll send some officers over there.`
` I'll tell them to keep you safe.`
` You're home right now, right? `
`Do you have a cold or something?"`
`"............"`
`"Just stay home and lock your doors and windows.`
` I'll send someone over immediately."`
`"What's wrong, Ooishi-san?`
` You'll be late for your appointment."`
`".......I just got a call from Rika Furude.`
` Someone called to warn her that she was going to be murdered."`
`"Someone is trying kill Rika Furude?!`
` But why?!`
` I thought she was like the village mascot?"`
`"It might be a warning for contacting me about the incidents in the village.`
` I don't know if they're really trying to kill her, but she's just a young girl.`
` I'm sure she's very frightened right about now. `
`Plus, if we lose her trust now, that might hurt our relationship in the future.`
` Two or three officers are enough, but please send them over at once. `
`Also, get a hold of her local officer and have them reassure her some."`
`"Yes sir!!"`
`Rika Furude might have some kind of hint regarding the mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
`Ooishi couldn't let her die.`
`"We should head back to Hinamizawa as soon as we get the Gifu police department to spill the beans.`
` This is going to be a pretty tight schedule for our business trip."`
`"Hahahaha, this'll be a piece of cake!"`
`"This is Skylark.`
` A local police officer is on the shrine property.`
` He's heading toward R's house."`
`"Roger.`
` Continue observation."`
`"Encountering R.`
` She let the officer inside."`
`"R called the Okinomiya police department.`
` She requested protection on her own."`
`"Did she tell them about us...?"`
`"She told them that she got an anonymous call.`
` I'm sure that's made up.`
` The Okinomiya police department is sending a few more officers to her location."`
`"What?`
` Doesn't she trust the Mountain Dogs...?"`
`"This is trouble.`
` it's going to prove more difficult to continue the mission."`
`"...Is it possible... that she somehow found out?`
` Well, we're probably safe.`
` Just tell the team to be aware of the officers.`
` We don't want them to become suspicious of us."`
`"Roger.`
` HQ to all units.`
` There are police officers around the Furude shrine.`
` Please be mindful of them. `
`We may have to postpone tonight's mission..."`
`"I'll call her, but I'm sure the major will order a go anyway.`
` Everything's already set up for R to be discovered dead tomorrow morning so we can move to the next stage.`
` But we don't want the police to suspect us. `
`If they start suspecting you, just leave quietly."`
`Ooishi had called the officers pretty quickly.`
`The officer who was in the area arrived within ten minutes after I spoke with him.`
`He asked me what kind of phone call I received today.`
`...I decided to make up a whole story.`
`It'll all be over if they check my call history, but I'm sure Ooishi won't bother doing anything like that.`
`He thinks I'm worth protecting, because I have information about the incidents in Hinamizawa.`
`The policeman is one of the villagers, so I know him very well.`
`More officers are coming here from the Okinomiya department.`
`The officer told me to relax, because he'd stay with me until then.`
`Ooishi must have thought I was frightened half to death after getting a threatening phone call.`
`After about thirty minutes, four officers in plain clothes arrived at the shrine.`
`The local officer returned to his police box.`
`"We've heard the whole story.`
` We'll guard the shrine, so please call us if something happens.`
` Detective Ooishi will be here this evening."`
`I was relieved to learn that Ooishi would be coming here.`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"At least one person will be downstairs.`
` I'm sorry, but is it okay if we use your restroom?`
` Also, will you give us one of your spare keys, just in case?"`
`"......Sure. You can use the restroom too."`
`My house is on the second floor of a storage building.`
`The first floor contains emergency supplies for the village.`
`I'm happy to know that at least one police officer will be there for me.`
`The officers confirmed their positions on the map of the shrine.`
`One will be in the storage building, and two more will walk around the shrine property.`
`Also, one more officer will be standing in front of the stairs that lead to the shrine.`
`......This world's Ooishi is certainly reliable.`
`In my other lives, Ooishi tended to look at me as his enemy.`
`However, in this world, he thinks I'm on his side.`
`......I'm sure it's because we all became friendly with him around the time we saved Satoko.`
`It was unfortunate at the time, but perhaps the return of Satoko's uncle was a necessary event.`
`If Okonogi was right about Irie, he wouldn't be able to come near me with twenty Mountain Dogs and four police officers protecting me.`
`If Okonogi is the bad guy, they'd be discouraged from acting by the presence of the police.`
`...Not too different from giving garlic to a vampire.`
`This is the best protection I've had in a hundred years.`
`...Even so, am I still going to be killed tonight...?`
`I need to do whatever I can.`
`I should struggle,`
` as hard as possible.`
`I won't give up.`
`I won't even think about my next life.`
`This is what enjoying life is all about.`
` This is what living seriously is all about.`
`"......Hanyuu, are you there?"`
`"...I'm here."`
`"What do you think?`
` About all this."`
`"......I have to admit, I've never seen anything like this before."`
`"Is it still wrong... for me to expect something different this time?"`
`".........I'm not going to hope for anything.`
` I'll just have to accept whatever the result is."`
`Hanyuu is still acting like a bystander.`
`I knew she was going to say something like that,`
` but part of me was hoping she would say something more positive.`
`Upon hearing her say what she did, I felt a little disappointed,`
` and wondered why Hanyuu refused to be anything but an onlooker.`
`I always thought it was normal for her to be that way, because she's a special existence.`
` I also convinced myself I had to be an onlooker too, since I was a similar being.`
`However, I can't just let go of everything and become a bystander.`
`I can't become like her.`
`I can't stop hoping for a better life for Rika Furude.`
`That hope was betrayed so many times, and my heart was crushed countless more.`
`That's why I stopped expecting anything to turn out the way I wanted.`
`So, is Hanyuu the same way...?`
`"......Are you also afraid of being hurt....?"`
`I've only lived for one hundred years, but I know how frightening it is to have high expectations.`
`Hanyuu should also be aware of that, since she's lived far longer than me.`
`I always thought that Hanyuu was a special existence.`
`But, except for the fact that she's invisible, everything about us is the same.`
` She has the same thoughts and feelings as everyone else, yet I still saw her as a special existence.`
`That's why I just assumed that her mind worked in a different way.`
`"I've been living for longer than you.`
` I know that there are more sad things than happy things in this world, and that your hopes will always be betrayed.`
` That's why I don't want to be hurt anymore."`
`"So you're not expecting anything from this world either...?`
` I still have hope that this world might be different...`
`....But you think I'll just be killed again?"`
`"...Au...`
` That's not what I'm thinking..."`
`Hanyuu looked uncomfortable.`
`She had no doubts that I'd be killed again that night.`
`That's what it means to not have hope.`
`But she just can't own up to it, because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings.`
`"You're the same as Satoko..."`
`"..........."`
`"You're waiting for some stroke of luck or some miracle to come and help you.`
` You're afraid of fighting.`
` You think that being patient is the same as being strong. `
`.........That's how I was until just a little while ago."`
`Hanyuu looked down and bit her lip.`
`She couldn't deny what I said.`
`"I know that you've heard it over and over.`
` Miracles will not happen unless everyone works together.`
` That means you have to believe, too.`
` A miracle will never happen unless everyone believes in it."`
`What I just said sounded as though I was blaming her for the miracle not happening.`
`Maybe I was too harsh to her.`
`I stayed quiet, and Hanyuu continued to look at the floor, shaking.`
`Then she looked up at me and spoke.`
`I noticed sadness, but also a little bit of anger in her eyes.`
`"I can't even touch people`
` or talk to them.`
` You think I'm just like everyone else, even though all I can do is watch...?`
` Do you understand how it feels not to be involved in anything...?"`
`There was a slight severity in the tail end of Hanyuu's speech.`
`Except for me, she can't communicate with anyone in this world.`
`She hates to be reminded of that.`
`"............I'm sorry.`
` Let's stop this. I don't want to have a fight with you.`
` I don't want to spend the rest of the time I'm alive in an argument..."`
`"...I don't want to argue with you, either."`
`"But let me just say one thing.`
` You're my friend...`
` I don't want my friend to tell me not to expect too much out of my life."`
`"..........I'll apologize for that.`
` But you should try respecting my opinions, too."`
`She can be very stubborn sometimes.`
`Hanyuu seems weak on the outside,`
` but she actually has a very strong moral code, one that she wouldn't bend for anything.`
`She apologized to me, but she wasn't being honest.`
`She still wasn't expecting anything good to come from this world.`
`She still thinks that I'm going to die pitifully.`
`That's why she refuses to believe in miracles.`
` ......I've been living with her long enough to read her mind...`
`I feel bad for her in a sense.`
` She's been living too long, and lost all of her hope...`
`Hanyuu told me to call her if anything else happened, and soon disappeared.`
`...I'm sure she's still around.`
`She's probably still watching me, as if she's watching a TV show.`
`The time of my death is slowly approaching.`
`Will I be able to survive this time?`
`It's been a long time since I faced this fear without drinking wine......`
