`".........How long are they going to make us wait?"`
`"Those people seem to be free. They should let us talk to them."`
`"Those are just general office workers.`
` We have to talk to the actual social worker responsible for the case."`
`"I wonder if they're busy because they have a lot of cases like this..."`
`"I don't know.`
` ...I wish they didn't have so many issues to deal with."`
`"...This world is tragic. So many kids are being abused."`
`After thirty minutes, they finally called my name.`
`I wrote down my name at the registration, as Mion can't let them know she's from the Sonozaki family.`
`"I'm Maebara... My name was called..."`
`I went to the receptionist to find a uniformed older lady.`
`...She must be one of the office workers Mion mentioned.`
` Was she really going to be the one dealing with us?`
`"Hello, Maebara-san.`
` I see you're here with four other friends... How can I help you today?"`
`The only thing I wrote on the registration was that I wanted to talk about Satoko Houjou.`
`"Well, we're here to talk about Satoko Houjou's case. Chie-sensei from the Hinamizawa Branch School called and made a report yesterday.`
` We would like to discuss the case."`
`"Are you her friends?"`
`"Yes.`
` We're her classmates."`
`"Would you please give me a general summary of what you wish to discuss?"`
`"I heard that you guys put a hold on it because you determined that there wasn't any abuse happening.`
` So we've come here today in order to explain Satoko's situation in more detail..."`
`"I see.`
` Please wait a few more minutes."`
`That was it from her, then.`
`A real social worker should be coming here to talk with us.`
`She was just asking us basic information.`
`With that done, she was talking on the phone and explaining to someone what I just told her.`
`"What did she ask?"`
`"She asked me why I was here.`
` She told me to wait for a few more minutes."`
`"...I hate waiting like this."`
`"......Are those posters and advertisements you've been reading that interesting, Mii?"`
`"I see lots of flyers about abuse...`
` I guess we came to the right place."`
`"'Report the abuse before it escalates'...`
` Check out that slogan, check it out."`
`"There's a bunch of posters with slogans like that in here.`
` I guess that's what the child consultation center is for..."`
`"......Is it any help if it's inside the building, though?"`
`Rika-chan was right...`
`They should be posting them all over the city, not just inside the building.`
`"Maebara-sama.`
` Thank you for waiting.`
` Please go to room number two."`
`"It's our turn now!`
` Let's go!"`
`As we walked, we soon saw rooms numbered one through three.`
`"Hmm...`
` I thought we were going to be talking at the counter, like you do at the bank.`
` But they have individual rooms..."`
`"I guess it's for privacy reasons.`
` Most of the people who come here don't want other people listening to their conversation."`
`"But I think abuse might be increasing because people try to keep the issue quiet."`
`"...People tend not to talk about their family issues."`
`Room number two.`
` It's this one.`
`As I knocked, I heard the voice of a woman telling me to come in.`
`"Hello..."`
`It was a very small room.`
`Well, I should say it was narrow.`
` It wasn't wide, but it was very long.`
`There was a counter in the middle, which split the room into two.`
`The woman was sitting on the other side of the counter.`
` She told us to take a seat, but there were only two chairs...`
`I sat down, since we registered under my name.`
`Mion wouldn't sit because she felt that the Sonozaki sisters shouldn't be in the front.`
`Rena tried to offer the seat to Rika-chan, but she refused, too, so Rena ended up taking it.`
`It was such a tiny room that it was better for us to take a seat.`
` It was very cramped with the five of us.`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We usually expect to see the parents, so we only have two chairs."`
`I understand that.`
`"So, how may I help you today?"`
`"Should I do the talking?`
` Well... we're students from the Hinamizawa Branch School, and we're Satoko Houjou's friends. `
`The school reported that she was being abused to the child consultation center, and I believe that a social worker went to her house last night. `
`We heard that you put a hold on her case. We're here today so we can explain to you how urgent the matter is..."`
`Mion nodded.`
` It seemed like I was doing okay so far.`
`"What are you trying to explain to us?`
` Will you please tell me?"`
`"Well... I know it's only been two days since her uncle took her away, but it's only a matter of time before he starts hurting her. `
`In fact, Satoko suffered terrible abuse at the hands of her uncle last year as well.`
` We believe it's only a matter of time before that happens again. `
`So we would like for you to save Satoko from her uncle before it does.`
` But from what we understand, the child consultation center has decided to wait and see, right?"`
`"Are you going to neglect her?`
` I can't believe that you left her there just because she's not getting physically abused!`
` Who is going to be responsible when she really gets hurt?"`
`Shion probably didn't like how politely I was speaking to her.`
` She was already flaring up with rage at the social worker.`
`It looked like Mion didn't want her to tear into her.`
` However, she let Shion finish, as she'd get even more furious if we tried to stop her.`
`The woman seemed to be used to people losing their temper, and she continued without reacting to Shion's outburst.`
`"I would like to make it clear that we are still working on her case. The results are still pending.`
` We are not abandoning or neglecting her."`
`..."Working on her case".`
` ...They're not abandoning her,`
` they're currently...`
` reviewing options... I suppose?`
`While their mature phrasing made me start to think it might be rude and harsh to say they were abandoning her, Rena quietly opened her mouth.`
`"But you left her there without doing anything last night."`
`No one can ever fool Rena.`
`Taking their time to review options was the exact same thing as abandoning her.`
`The fact is, they left her in that house without taking any actions to prevent her from being abused.`
`"We sent a social worker to her house and they met with her guardian.`
` We cannot talk about the case any further for privacy reasons. However, we are not neglecting her. `
`We are going to look after her and her father so they can have a healthy life together."`
`"He's not her father.`
` He's her uncle.`
` Are you sure you really did an investigation?!"`
`"Excuse me...`
` You're correct. They're uncle and niece.`
` Anyway, we'll be directing them so guardian and child can form a healthy relationship."`
`Shion had pounced on her mistake immediately.`
`I didn't think she needed to be so snappy... but at this point I was starting to understand how different their sense of urgency was from ours.`
`"Well, excuse me, but Satoko was living a happy life before.`
` Without any support from her uncle. `
`First of all, her uncle disappeared from her life for a full year prior, and now he's returned and kidnapped her away.`
` Isn't that a crime?"`
`"It wasn't a kidnapping.`
` It's the law that a child must live where their guardian appoints them to live.`
` According to article 821 of the constitution, the legal guardian of a child is..."`
`"He neglected Satoko for one year!`
` How can he still be considered her guardian?"`
`"Shion...`
` That's what the court decided when her parents died of the curse of Oyashiro-sama..."`
`"Are you serious?`
` That guy is her legal guardian?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I don't know the specific article of law it's written in, but minors must abide by their guardians.`
` In other words, every child has a guardian.`
` They have to have one."`
`"That's article 818 of the civil code."`
`"When Satoko's parents died, her uncle and aunt automatically became her guardians?"`
`"Yes. The closest relative gets custody.`
` It seems her aunt and uncle were Satoko's only relatives...`
` If Satoko and Satoshi refused them, they could've had a different guardian, though..."`
`"But they were the children of the Houjou family, the enemy in the dam conflict.`
` No one was going to take care of them... `
`They were different from Rika-chama. Lots of people wanted to be her guardian, but Father Kimiyoshi got custody of her."`
`"........."`
`I knew that the Houjou family was in favor of the dam project, and the whole village hated her family for that reason.`
`But I thought everything was over after they canceled the project and Satoko's parents died.`
`Was I aware of the difference?`
`The difference between how the villagers treat Satoko and how they treat Rika-chan?`
`The villagers don't abuse Satoko like her uncle.`
`But maybe there were small thorns left in the village, and they were stinging Satoko occasionally...`
`"I can't say this too openly, but Satoko's family had more assets than her uncle's.`
` And by becoming her guardians, they gained control over those assets.`
` That's why they shamelessly took over Satoko's home. `
`Do you know where they used to live?`
` It was this ridiculously tiny place!"`
`"That's horrible...`
` But this guardian neglected Satoko-chan for over a year, right?`
` Can he still claim custody of her?`
` Can he?"`
`"Well...`
` In Part IV, Chapter 4 of the Civil Code, there are provisions for the loss of custody."`
`The woman opened a thick book on the counter and showed us that page.`
`I didn't completely understand what it says on there, but it seemed that a parent can lose custody when they're being irresponsible.`
`"So, the law can take away the right to be someone's guardian..."`
`"Wait a minute... it says something about court...`
` Let me see..."`
`"'At the behest of the child's relatives or a public prosecutor, the family court may make a ruling for the loss of parental authority.'`
` What the heck is this...? `
`So we'd have to sit around and wait for a family court's ruling before he can lose custody?`
` That's too slow!"`
`"Well, if something urgent happens, we can temporarily protect her under our custody.`
` We will also need approval of the family court in that case."`
`"...Here, article 834 for the loss of parental authority, doesn't this apply to Teppei Houjou?`
` It is a fact that the guardian, Teppei Houjou, abandoned his responsibilities as guardian for over a year. `
`What is the center's opinion on that?"`
`"I can't answer for privacy reasons, but the center requested an explanation on that matter as well."`
`"And you accepted his explanation, so you decided to wait and see?"`
`"......Like I've mentioned, we are currently working on this case.`
` The safety of the child is our number one priority, and we will make sure that she will have a healthy lifestyle in a safe environment."`
`We weren't on the same page at all...`
`They just weren't understanding the urgency.`
`...I've never met this Teppei guy.`
`I only know about the situation based on what my friends told me about last year, and what Chie-sensei told us.`
`But I still understood very well.`
`I understood that something really bad was going to happen if we didn't take any action right now!`
`"She was being abused by her uncle and aunt last year too.`
` Are you sure that the same uncle can take care of her?`
` You still have the records from last year, don't you?"`
`"I can't discuss her past record with you for privacy reasons, but we are taking everything into consideration."`
`"She didn't come to school yesterday, and she didn't come today either. `
`He called the school and told them that she has a cold, but don't you think it's a bit odd that she hasn't come to the school since he showed up?"`
`"That's true. But then she really might be sick.`
` I think we should keep our eyes on her and see what happens."`
`"We just know that Satoko doesn't want to be with her uncle.`
` Her uncle is forcing her to stay with him!"`
`"Our social worker spoke with the child, and made their decision after doing so."`
`"So that's it, isn't it?`
` Are you not taking this case seriously because she made a false report long ago?"`
`"I cannot talk about that for privacy reasons.`
` We're taking everything into consideration." `
`"Satoko is telling you that she's not being abused because she feels guilty about her brother, Satoshi.`
` She may have told you that she's not being abused, but I don't believe that statement."`
`"Do you know that people can lose the will to seek help when they have depression?"`
`"Aaagh!`
` Stop making excuses and hurry up and save Satoko!!`
` I'm not going to forgive you people if something happens to her!`
` You'll end up hurt if you don't do something about this while I'm still asking politely!"`
`"Stop it, Shion!`
` You're making us look bad!"`
`"I don't know what her uncle said to the social worker, but he's a violent guy!!`
` Please don't be fooled by him!`
` I just wanted to make that clear!"`
`"So please, speak with her social worker and persuade them to make the call to save Satoko at once.`
` We ask that you do this for us."`
`Some of us were getting emotional, but Mion calmed them down, and Rena summed it up nicely.`
`I stopped speaking to see what she was going to say next.`
`"...Umm, you mean her case worker.`
` I understand your concerns.`
` I will tell them that Satoko-san's friends,`
` three,`
` four,`
` five...`
` five of her friends came here and made an appeal to us. `
`We will continue to work closely on this case, so please let us know when you have further information.`
` Thank you for supporting the child consultation center, `
`and thank you very much for sharing your valuable time with us today."`
`We were still in Okinomiya.`
`We were in the city park, devoid of playing children, staring vacantly up at the madder red sky, in silence.`
`"...I feel like they didn't really listen to our story."`
`"But they also didn't try to kick us out.`
` She's probably just a person who deals with complaints, not the actual social worker that deals with Satoko-chan.`
` That's why she was phrasing everything the way she did."`
`"What did you think about the whole thing, Mion?"`
`"Well......`
` It felt like we were wrestling with a tree.`
` We didn't get pushed or pulled..."`
`"It was the same as talking to a wall...!"`
`"That's not true.`
` She said they will forward our information to the social worker.`
` Like I said, she doesn't know Satoko-chan in person, so she didn't really have any stake in it herself."`
`"So you think we accomplished something today, Rena?"`
`"I don't think it was a waste of time.`
`But I don't think our passion will be understood by the actual person who is working on the case. `
`She'll just tell them that Satoko Houjou's five friends came and requested for them to take her under their custody..."`
`"What about the social worker...?`
` Can't we talk to that person directly?"`
`"I don't know...`
` I heard it's a very tough job...`
` I think it'd be difficult for us to meet him or her in person. `
`Someone even threatened to hurt them if they didn't do anything while she was still asking them politely..."`
`According to Mion, there are lots of problematic clients who show up at the child consultation center.`
` It's not a rare thing for them to get an aggressive visitor like Shion.`
`"It's so difficult to tell them how passionate we are...`
` They might treat us coldly if they took our passion for simple anger..."`
`"I thought you were used to talking with government officials, Mion.`
` Can't you talk to them instead of me?"`
`"It's not that she's good at talking.`
` They just listen to her because she is Mion Sonozaki.`
` You saw how they treated us today...`
`If she announced herself as a Sonozaki, we wouldn't have been in such a small room. We would've been speaking to the manager in a reception room.`
` Right?"`
`Mion gave a vague smile and didn't comment.`
`Mion's greatest weapon is her family name.`
`Without that weapon, she's just as ordinary as the rest of us...`
`I shouldn't be thinking about this...`
` but if the Sonozaki family forgave Satoko's family, it would be really easy for them to save her.`
`"So... the Sonozaki family still hates the Houjou family...?"`
`"No one has publicly stated that we hate them.`
` ......But... it runs pretty deep..."`
`"That hag of a grandmother is the one who hates the Houjou family.`
` Her opinion hasn't changed since we were in the middle of the dam conflict.`
` It's been so many years, but she still can't let go of the past!"`
`"Stop it, Shii-chan.`
` Satoko-chan is Satoko-chan.`
` She's our precious friend!`
` It doesn't matter what her last name is!"`
`Shion went quiet, and there was silence for a while.`
`...Rena was right.`
`Just like how Satoko's last name doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what Mion's last name is, either...`
`The important thing is that our friend is being abused, right now.`
`We'd have to do everything we can to save her from that situation.`
`We all looked up at the sky as we listened to the sound of cars passing by.`
`......We all felt hopeless.`
` We had no idea what to do...`
`Was what we did today going to help Satoko at all?`
`It would've been better if they just kicked us out.`
` That way, we could've been angry with them.`
`But after being treated politely like that, we had no choice but to back off and see what they were going to do.`
`We were forced to just wait and see what happens...`
`Everyone was trying to figure out what our next option was.`
`I couldn't expect Chie-sensei to tell us that everything was taken care of at the board of education...`
` That would be too good to be true...`
`"What shall we do next...?"`
`I muttered to myself, hoping that someone would respond with a good idea... but the silence reminded me that everyone was just as stuck as me...`
`"......Keiichi."`
`"Rika-chan.`
` .........I'm sorry.`
` I was running my mouth off... but I have no idea what to do now..."`
`"......I don't believe this."`
`"What...?"`
`As I looked at her, I realized that the expression on her face was stronger than ever.`
`"You told Shion yesterday...`
` You didn't have a good idea at that moment...`
` but you said you would figure out something. You told her to trust you.`
`So I`
` ......trusted you...`
` I'm not going to believe it...`
` I'm not going to believe that you would even mention that you have no idea...`
` I'm not going to believe that..."`
`I could see tears in her eyes.`
`Rika-chan was sure that I could do something about the situation.`
`"You said it...`
` You said that fate is as fragile as a thin piece of paper.`
` I'm going to believe your words.`
` I still believe you.`
` Because...`
` you can easily defeat fate...`
` So...`
` please help... `
`Help us escape from this fate.`
` Help Satoko...`
` ...help her..."`
`A tear rolled down from the corner of her eye...`
` My heart was feeling the same way.`
`Damn it, damn it, damn it...!!`
`An innocent girl was becoming a prisoner of a tragic fate.`
`She desperately needed help...!`
`I told them that they could trust me.`
`In other words, that they could count on me.`
`That they could bet on me.`
`Betting is not an easy thing.`
`If I lost, they'd lose their coins too.`
`What does it mean to trust someone?`
`It's about making a bet on that person.`
` It's about betting a coin.`
` It's about betting hope.`
`Trusting someone is tantamount to placing your hopes in them...`
`I told Shion yesterday.`
` I told her to trust me.`
`I didn't say it just because.`
`I knew that those words meant something very serious...`
`But now, after betraying Rika-chan and seeing her tears, I finally realized just how serious it is...`
`I look at Shion...`
`She was in a rage again.`
`Mion tried to calm her down, but she didn't have any ideas either.`
`How about Rena...?`
` She's always very reliable in a situation like this...`
`I expected to see her strength...`
`...However... Rena also looked depressed.`
`We didn't even know if what we did was a meaningful thing...`
`Rena looked down with a devastated expression on her face, since she couldn't come up with another option either...`
`Damn it...... I have to do something for them.`
`Rena's blue fire will melt iron.`
`Mion can be strong when the wind is in our favor.`
`Shion is the same way.`
`They will move forward strongly when the wind is backing them up, but they grow weak when the wind is blowing against them.`
`Despite the whole situation...`
` Rika-chan still believes in us...`
`She believes that we can do something if we all come together...`
`That's right. We all agreed.`
`We said to each other that we could make a miracle happen if we all worked together...`
`What am I...?`
`If Rena is the blue fire, I'm the red fire.`
`I burn brightly and give strength to everyone.`
`......That's right... I'm Keiichi Maebara...`
`I'm the magician of words...`
`I have to motivate everyone.`
`The blue fire won't light up unless the red fire does too.`
`When the fire is lit, there will be wind. Mion and Shion will become stronger too!`
`"Thank you...`
` You just made me realize something, Rika-chan......`
` Now the flames inside me are really starting to blaze...!"`
`"Keiichi..."`
`We can't give up now!`
`...We're members of the strongest club ever.`
` Nothing can stop us when we get together!`
`".........I can't become depressed over a small thing like this...`
` Rika-chan woke me up......`
` I just realized how serious it is to have people trust in me."`
`Rika-chan knew our personalities well, and she figured out just who she should motivate first.`
` ...Whoa, I'm really starting to burn up...`
`"Hey Mion!`
` Stop being depressed!`
` This is where we're supposed to get angry, man!"`
`Everyone looked at me with wide eyes as they turned at my powerful voice.`
`They were both surprised by my sudden shout...`
` and waiting in anticipation at the vigor of my call.`
`More and more clearly, I could see it.`
`...This was Keiichi Maebara's role in this club!`
`"I don't think we did anything at the child consultation center.`
` Just like Rena was saying, they're just going to forward a small note saying that the five of us made a visitation. `
`......But being treated like that has lit the fires of our anger...!"`
`"Y-You're right, it feels like they gave us the cold shoulder..."`
`"We were trying to get them to realize how much danger Satoko is in!`
` We have to fight now!`
` We have no time to be sitting all depressed in the park!"`
`"But Keiichi-kun...`
` What are we supposed to do next...?"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` Don't tell me that you think we have no more options left?!`
` If this was a club activity, you guys would be losing right now!`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`...Heh, this is fun!`
`I was feeling depressed too, but now I've got a burning passion in my heart.`
`I felt like I was cheering myself up.`
`Why was I being so sad?`
`If I wanted to save Satoko, I had no time to rest!!`
`This was like the final seconds of the last round in a boxing match where we were at a disadvantage.`
`If I stand here stupefied, I'll lose by indecision. So the only option is to press the attack!!`
`Was I supposed to give up just because I couldn't knock out the opponent with one punch?`
` No!`
` If I couldn't take him out in one, I'd have to throw two or three punches!! `
`I'd have to try until I could finally knock him out!!`
`"You're saying that we're going to go there tomorrow...?"`
`"Close, but not exactly.`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"I...`
` I have no idea what's on your mind... heh heh heh.`
`But it sounds very interesting.`
` ...It isn't like our club to cry ourselves to sleep.`
` We need to turn this headwind around!"`
`Yes! Mion is getting her willpower back too...!`
`"That's right. I agree with Keiichi-kun.`
` I'm ashamed that I was so depressed.`
` Let's fight!"`
`"But what exactly are you trying to do?"`
`"Heh heh heh...`
` Remember everyone...`
` That woman really pissed us off today, but she also told us what our next option is.`
` She never thought she was giving us a hint.`
` She made a huge mistake. `
`......On top of that, that next option is something that I'm really good at...!!"`
