`"I'm still a little worried about sewing needles every once in a while.`
` I don't think about it all the time, of course.`
`It'd be pretty rude if I poked at my food while eating lunch with you guys, wouldn't it?`
` Of course I know that no one would actually put a sewing needle inside of my food."`
`"......But you're still a little scared?"`
`"Well...`
` Maybe I am somewhere inside my heart."`
`"......So.`
` ...You saw a sewing needle...`
` ...inside the ohagi that Mii gave you?"`
`.........`
`"......You saw a sewing needle inside of one?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I did."`
`Inside that ohagi...`
` there was a needle, just as I feared...`
`.........Why was I telling her about something that was just my imagination?`
`Mion and Rena came to see me when I took a day off from school while I was sick.`
`...That never happened, so obviously my brain was just making it up...`
`But I spoke to Rika-chan`
` because she said she wouldn't make fun of me.`
`"......Are you afraid of this ohagi now? Do you feel like there might be a needle inside?`
` Is that why you're not eating it?"`
`I realized that Mion and Rena were also looking at me.`
`They were wondering why I was staring at the ohagi without eating it.`
`"Oh... you don't like ohagi, Kei-chan...?`
` If you don't, you don't have to eat it..."`
`Mion was assuming that I didn't like ohagi.`
`...She felt bad for forcing me to eat something I didn't like.`
`In turn, I felt guilty seeing the sad expression on her face.`
`"Sis, he must be convinced that you put something in it."`
`I immediately denied Shion's remark.`
`...No one else would understand what I'm saying.`
`Even I didn't know.`
`"No, I know for sure that there's no sewing needle inside this ohagi."`
`"A-A sewing needle?`
` Why would this ol' man put something like that in there?"`
`"Aha ha ha... of course you wouldn't.`
` You're not the type to visit and bring something with you out of pure generosity.`
` You might play a trick with tabasco sauce or something, but you'd never put needles inside. `
`You'd never do something as dangerous as that...`
` I know you would never do such a thing."`
`I grabbed the ohagi with my hand.`
`As I brought it in front of my mouth, I felt the need to check it, just in case...`
`...But I told myself clearly.`
`Hey, you wimp!`
`When are you going to stop being scared of that stupid comic book?`
`Mion brought these ohagi to treat everyone in the class.`
`There's no way she'd put needles inside of these!`
`I forced that stupid memory out of my brain and munched on the ohagi.`
`"Mmmm... It's delicious!!"`
`"Of course it is!`
` There wasn't a needle inside, was there?!"`
`"No way.`
` I'm really sorry.`
` I was just caught up in a traumatic experience I once had..."`
`My heart had stopped pounding, and I felt relieved.`
`The next moment, I got the urge to say something to Mion.`
`It wasn't the right thing to say, but I just felt like I had to say it.`
`"Hey, Mion."`
`"Huh? What is it?"`
`"The ohagi was delicious."`
`"Huh?`
`Ahahahahaha. I'm glad I brought them then, even though they were really heavy!"`
`I didn't know why I wanted to tell her again that the ohagi was delicious.`
`But I was glad I said that to her.`
`...I was finally released from that odd feeling.`
`"Well then!`
` Since Kei-chan overcame his fears and ate the ohagi, you should eat this squash, Satoko-chan!`
` Mm, it's so soft and sweet~!"`
`"How can that lunch box always be so full of squash!?`
` You're going to give me a traumatic experience!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Shii-chan is trying so hard to stop Satoko-chan from hating squash!"`
`"She's so passionate about it.`
` Maybe she sees her as her future little sister. Heh heh heh!"`
`By the time I finished eating my ohagi, we had returned to our usual, fun lunch time.`
`"......Keiichi.`
` What if?"`
`"Hm?`
` What if what?"`
`"......What if you really do see a needle inside your food?`
` ...What would you do...?"`
`"That's not going to happen.`
` Don't you threaten me, Rika-chan."`
`"......Keiichi.`
` What if it really happens...?"`
`Rika-chan looked at me with a serious face as I joked around.`
`What's gotten into her lately...?`
`"Stop it.`
` It's not going to happen, and I don't believe it will."`
`I had just overcome my stupid trauma after all that.`
`That's why I made that firm statement.`
`"I understand.`
` ......Keiichi.`
` I'm sorry I'm asking you so much...`
` ...If you see a needle inside your food, it's definitely some kind of mistake...`
` Please don't ever believe that it's Mii's fault."`
`"You're just trying to tell me not to be suspicious of Mion, right?`
` Of course I won't!`
` I would never be suspicious of my friends!"`
`I raised my fist in the air.`
`Rika-chan finally looked happy.`
`She smiled as if she was relieved by my words.`
