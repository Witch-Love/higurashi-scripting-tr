`The items donated for the auction were gathered at the Furude shrine.`
`"There's so much stuff here...!`
` I expected to see towels and old furniture, but there are way more things than that!"`
`"I even see TVs and refrigerators.`
` These are pretty new, too!"`
`"Hahaha! Impressed, huh?`
` We got donations from the stores my family owns. Some of them were display products or leftovers that they can't sell, but they're still practically brand-new.`
`If you don't mind something a model behind, they're incredible, right?!"`
`"Seeing how sun-bleached the 'Brand-New!' sticker on these appliances are makes me feel kind of sorry for them."`
`"No, no, Satoko, that's actually a big selling point.`
` Even if it's a little faded, people feel better using brand-new tools than they do items someone else used."`
`"...Meep. Youngsters these days sure are picky."`
`"Ahahahaha. I don't really care whether it's new or not. All I care about is the price."`
`"Rena-san, you seem interested in furniture.`
` Are you thinking about living on your own, or something?"`
`"Oh, no.`
` My dad and I were just talking about redecorating the house.`
` Brand-new furniture is expensive, so I've been checking out these recycled ones."`
`"You're changing the furniture?`
` That's quite a big deal."`
`"Yup.`
` My dad finally found a job recently.`
`So we kind of want to make a fresh start out of it."`
`"......Your father... found a new job?"`
`Rika-chan asked her. I was thinking the same thing.`
`Did that mean Rena's father was unemployed until recently...?`
`"Yeah.`
` He didn't work for a whole year after he broke up with my mom.`
` I was so upset.`
` I was always telling him to go get a job already."`
`Rena explained that with her usual smile, so it took me a moment to realize how serious it was.`
`If what she said was true, her parents were divorced, and she wasn't living in a very good family environment...`
`Rena talked about it like it was nothing.`
`"Your mother and father broke up...?"`
`"Yup.`
` They got divorced back in the town we were living in before.`
` That's why my dad and I came back to Hinamizawa.`
` My dad couldn't get over the divorce for a long time, though. `
`He was always just sleeping or daydreaming."`
`"Divorces and breakups always wound deeper the more they loved their partner.`
` It's not really a bad thing that your father was hurt so much."`
`"Ahahaha. That's a romantic way to put it.`
` Anyway, I eventually found out that he was spending a lot of money at the bar.`
` I was shocked when I looked at our bank account!"`
`"Rena's mom is a famous designer.`
` Their family used to make lots of money,`
`so her father got lots of settlement money upon the divorce..."`
`"That's why he was able to pay for their living expenses for a while.`
` Perhaps that was why it took him so long to get back on track."`
`"That's true.`
` If he had no money, he would've had no choice but to work.`
` He would've had no time to be depressed if he kept himself busy."`
`"It's tough leaving an ordinary pattern of life.`
` It can really mess up people's cycles.`
`I understand, because I was that way for a while after I left the academy."`
`"......Staying at home like a hermit is the worst thing you can do."`
`"You're exactly right, Rika-chan.`
`That's why I had a talk with him.`
` We talked about his responsibility as the head of the household, and as a parent."`
`"You always look like you're fooling around, but you're actually the most reliable person in this group.`
` I'm impressed that you even spoke to your father like that."`
`"Ahaha. It wasn't a big deal.`
` I was shocked at first.`
`I found out that my dad was spending his money on some lady...`
` As his daughter, it really hurt to find that out..."`
`"......And then?`
` ...What did you do?"`
`"Well...`
` it was no good to think about it on my own.`
` I just kept thinking in a negative way...`
`So I spoke to Mii-chan about it."`
`"All I did was listen to her.`
` Rena was the one who faced her problems and came to the conclusion of talking with her dad about them.`
` I didn't give her any advice."`
`"But that was the important thing.`
` Talking to people about your problems can calm you down a lot."`
`"Hmm...`
` Is that so...?`
` If she overcame it just by talking to Sis, maybe her problem wasn't that serious."`
`"That's not true, Shii-chan.`
`Before I spoke to Mii-chan, all I thought about was how to hurt that lady.`
` But I realized that wasn't a good solution at all.`
`Talking it out with him was the important thing."`
`"So what happened after you spoke with him...?"`
`"Well...`
` We concluded that he wasn't moving on because of the money.`
` So we transferred the funds to a different account, and I took charge of them.`
`Now my dad has to get an allowance from me every month."`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` It's as though you're the parent now!"`
`Everyone else laughed along with Satoko.`
`I wasn't sure if I should laugh,`
` but I saw Rena laughing too.`
`"Anyway, the money was keeping her father from moving on.`
`As soon as he remembered the value of money, he stopped going to that shady bar and got a job."`
`"It really was perfect timing.`
` He was getting ready to pay the down payment for this lady's apartment.`
` That would've been a mess."`
`"You talk about it like it's nothing, but it's a pretty serious story...`
` Your family could've been ruined..."`
`"That's true.`
` If I didn't talk to Mii-chan,`
` and kept on thinking about it on my own...`
` I don't know where I would've been by now...`
`I think...`
` I probably would've tried to kill that lady..."`
`Everyone laughed at hearing such a dangerous thing come out of Rena's mouth.`
`Rena laughed too.`
`But I saw something serious in her eyes...`
`...It was probably true that she once thought about murdering that lady.`
`She seduced Rena's father so that she could get money out of him.`
`Knowing how short-tempered I am, I might do the same if that happened to me.`
`I think she made the right decision in talking to Mion, instead of being irrational.`
`"I'm impressed.`
` It's not that easy to talk about your family issues."`
`"Ahahaha. I know.`
` It took me a while to make the decision to talk to Mii-chan.`
` But that one dream changed everything..."`
`"......A dream?"`
`"Yup.`
` Every night in bed I'd think about my problems...`
` So I was troubled even in my dreams."`
`In my dream, I thought about what would happen to me if I didn't do anything.`
`I don't know if what I saw was my imagination, or a prediction of the future...`
`"In my dream, I saw that lady living with us in our home."`
`My dad and I don't smoke, but there was an ashtray in the living room.`
`The futon in our guest room was now hers.`
`In the bathroom, there was a toothbrush and shampoo I'd never choose to buy.`
`It was an unusual sight...`
`"That must have been a very difficult...`
` and disgusting situation..."`
`Satoko never told me, but I'd heard that she also lost her parents.`
`I'd heard that she went through tough times when she was taken in by her aunt and uncle...`
` Someone told me about that once.`
`Satoko seemed to understand Rena's pain very well.`
`"Yes...`
` It was a really disheartening situation...`
`Eventually, I felt like I didn't belong there anymore...`
` Then something urged me to kill her..."`
`"That sounds so realistic for a dream...`
` What happened after that?"`
`"I realized I was a murderer.`
` I didn't want anybody to find out about it, and I stopped trusting anyone...`
` I spent all day at the place I buried her. `
`I was afraid that if I left that place, someone would find out that I killed her."`
`"That's a nightmare......`
` I'm glad it was just a dream for you..."`
`"I don't know...`
` I wonder if that was just a dream...`
`I think I saw my future... That would've happened if I didn't do anything about the situation.`
`I woke up the next morning shaking in fear. `
`I even felt like I smelled her perfume at home.`
` I wondered when that dream was going to come true...`
` I was so afraid, and that pushed me to talk to Mii-chan."`
`"I remember Rena coming up to me and telling me that she had a secret to tell me.`
` I honestly thought she'd gotten a positive on a pregnancy test for a moment!`
`I can talk about it like this now, but it was very serious then."`
`"Mii-chan is a really dependable person.`
` She listened to me and guided me through a solution.`
` Eventually, we decided that I needed to talk with him face-to-face."`
`"......Perhaps... it wasn't just a dream."`
`"Ahaha, you're right.`
` I think it was more than that."`
`"Without that dream, it's possible that you never would have spoken to Mion.`
` That could've changed your life dramatically."`
`".........`
` A dream, huh."`
`"You've had dreams too, Shion?`
` Huh?"`
`Shion had said something in a small voice.`
`Only Mion picked up on what it was.`
`I don't know what she said, but based on Mion's reaction, she must have said something serious.`
`By the way...`
`Shion usually went to school in Okinomiya.`
` However, she'd been coming to the school in Hinamizawa lately.`
`I didn't know why she chose to come this far,`
` but she seemed to be having fun taking care of Satoko...`
`I had no idea what brought Shion and Satoko together.`
`...Wait, weren't they on bad terms once...? `
`Huh...?`
` Is that true...?`
`Were they always that close, or not...?`
` .........??`
`"Now I know.`
` It's important to talk to other people."`
`We'll have fun in a normal way.`
` We'll laugh together in a normal way.`
` And we'll fall in love in a normal way.`
` We won't doubt each other.`
` We'll trust each other.`
`"Friends have greater meaning than I thought.`
` You can talk to them about anything...`
` I finally came to realize that..."`
`"You're right.`
` ......You resolved not only your family issue, but you also realized the importance of friendship."`
`"Yeah.`
` If anyone is troubled by something, I want to help.`
` I really do.`
` I want everyone to think that they can talk to me about their problems."`
`"......Meep.`
` Rena is saying something very important right now."`
`Rika-chan is right.`
`We all nodded at her, without joking around.`
`A moment later, we heard someone locking the door.`
` We were all surprised.`
`That person didn't mean to lock the door.`
`She must have locked it by accident, not knowing that it was already open.`
`She turned the knob, thinking that it was now unlocked.`
`"Huh?`
` Is anybody inside?"`
`The lady knocked on the door. I could hear several other people outside the door.`
`"Oh, sorry!`
` Let me open it!"`
`Mion replied in a loud voice and walked toward the door.`
`I heard her greeting the ladies from the town council.`
`"Hey, will you guys lend a hand?"`
`"What is it?"`
`I immediately saw why Mion called us over.`
`The people from the village committee had brought another donation.`
` It was an old cupboard.`
`We all helped to carry it inside the room.`
`As I walked through the door, I realized the higurashi were starting to cry, taking over from the cicadas.`
`"I heard you're going to host the auction, Maebara-kun!`
` Everyone thinks you're the best man for that job.`
` We're all looking forward to seeing your showmanship!"`
`"Oh, ah ha ha...!`
` I'll do my best, but please don't expect too much from me..."`
`"Sure, sure you say!`
`You're here today so you can come up with an idea of how to sell these items.`
` They have every reason to expect great things from you!"`
`"I'll make sure I'm at my best then!"`
`The other ladies smiled and told me they were looking forward to it.`
`It hadn't been that long since I moved to this village...`
`But even these people offered me a position of huge responsibility during the festival.`
`So you could say...`
` that they've accepted me as a member of this village.`
`I caused so much trouble where I lived before that I couldn't even go outside,`
` but they're accepting me as a member of the village?`
`I was so happy.`
`I felt bad that I still hadn't learned all of their names,`
` but I was going to do my best to entertain the villagers who were supporting me.`
`"What are you going to do now, Mion-chan?`
` Are you staying here?"`
`"No, we're going home now.`
` Right, Kei-chan?"`
`"Yup.`
` I got a good idea of what we have here.`
` I should be fine now."`
`"I'm not interested in Watanagashi, but I do still want to see his auction.`
` Maybe I'll come to the festival too."`
`"You absolutely must be there, Shion-san!`
` It'll be great fun if we all hang out together."`
`"I disagree!!`
` She lives in Okinomiya, so she should go to the festival there!"`
`"Ahahaha. I think Shii-chan should come.`
` I think Mii-chan will prove entertaining if she does!"`
`"......Since most of us want her to be here, it's decided that Shii is going to come."`
`"You hear that, Sis?`
`You'll be in my shadow on the day of the festival, but let's at least be nice to each other."`
`"Ugh!!`
` I hate you, Shion,`
` I hate you, Shion,`
` I hate you, Shioooon!!"`
`Whatever Mion says, I know that they're actually close.`
`The more Mion tried to refuse her, the more it was obvious how close they really were.`
`"Right, let's go.`
`Make sure you get everything.`
` I'm turning off the light now."`
`We made sure that we didn't leave anything inside and left the room.`
`I looked around the shrine grounds while Mion locked the door.`
`This big place will be filled with people on the day of Watanagashi.`
`"These grounds are going to be the site of the festival!`
` Man, I can't even imagine the crowd.`
` I'm really looking forward to it!"`
`"There's going to be a lot of stalls, and it'll be packed with people.`
` You'll be surprised, I think. I think!"`
`"I wish they'd quit being stingy and hold something every season instead of once a year."`
`"That reminds me, there is someone who visits every season."`
`"Huh?`
` Who are you talking about?"`
`"Oh, I know who you mean.`
` It's that photographer I met the other day, isn't it?`
` What was his name...?"`
`"......You know Tomitake, Keiichi?"`
`"That's right! It was Tomitake-san.`
` I met him on my way back home.`
` Rena and Mion told me about him.`
` Despite his burly frame, he's a fairly modest guy.`
` He comes here every year to take pictures, right?"`
`"That is what he claims, at least.`
` Oh ho ho ho!"`
`"Whenever I see him, I feel like Watanagashi is close by.`
` And after Watanagashi, it's the beginning of summer."`
`"That's true.`
` But the cicadas are already crying because it's gotten hot early this year."`
`"I heard on TV that this year is unusual.`
` It's something to do with a thing called 'global warming'."`
`"I love a hot summer!`
` It's not a proper summer if it's cool."`
`"Yeah, I agree.`
` I like the different climates of the seasons.`
` Cool summers and warm winters disappoint me."`
`"We've gotta be as passionate as the hot summer too!`
` How many of us are going to be there at the festival?`
` It's going to be a battle of The Six Evils!!"`
`"......Once again, we'll have a great Watanagashi this year."`
`"I agree.`
` I hope we'll have lots of fun."`
`"Hey Rena, don't you know?`
` When Rika-chan says something like that, it's not just what she hopes for.`
` It's a prediction.`
` If Rika-chan is telling us that it's going to be great, it really is going to be great. `
`That's our fate!`
` Right, Rika-chan?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's our fate."`
`Rika-chan smiled with a "nipah".`
`Her smile assured me that the day of Watanagashi was going to be a great one for us.`
`"The auction won't be starting right away, will it?"`
`"Nah.`
` It's going to be right before the ritual dance, so we'll have plenty of time to hang out together."`
`"Indeed.`
`It's your first festival. You deserve to have fun."`
`"After Kei-chan's auction, we get to see Rika-chama's ritual dance?`
` Sounds good to me."`
`"......That means I don't get to see Keiichi the whole time... I have to stand by for the dance."`
`"You're going to be in the show too, Rika-chan?`
` What is that dance all about?`
` Are you going to do something traditional because you're the shrine maiden?"`
`"There's a dance and a ceremony for paying respect to the cotton inside the futon.`
` You should root for Rika-chan too, Keiichi-kun.`
`You see, you see...!`
` When Rika-chan dances in her shrine maiden outfit, it's just sho kyuuute!!`
`I'm taking her home with me!"`
`I've never seen a real shrine maiden before...`
`I'm sure Rika-chan really will look adorable.`
`I was looking more and more forward to the Watanagashi festival.`
`Rena, Mion, Shion, Satoko, Rika-chan, and I.`
`The six of us will definitely have a great time there.`
`How many more days did we have?`
`I'd never been this excited about a festival in my life...`
