`...I guess Rika finally managed to assemble all the pieces to her puzzle.`
`But we don't know yet if her memories will pass on to her next life.`
`Rika always loses the memory of her death.`
`I don't know if she can retain the memories of what she's discovered.`
`What did you think?`
` Did you have fun?`
`Once you find out the answers, collecting them isn't so fun anymore...`
`You don't agree...?`
`I see.`
` You still might find something different by examining some old Fragments.`
`After all, the time we have here is endless.`
`We have to find something to play with, because there's nothing to do here.`
`For me, playing with these Fragments stops being fun when I find out what's inside.`
`...But if you can tell me how to have fun with them even so, that makes you pretty smart.`
`What?`
` You want to know what I play with?`
`I don't play. I'm just killing time.`
`I like to imagine what Rika could've done, in order to achieve the future she hopes for.`
`I like to imagine a world that would've been happy for all of them.`
`You've found out how these worlds are set up by looking at the previous ones, right?`
`I like to analyze what would need to change in order for Rika to win against Takano.`
`You want to see what's on my mind?`
`Hee hee, too bad.`
` I'm not showing that to you.`
`In that world,`
` Rika and her friends survived their struggle,`
` and broke through the fate of June 1983.`
`It's just my imagination. It's not for me to share with you...`
`I'm sure the world that Rika is about to create is better than anything in my imagination.`
`Even if she's stuck on June 19th in 1983...`
`I'm sure this now-ended world will remain one of Rika's brightest fragments either way.`
`No matter how much she struggles,`
` if she actually overcomes her fate, it will be the most brilliant Fragment of her story.`
`I'm sure the life Rika lives makes for a better story than my boring imagination.`
`You want to know what happened to Rika...?`
`She made a decision to redo her life once again with Hanyuu.`
`She is trying to live her life with all her might.`
`That's what she learned from this world.`
`Her next life has already begun.`
`I do wonder what that life is like.`
`I'm going there now to check.`
`Do you want to come with me...?`
