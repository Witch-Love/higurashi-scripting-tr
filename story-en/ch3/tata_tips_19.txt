`<Oyashiro-sama>`
`Nobody really knows what characters to use to write 'Oyashiro-sama.'`
`Knowing this is hard partly because depending on the time period,`
` he has been called with various titles, with subtle changes to his name, and nobody knows the real one.`
`The only thing all time periods agree on is that the four syllables "o" "ya" "shi" and "ro" are always used.`
`There is a theory stating the shrine, or "yashiro," dedicated to Oyashiro-sama itself became an object of worship.`
` And that people began calling it "o-yashiro-sama," or "lord honorable shrine"â€”but this doesn't make a bit of sense.`
`I don't know whether this is related, but people say the Furude family, the most respected bloodline in terms of worshiping Oyashiro-sama, actually inherited his blood.`
`And in the legend the Furude family passes down, if for eight generations in a row the firstborn child is a girl, the eighth daughter will be the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`If we go by this legend, the characters used for Oyashiro-sama's name should be "o" for "honorable," "ya" for "eight," and "shiro" for "generation." `
`(These character assignments are simply something I've thought up; there is no way to verify it.)`
`If this is true, then Oyashiro-sama would have been named as such under the assumption he would come again.`
`The second coming of an object of worship can be seen in several religions, so this isn't unusual.`
`But a few of these religions call the second coming of their object of worship a "day of judgment" or something along those lines, and we must not forget they mean it to be the end of the world.`
`Rika Furude, pampered and loved dearly by the elderly folk in the village.`
`...The rumors say she is the eighth generation, and Oyashiro-sama.`
`I do not know the family tree of the Furudes, but at the very least, I can confirm that for the past two generations, the first child has been a girl.`
`Rika Furude watches over Hinamizawa.`
`If the village were to lose her protection, what would happen?`
`Would peace between man and demon be lost?`
`Would it once again create a hellish landscape where man-eating demons run rampant?`
`A gruesome feast of the demons, who suddenly remembered how delicious the weak humans were, who could only cry, scream, and run for their lives.`
`...What would that look like?`
`Just imagining it... is enough to make my heart pound with excitement.`
