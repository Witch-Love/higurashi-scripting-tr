`"Hello?`
` Do you need the hospital or the fire department?"`
`"Err... the fire department!"`
`"Is there a fire, or some other accident?`
` Please speak slowly and calmly."`
`"I-I think it's a fire...`
` This is the _____ rest area on the ____ Highway... I can see a ton of fire and smoke coming up from the mountains behind us. `
`Nobody goes back there, so I don't know why anything got lit on fire...`
` Anyway, I figured I should let you know...!`
` It could turn into a forest fire!"`
`"I understand.`
` I need to know exactly where you are, so please tell me your name, a phone number we can use to get in touch with you, and the exact location of the fire."`
`"Notice from the fire department headquarters.`
` We have a report of a suspicious fire on the western slopes of the _____ Mountain. `
`Given its distance from the road, it could be a couple's bonfire or someone unlawfully burning trash.`
` The location is deep in the woods.`
` No homes in the area, but the fire could spread.`
` Immediately go to the site to verify."`
`"Is this the fire station?`
` This is the ____ District fire department branch.`
` We arrived moments ago at the reported area. `
`Fire confirmed to be a burning oil drum left in the mountains.`
` The fire is calming, and there is no chance it will spread.`
`......And...`
` well......`
` in the oil drum... I think it might be a person.`
` Like, a person burned with kerosene... or something.`
` ...Well... I think maybe we should get the police over here..."`
`"Ah... ah!!`
` T-T-There's no mistaking it!!`
` This is a person!!`
` Eeeeeeek...!!"`
