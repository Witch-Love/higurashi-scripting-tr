`"Morning, Keiichi.`
` ...My.`
` What time did you go to sleep?"`
`I did not sleep well last night at all.`
`My mother could tell from a single glance.`
`...I had the worst dreams.`
`Nightmares, very ominous dreams, one after the other, again and again.`
`I woke up after each one... but could never even remember a fraction of what they had been about.`
`But... it was like those dreams were predicting something unpleasant...`
` and I woke up in a terrible mood.`
`Hey, now...`
`Every day... has been calm and fun before today, right?`
` ...Those days should continue on, unchanging...`
`And yet...`
`Anxiety was the only emotion growing within me.`
` ...Why was that?`
`...Nightmares reflect your own anxiety.`
`...They show an uneasy mind that which you wouldn't admit to normally...`
`...............Yesterday...`
`I remembered the ominous conversations about Satoshi I had... with Shion, Mion, and Rena.`
`...Right.`
`......My mind felt like it was in a black fog... because we had talked about that.`
`If I... If I'd lived every day without causing a fuss, my reward would be ever more peaceful days.`
` ...I understood that... so why did I cause such discord?`
`...But... now that I thought about it calmly...`
`A simple verbal slip on my part couldn't possibly change the world.`
`Yeah.`
`...As long as I'm sorry for doing it, and never talk about it again... there's nothing that anyone can blame me for, right?`
`Besides... how would my fate possibly change... just because I talked about that...?`
`Nothing was going to change.`
`Yeah.`
`Nothing would change.`
`Nothing would change, nothing would change.`
` ...Hahahaha!`
`"That's a creepy smile.`
` If you're still half asleep, then go wash your face."`
`I'd finally cheered up enough to smile, and Mom slapped me right back down—now I was irritated again.`
`There wasn't much time left before I had to meet up with Rena.`
`I frantically started to get ready to go to school.`
`"Have a good day.`
` Watch out for cars!"`
`"There's barely any cars to watch out for!`
` In Hinamizawa, anyway."`
`I dashed out the front door.`
`...The morning air was far more refreshing than the water on my face.`
`That's right, Keiichi Maebara.`
` If you're sorry enough about it and reflect upon your mistakes, that's enough!`
`Now let's pull yourself together and get to school.`
`...And return to fun, enjoyable days.`
`Where everyone laughs, plays, and just has a good time.`
`...I'll be nice to Satoko as an apology, too.`
`...Yeah.`
` Wasn't I supposed to be her Nii-nii until Satoshi got back...?`
`"Good morning!`
` Keiichi-kun!"`
`Rena, too, looked nothing like she had yesterday when she said that weird stuff.`
`...If I could only forget, then I could still act like nothing had happened.`
`...So I called out to her with all the energy I could muster.`
`"Hey!`
` Morning, Rena!`
` Early as usual today!"`
`"Morning!"`
` "Good morning!"`
`There was little time before the same old morning homeroom began...`
` but Satoko and Rika-chan were unusually absent.`
`...Maybe they went to play somewhere?`
`However, looking over and seeing none of their things... so it looked like they really hadn't come to school.`
`"...Hmm?`
` They're almost never late."`
`Rena seemed to be enjoying herself thinking about what their excuse for being late would be.`
`Mion said something nonsensical as well, imagining how funny the reason they were late must have been.`
`...I had only come to school to see their energetic faces, since I figured it would get rid of these feelings I have...`
`But the load on my chest remained where it was.`
` It wasn't very pleasant at all.`
`"Good morning, everyone.`
` President, if you would."`
`"Everybody stand up!"`
`Our teacher finally arrived.`
`...Then, finally, I heard the pitter-patter of footsteps running down the hall.`
`Clatter.`
`...Rika-chan was the first to run through the opened door.`
`...And then, Satoko...`
` .........didn't come.`
`"You're late, Furude-san.`
` ...Where's Houjou-san?"`
`It was unusual for Rika-chan to be late, but equally unusual for Satoko, a ball of energy, to be absent at all.`
`Everyone's eyes were wide at the series of strange events.`
`"...Satoko... might be a little bit late."`
`"Has she come down with something?"`
`The teacher walked over to Rika-chan and they started talking in hushed tones.`
`"Ah-hahahahaha!`
` Rika-chan is late, and Satoko is absent—I guess crazy things can happen."`
` "You're right.`
` But... I wonder what happened to Satoko-chan.`
` ...Is she sick?"`
`...Why now, when I most wanted to see Satoko's energetic face...?`
`...The unease that had been building since last night tightened within my chest.`
`"Kei-chan, you worry too much~!`
` Sometimes girls of her age can't help but stay home sick.`
` Ku-ku-ku-ku!"`
`"Mii-chan, you're not supposed to say that around boys!"`
`Mion laughed indecently.`
`Normally, I would laugh along with her... but right now, I just didn't feel like it.`
`Homeroom ended, and we went to talk to Rika-chan in the short time we had before first period started.`
`"Hey, Rika-chan.`
` You looked so sad, so very sad when getting yelled at for being late~`
` I'll make sure to pet you today."`
`I was very aware of my gloom this morning, so I strove to keep my tone cheerful.`
`I petted Rika-chan's head the same way she always did... but she didn't cheer up at all.`
`"...Meep."`
`"...What happened to Satoko?`
` ...Did she get sick...?"`
`For instance, she got a fever from playing around too much yesterday.`
`...If that had been her response, I would have accepted it in a flash.`
`"............"`
`But the atmosphere around Rika-chan felt somehow heavy.`
` ...It was a little weird, and actually made my unease worse.`
`"Hey, come on, come on~!`
` There's certain things she can't talk to boys about~!`
` Kei-chan, back to your seat, back to your seat~!"`
`Mion, acting just like a club president, pulled me back to my chair.`
`...Rika-chan's gaze immediately fell back to her desk, and she hung her head gloomily...`
`Rika-chan had said something odd... that Satoko might be a little bit late.`
`They were... living together, weren't they?`
`...Then she would have known for sure—she wouldn't have said "might."`
`I didn't understand why she was absent... and that made me all the more anxious.`
`...Damn it, what's going on today?`
`It's like... we started off on the wrong foot, and it wasn't going to get any better.`
`"...What's the matter, Keiichi-kun?`
` You seem pretty down this morning."`
`Rena noticed how I looked and whispered to me while the teacher wasn't looking.`
`"......D-Do I really... seem that way?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Even Rena is starting to feel down just looking at you."`
`I thought of jokingly saying "then don't look at me!"... but I didn't even feel like doing that.`
`"Is it something you can tell Rena?`
` ...I don't know what you're worried about, but if I can help, then you can tell me, okay...?"`
`I won't tease you.`
`Rena said this, looking me straight in the eye.`
`"......Until yesterday... nothing strange had happened, and it was a lot of fun."`
`Huh?`
`Rena's eyes widened for a moment, not understanding what I meant... but she remained silent and listened.`
`"It was peaceful and fun. Every day was lively.`
` ...I never had any doubt things would stay that way forever."`
`"......Yeah.`
` You're right.`
` Every day is fun.`
` I'm sure today will be, too."`
`"...You're sure? How do you know?"`
`"Umm... well.`
`............"`
`Rena, feeling perplexed, couldn't think of something to say.`
`I didn't blame her.`
`...What I was trying to say... seemed a little confusing, even to me.`
`"...When I think about it, I've been anxious lately.`
` ...Like maybe, since every day is fun, one day... all of a sudden...`
` it would get really dark, like a light bulb turned off."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...Rena kind of understands how you feel."`
`Rena nodded gently.`
`"...We've always been taught... that it wouldn't only be good things happening to us.`
`...Sometimes I'm scared of what's going on behind the fun.`
` It's a little bit sad, but...`
` But because of that, we learned how to do our best to make sure that the fun never stops."`
`"...I see."`
`"So it's not a bad thing that you think our fun lives might not go on forever, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Kind of like... Mm.`
` Like if suddenly there was a volcanic eruption tomorrow and everyone died."`
`"Hey, wait... That's terrible!"`
`"If you were the only one who survived the catastrophe, Keiichi-kun... how would you feel?"`
`"...How would I.........hmm..."`
`...I imagined myself being that sole survivor in the ruins of Hinamizawa.`
`...Rubble and the bodies of friends lying in heaps at my feet.`
` ...It was such an abhorrent sight.`
`Was it sadder that all my friends had died?`
`Or was it sadder that I couldn't have died with them?`
`...I didn't know which...... but I'd probably cry a lot.`
`"...It'd probably break my heart.`
` ...First... I think I'd cry."`
`"And then maybe you would think this.`
`If this was my destiny, then I should have made sure every day before this was as fun as possible, so I had no regrets."`
`...I didn't want to consider such a horrible event to be my destiny.`
` ...But...`
` ...............`
`"..................I probably would think that..."`
`"The fun times will end one day, and nobody knows when they will.`
` It makes sense to live each day to the fullest so that if it does happen tomorrow, you don't regret anything."`
`".........Yeah."`
`"It's really hard to think like that.`
` ...A lot of people take their everyday happiness for granted. `
`They think tomorrow will be the same as today, so they leave things they could do today for tomorrow.`
` They leave the kindness they could have shown today until tomorrow."`
`...Rena was usually cheerful and silly, but right now she wasn't like that at all.`
`...She was taking my troubles seriously.`
` ...It was a little reassuring.`
`"But Keiichi-kun, you realized it.`
` ...I think that's a wonderful thing.`
` So that unease you have... I think you should keep it close to your heart."`
`"...Keep my unease... close...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Everyone might die tomorrow in a big catastrophe.`
` ...So you should be really nice to everyone today.`
` ......So when the end really does come... you don't regret it."`
`"...Do you do that, Rena...?`
` Live like you would have no regrets if everyone died tomorrow?"`
`"Yep."`
`...It was such a hyperbolic conversation,`
` but Rena just gave me a nonchalant nod of her head.`
`"...Rena knows... what it's like for the fun times to end overnight.`
` She knows there's no proof tomorrow will be fun, even if today is.`
` ...I'm living...`
` life to the fullest."`
`.........It seemed like Rena perfectly understood all the anxiety I couldn't put into words.`
`...And on top of that... like a reliable teacher, she showed me what to do.`
`...Ooh.`
`......Hey, Keiichi Maebara... There's no need to cry now...`
`"...Last night...... I feel like I had a dream about Satoko.`
` ...I don't remember what kind of dream it was...... but ever since this morning, I've felt... anxious..."`
`"Because... you thought seeing Satoko-chan's energetic face would cheer you up.`
`...Right?"`
`...She was right on the money.`
`If everyone had been here with smiles on their faces this morning,`
` then the murk in my heart would have definitely been blown to smithereens.`
`"...Then... if Satoko-chan arrives, you'll have to be nice to her.`
` Actually, it's totally fine if you play your usual pranks on each other.`
` As long as you're having fun."`
`".........Yeah, you're right."`
`...So that even if these fun days came to an end... I'd have no regrets.`
`I couldn't tell if what Rena told me had been comforting or just made me more anxious.`
`But...... it was enough to make me think that if I saw Satoko again... I'd be honest with her.`
`Lunchtime arrived, with everyone pushing their desks together like always.`
`...Satoko wasn't here.`
`...Despite that, we had bento boxes for five lined up on our desks.`
`...Rika-chan had made a bento for Satoko too.`
`"...Was Satoko supposed to be here before lunch?"`
`".................."`
`Rika-chan was clearly acting strangely.`
`...We were talking to her... but it felt like...`
` she was too far away to hear us.`
`...I'd never seen Rika-chan so downcast.`
`...So... the rest of us started feeling down too.`
`Hey, Rena...`
`I understood what she had said before pretty well.`
`...When we were together, we were supposed to have lots of fun so we wouldn't have any regrets if the world ended tomorrow.`
`......And yet....`
`While I'd just resolved myself to do it, now we can't all be together... What the hell...?`
`...Because... because it was just so sudden, wasn't it?`
`I mean... yesterday was fun, so who could believe... it would all end today?`
`...No volcanoes had erupted, and no earthquakes or fires had happened either!`
`The cicadas were making the same noises they did yesterday, and the sun remained bright in the sky.`
`It was the same normal day as always.`
` ...So then... why...`
`As I pondered, Rena's chopsticks reached in front of my face and stole the fried chicken out of my bento.`
`"If no one else wants it, Rena will take it!`
` Heehee, delicious!"`
`Rena tossed the entire piece into her mouth and began munching on it, her expression one of bliss.`
`"...Tch, I'm such an old man!`
` Rena got a leg up on me!`
` All right!`
` This old man's taking this bit of steak here!"`
`"...Meep! All my food is gone except my rice."`
`Rika-chan, also behind the curve, smiled again and went for someone else's bento.`
`As I sat there, dazed at how quickly everyone had changed...`
` Rena sent a wink over to me.`
`(Come on, Keiichi-kun.`
` Live life to the fullest!`
` That way, if a volcano erupts tomorrow, it'll be okay☆.)`
`"T-This is serious!`
` ...I'll be damned if dried plums and rice are the only things I have left for lunch!`
` I'm taking that meatball!"`
`I stuffed the meat into my mouth and constructed a clumsy smile.`
`I played along, as if trying to fool myself.`
`...But as I did, it rapidly became less and less of an act.`
`Satoko still wasn't here...`
` but at some point, we had regained our lively lunchtime.`
`We had fun,`
` we smiled,`
` and we fooled around.`
`...Thanks, everyone.`
` This was definitely the best thing to do.`
`This way, when Satoko suddenly dropped by, we could welcome her with our best smiles.`
`The more I smiled, the more I felt the anxiety from this morning clearing away.`
`"Wasn't there a proverb that went something like 'fortune comes in by a merry gate'?"`
`"I think so.`
` If it's true, then this old man will roll around the floor laughing twenty-four seven!"`
`"Rena thinks it's true.`
` If you laugh every day, it'll be fun every day."`
`"......Rena has a way with words."`
`"Then... should we try it out?"`
`Everyone took a deep breath, then brought their faces together, locking shoulders.`
` ...And then,`
`"""Wahh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...!!!"""`
`Everyone laughed uproariously from their stomachs...`
` trying to laugh out all of the bad stuff accumulating in them.`
`By the time our bento boxes were empty, everyone was right as rain...`
`Having heard our friendly banter, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun walked up and timidly spoke to us.`
`"...Excuse me... Maebara-san.`
` Sorry to interrupt your fun, but..."`
`"We need your help with something..."`
`They grinned dryly and scratched their heads.`
`"...Wait, what?!`
` Seriously...?!"`
`"That's not what we're here for!" said Tomita-kun, elbowing Okamura-kun.`
`"Umm, actually...`
` Our ball got caught in the gutter on the second floor.`
` We were thinking you might be able to reach it since you're tall..."`
`"I see.`
` Asking an upperclassman for help comes with its own price, you know.`
` I'm not cheap!`
` You can't buy me out so easily~!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun conversed for a short time, then gave their reply.`
`"We'll give you the right to take a nap during class, Maebara-san.`
` How does that sound?"`
`"...What do you mean?`
` I can sleep during class whenever I want.`
` Why do I need your permission for it?"`
`"Oh, no you can't.`
` The next time you take a nap, we'll tell Sensei about it."`
`"Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!`
` I see! How sly!"`
`"Y-You little~~!!`
` Where did you learn to bargain like that?!`
` Grrrrr!!"`
`"S-S-S-S-Sorry...!!`
` I-It, it was just a little joke...!!"`
`"Come on, Kei-chan~!`
` Why not just cave in to your underclassmen's threats?`
` Ku-ku-ku!"`
`And now Mion was getting on my nerves...`
`Suddenly, it came to me—and I took Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun's hands.`
`"All right, I surrender.`
` I'll get your ball for you, so give me all the rights to naptime."`
`"Huh...?`
` O-Oh, okay..."`
`"Look, Mion.`
` I now have the privilege.`
` But you don't, do you?`
` ...Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun.`
` Tell on Mion as soon as she falls asleep.`
` Got it?!"`
`""Yeah!!""`
`Rena and Rika-chan began to cackle at "Keiichi-kun's victory."`
`I... wasn't sure how the ball managed to get stuck up there, but it was planted firmly in the school building's second floor gutter.`
`"Hand me that stick.`
` I should be able to reach it.`
` ......Here we go...`
` Urgh...!"`
`I took a bamboo pole and poked the ball with it.`
`...Damn, it's hard!`
` Come on!!`
`"Oh, he got it!`
` You got it, Maebara-san!`
` Thank you so much!!"`
`The ball rolled down the gutter and fell down behind the school building.`
`My underclassmen ran over in that direction.`
`Leaving me by myself.`
`...Mission complete, I guess.`
`Sheesh.`
` There was still a lot of time left until lunch break was over.`
`Guess I should go back to the classroom.`
`I'd absorb myself in a silly conversation with everyone and wait for afternoon classes.`
`Just when I thought that and turned towards the entrance...`
` someone suddenly called out to me.`
`"Hello there—good day.`
` Sorry for bothering you during your lunch break."`
`...It was a middle-aged man I didn't know.`
`...Or maybe I'd passed by him a few times, and I'd seen his face... but I didn't know him.`
`When his half-smile deepened... something within me...`
` shuddered with fear.`
`......There was no basis for that.`
` No reason.`
`......But... I shuddered.`
`I was somewhat confused about those emotions... not quite understanding them myself.`
`There was one thing I could say, though.`
`...Nobody but teachers and students should be at school.`
` ...This person shouldn't have been here.`
`I felt less of a tremble... and more of a sense of dread... like a caterpillar, brilliantly-colored in garish, bilious greens, were crawling across my forehead.`
`...A feeling of disgust... that neither "itchy" nor "gross" could describe as the frizzly, dreadful hair rubbed against my brow.`
`...I didn't even want to see his face.`
`I wanted to jump backwards and run away.`
`...An unpleasant feeling... for which I didn't even know the cause.`
`The other side of myself has nothing but questions.`
`...Hey, what are you doing? What are you disgusted by? This is the first time you've met him.`
`It's rude to hate someone for no reason.`
`...No answers were coming.`
`...I held my silence, waiting, a damp sweat running down my forehead...`
`When he saw that, Ooishi thought maybe he was being intimidating, and gave me a relaxed smile.`
`"...Oh, please, excuse me.`
` I'm no one suspicious, I assure you.`
` Nfu-fu. I'm Ooishi—from the Okinomiya police department.`
` ...Wait, where did I put my card?`
` ...Hmm.`
` ...Huh?`
` What?`
` ...This is...`
` What?"`
`He fished through various pockets, then finally found his police ID and showed it to me, grinning dryly.`
`...He may have been trying to use those clumsy-seeming actions to ease my anxiety, but I could definitely say it didn't work.`
`...Why was I this nervous...?`
`There was a reason, of course.`
`If I wanted today to be the same as before... then today didn't need someone who hadn't been here back then.`
`...The fact that a man who wasn't here yesterday showed up today... meant that today would be a different day than those before it.`
`...That would...`
` mark the end of the fun and happy days...`
`I gulped and erased that ominous conclusion from my mind...`
`Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...`
`It's just an old guy, who looks kinda perverted and came from the police department—don't go deciding that the fun times are over...`
`......He just came here because of his job.`
`...Yeah, just for his job...`
`If he's working... then he would normally go to the teacher's lounge, right?`
`...The fact that he spoke to me... yes, it must have been to ask where it was.`
`"...Are you looking for the teacher's lounge?`
` You just have to go through the entrance and—"`
`I didn't want to look at this man for another second, so I started pushing things along.`
`...Ooishi, however, didn't seem to have any interest in the teacher's lounge.`
`"Oh, no.`
` I don't have anything to do there.`
` Could I get you to call a friend of yours, if I may be so bold?`
` Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`"...A friend?`
` Who?"`
`"A girl.`
` ...Could you call Satoko Houjou-san for me?"`
`My consciousness grew faint.`
` ...Like I was about to pass out...`
`Yes.`
` ...............My anxiety...`
` was realized.`
`The dreadful... disgusting caterpillar... was looking at me... about to crawl into my ear.`
`Its frizzly, dreadful hair... was touching my ear cavity......`
` That's how bad it felt...`
`"W-What do the police... need with Satoko?"`
`"No, no, no.`
` It's nothing important.`
` I just had two or three things to ask.`
` I'd like it if you could cooperate with me."`
`...Why...?`
`Why... of all people... was it Satoko...?`
`...Why would a police officer come here in the middle of the day... for something that wasn't important...?`
`This man was strange.`
`I could smell it.`
`...And it smelled bad—just a whiff of it made me want to grimace.`
`...I knew that this man...`
`couldn't possibly be here to deliver her lost wallet or anything.`
`......I couldn't imagine what he needed from Satoko... but it had to... be something unpleasant......`
`"............Ah."`
`My throat stung with burning pain.`
`...Burned, like a parched, creviced wasteland.`
`...The wasteland broke apart deep in my throat... and brought out the words from deep in my mind...`
`"...Um...... You may need something from her, but I don't think Satoko needs anything from you.`
` ...Could you please leave?"`
`Ooishi probably hadn't expected that reply.`
` ...He stood there surprised for a few moments.`
`...I did as well.`
`...I hadn't thought words like that could ever come out of my mouth.`
`...Things might still work out.`
`This guy may have shown up out of the blue... but if I drove him off, maybe I could make it so that it never happened.`
`...If I could do that... then I could get back...`
` the peace we had until yesterday... I could get it back...`
`"Nah-ha-ha-ha...! Well, well... You sure are strict.`
` Are you Satoko-san's manager, perhaps?`
` Can I not see her without an appointment?`
` Nfu-fu!"`
`"...If you just want to talk to her, shouldn't you just call her?`
` ...Barging into school in the middle of the day isn't normal."`
`"Breaking through a dam" would have been the perfect analogy to use.`
`...Why didn't I like this man?`
`This man shouldn't have been here.`
`I needed to make it so that this man wasn't here.`
`Childish, selfish emotions bubbled up from the depths of my mind, and they each came out of my mouth just as it had been formed.`
`Not liking the guy was my own problem.`
`...But to say things so bluntly to him...`
` Even I thought I was crazy.`
`"...Oh.`
` You're the logical sort, aren't you?`
` I'm not too good with people who talk like that..."`
`Ooishi grinned and scratched at his sweaty throat.`
`...Even as he feigned stupidity, I could tell he was irritated.`
`Hey, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...Why am I... looking for a fight with this old policeman here...?`
`It's not like... he brought the gift of misfortune with him, all wrapped up in paper, right?`
`Right.`
` ...It wasn't like he had brought a package of misfortune with him and was asking me to sign here please...`
`Rationally speaking, I understood all that...`
` so then, why was I so......`
`...Finally, I outlasted Ooishi in our game of silence, and he gave a big sigh.`
`Then he addressed a few of my female underclassmen running around nearby.`
`"Oh, excuse me, all of you!`
` Do you have a moment?`
` I'd like you to call Satoko Houjou-san if you could."`
`"....................."`
`My underclassmen tried to smile in reply, but they noticed the oddly stiff air atmosphere around me... and seemed hesitant to give a quick answer.`
`"...Is she not here?`
` Satoko Houjou-san?"`
`"Umm...... Houjou-san... she stayed home today..."`
`"Stayed home?"`
`...His face remained smiling... but his tone was clearly one of ill humor.`
`Such conspicuous spite caused my underclassmen, who had answered honestly, to cringe in fear...`
`"I see.`
` ..Nah-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` Dear me, dear me.`
` I'm quite unlucky."`
`...He was smiling broadly, but the way he laughed didn't make me feel better at all.`
`When he noticed that his laughter wasn't getting anyone else to laugh with him, he immediately stopped.`
`"...So.`
` You girls...`
` Could you tell me the name of this boy here?`
` Hm?"`
`He grabbed the girls by the shoulders so they wouldn't run away, and crouched down to address them at eye level.`
`...The girls flinched away from the sharp, piercing light in his eyes.`
`...And in exchange for their release, they didn't resist and told him my name...`
`"I see.`
` Keiichi Maebara-san, is that it?"`
`......He said my full name.`
`...That was all he said... and yet I couldn't help but shudder...`
`...It was like he had grabbed me by the collar just with those words.`
`"...Oh, could you be the son of the Maebara family I've heard so much about...?`
` Nah-ha-ha!`
` I hear your father is a renowned artist. `
` I don't know what sort of fantastic pictures he creates, though. `
`Then there's your mother—she seems intelligent too.`
` I heard she was a high academic achiever.`
`She went to some girls' university, didn't she?`
` It's amazing for someone that age to have graduated from a girls' university.`
` Could your mother actually be the daughter of a respectable family? `
`...At least, those are the rumors, and they say she's a cold person because of it—did you know that?`
`She only went to the very first neighborhood association meeting, right?`
` That's certainly no good.`
` You can't disrespect your neighbors in a place like this.`
` Mfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`...A sense of eeriness... slithered up my spine...`
`That was... my first experience of true terror.`
`I couldn't believe it felt this terrible... for someone you've just met... to know everything about you already...!`
`Ooishi clamped onto my shoulders... and brought his eyes close to peer into mine.`
`"In a place like this... it would be far better not to make enemies, wouldn't it?`
` If not..."`
`...Oww...!`
`Ooishi... dug into my shoulders with inhuman strength... gah...!`
`"...then if something unexpected were to happen, you might see some drawbacks.`
` ...Have you ever heard of karma?`
` It's like how a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a tornado. `
`...Grudges borne in strange places... could come back to you in ways you wouldn't believe.`
` ...You wouldn't... like that, would you?`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu...`
`Nobody wants to have a grudge held against them.`
` ...There's nothing positive... about making...`
` enemies. `
`...Hm?`
` What's the matter?`
` Your shoulders are very stiff.`
` Should I give you a massage?`
` See? Feels good, right?`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu...!"`
`Ow...... ow, ow... owww......!`
`This man wasn't just strong...`
` It was like...`
` he knew exactly where to press to make me feel pain...`
`Gah... Only four or five fingers were on my shoulders... and yet the pain... made me want to bend over backwards...`
` Urgh...!`
`A few of the girls from my class... were pretty shaken up... but didn't seem to want to help me.`
`...They weren't sure if they should go call the teacher...`
`...As for me... I couldn't take the time to wait until the teacher got here...`
` Kh...!`
` It... it hurts...!`
`"Would you mind leaving things at that?`
` You're hurting him."`
`"...Hm?"`
`Behind Ooishi-san... someone...`
` ...To my disbelief... it was Coach.`
`"...Oh my.`
` If it isn't Dr. Irie!`
` It certainly has been a while since we were last in touch.`
` Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`Discomforted by Coach's sudden appearance, Ooishi laughed scornfully.`
`...The vise on my shoulders, however, remained as strong as ever...`
`"Never mind the greetings.`
` Please... just let go of Maebara-kun."`
`Ooishi smiled daringly and glared straight at Coach.`
`He didn't release me in the meantime, of course...`
`"...I was just thinking of stopping by your place later, Doctor.`
` You always seem so busy and we can never have a good chat."`
`"Yes.`
` ...If you want, I'll chat with you all you like.`
` But, please be sure to have a warrant first.`
` ...After all, otherwise... I can refuse to go voluntarily into questioning."`
`...Coach didn't display a shred of the weird behavior he'd shown at the baseball game and barbecue.`
`...He stared steadily at Ooishi... and fought so that he would release me.`
`...His chances were terribly bad, of course.`
`...Compared to the relaxed Ooishi, Coach seemed like he was being defeated mentally.`
`...It made sense.`
`...Coach had a somewhat narrow stature, but Ooishi's body was packed with muscles.`
` ...It wasn't even a contest.`
`But... Coach was fighting for me, without taking a step back.`
`Beads of sweat formed on his face... and though he paled, he was fighting for my sake.`
`"..................`
` ...Na-ha-ha-ha-ha...!"`
`Suddenly, Ooishi laughed and let go of my shoulders.`
`...My body exhausted, I fell right onto my backside.`
`"...Maebara-kun!`
` Are you all right!?"`
`"...Urgh... damn it... oww..."`
`I rubbed my shoulders where Ooishi had latched onto them...`
`The pain from falling over went away quickly, but this pain was lingering.`
`"...Are you all right, Maebara-kun!?`
` ...This is terrible...!"`
`"Shit...... ow... oww..."`
`"I was just giving him a little massage!`
` Nfu-fu!`
` Maebara-san, aren't you overexaggerating a bit?`
` Boys have gotta learn to man up. Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`I wanted to retort...`
` but I couldn't think of anything witty.`
`"...Can you lift your shoulders?`
` Are they in pain?`
` ...If you're really hurt, then you should have a proper checkup.`
` Let's just go to the nurse's office...!"`
`Coach lent me his shoulder and walked beside me.`
`"What an exaggeration.`
` ...I'd be the last person to do any sort of permanent damage.`
` Right?`
` I am still an active police officer, you know.`
` Nfu-fu-fu...!"`
`"Come—I don't know what you needed to be here for, but if you're finished, then please leave!`
` ...I'm going to complain about this directly to the chief, so please keep that in mind."`
`"Oh, that's a problem, ain't it?`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu...!"`
`Ooishi-san waved his hand sarcastically, pivoted around, and headed to the car parked by the school gates.`
`...And without turning back around, he got in and started the engine.`
`......Damn it...`
`Who... who the hell was he... damn it...!`
`"He's a detective named Kuraudo Ooishi.`
` ...And a hooligan.`
` Everyone in the village hates him.`
` Maebara-san, you should be careful too."`
`...Kuraudo... Ooishi...`
`Just like I thought... My gut instinct wasn't wrong...`
`He would be the one.`
`...The one to bring unhappiness, misfortune... something that would ruin our peace...!`
`Shit... I won't accept it...!`
`All these fun days... can't possibly end just because some guy like him showed up.`
`...I won't... I won't accept it...!!`
`Coach seemed to be familiar with the school, so he brought me to the nurse's office without much trouble.`
`The girls from my class came along as well, looking worried.`
`Our teacher and the principal, having noticed the disturbance, came to see what was the matter.`
`"Maebara-kun...!`
` What's wrong?!`
` Are you hurt...!"`
`"Umm, well!!`
` There was this weird man in the schoolyard just now, and Maebara-san—!"`
`Coach gently interrupted the girls trying to explain.`
`"...No.`
` It looks like he just fell and twisted something.`
` I think he's all right, but I wanted to make sure.`
` If it's fine with you, I'll borrow the nurse's office for a bit."`
`"...Hm.`
` Please do, Dr. Irie."`
`The principal gave him a deep bow...`
`It looked like Coach was acquainted with the adults at school.`
`He slid open the doors to the nurse's office, but there wasn't a nurse in there or anything.`
`...I'd figured.`
`I'd never seen anyone but Chie-sensei and the principal working here.`
`Coach didn't seem to mind the fact that there was no nurse and quickly made his way into the nurse's office.`
`He instructed me to sit down and started washing his hands in the sink.`
`...Oh, I get it.`
`He's the coach for the boy's baseball team.`
`He must be pretty used to treating wounds with first-aid.`
`"Could you show me where it was?`
` ...Are you still in pain?"`
`"No... It doesn't hurt at all anymore.`
` ...I'm fine, really."`
`I rolled up my shirt and showed him my shoulder.`
` ...No bruise—not even nail marks.`
`And yet it had hurt so much I thought my shoulders would be crushed.`
`...Even the pain had disappeared without a trace.`
`...It hurt so much, but not so much as a bruise remained...`
`"It just means he's used to doing that."`
`...."Used to it," huh...`
`"The next time you meet, don't provoke him.`
` Nothing good will come of making him angry.`
` ...If you go home with a uniformed policeman by your side, your family won't like that, will they...?"`
`"......Well, you're right..."`
`"Still...`
` What happened?`
` Why did you end up in a fight with him?"`
`"...He... came up and said he needed something from Satoko..."`
`"Huh?`
` Satoko-chan...?"`
`...Coach's gaze lowered and his expression clouded a bit.`
`Somehow, that gesture seemed...`
` to be saying Ooishi was bound to come to Satoko, and did... and that it was no laughing matter.`
`"..............."`
`Coach fell silent in thought.`
`...Quietly, he took a compress out of the first-aid kit and put it on me.`
`"............"`
`"...Does he still plan on clinging to Satoko-chan?`
` ...He's a persistent man, I'll give him that—like a snake."`
`Coach mumbled to himself.`
`"...Cling?`
` ...Does that Ooishi guy go to Satoko's place a lot?"`
`"........."`
`Coach didn't answer, but the lack of a denial served well enough.`
`...What on earth did the policeman (probably a detective or something...) need from Satoko?`
`What mistake had led a detective to cling to the sweetly-smiling Satoko...?`
`"...Maebara-san...`
` Oh, right.`
` You just moved here, didn't you?"`
`"...Y......yes.`
` I did, but..."`
`"......Have you heard anything about...`
` Oyashiro-sama's curse, and about Satoko-chan?"`
`...Well, I knew a few things about it, certainly.`
`"...Satoko's parents were dam proponents...`
` and their accidental death was because of the curse...`
` You mean that...?"`
`Coach smiled thinly and dryly—"So you know..." he said, dropping his gaze.`
`If I recalled correctly, there was an accident on a viewing platform at the public park she'd gone to with her family, and her parents died.`
`And then... it was just big brother and little sister...`
` ...and then she was with Rika-chan, and......`
` Umm.........`
`"When they lost their parents, Satoko-chan and her brother, Satoshi-kun, were given to their uncle and his wife to care for them."`
`"...Uh...... Oh, is that so..."`
`Their parents died in the accident and Satoshi ran away, leaving only Satoko to start living with Rika-chan...`
`I'd known that much, but this was the first time I heard they'd been brought to their uncle and aunt.`
`"Their uncle was Satoko-chan's father's younger brother.`
` ...Unfortunately, neither of the couple were people deserving of respect."`
`Coach normally picked his words politely.`
`...So when he came out and said they didn't deserve respect, it really made me wonder what kind of people they were...`
`"...As soon as Satoko-chan's parents came out in support of the dam, their uncle and aunt took on a lot of the shame in the village as well.`
` They would never have welcomed in Satoko-chan and Satoshi-kun. `
`......I've heard that for the siblings, it was a very rough life..."`
`Bit by bit, Coach told me about the numerous agonies the Houjou siblings had suffered at their uncle's house.`
`As their guardians, their aunt and uncle sucked up everything belonging to their immediate family.`
`...Satoko and Satoshi were crammed into a small room, and their lives were laden with things that were miserable both for their bodies and minds.`
`In the first place, since apparently their aunt and uncle weren't on good terms, there was no end to their fighting.`
`...And as if in revenge for that, whenever they saw Satoko or Satoshi's face,`
` they would always find fault with them, scold them, yell at them, strike them, and take away meals as punishment.`
`"...I still shudder to think about it. `
`...You've never known any Satoko but the energetic and healthy one now...`
` so you probably couldn't imagine her face being so deathly pale, a girl always standing dazed in the shade of trees..."`
`......I couldn't imagine it, and I didn't want to—that was how I honestly felt.`
`...But at the very least, Satoko wasn't like that anymore.`
`She may have had a miserable life in the past, but it was different now.`
`......Something happened to change that life.`
`"...Last year, on the night of the Watanagashi Festival, their aunt died.`
`...Rumors spread of the curse having killed an enemy of the village on the night of the festival.`
` This death wasn't a simple homicide either—they whispered that it was actually Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`A few days later, the deviant arrested for drug use confessed to further offenses and the incident was resolved.`
`...However, though it was resolved... no one knew whether the part about it being Oyashiro-sama's curse was true or not.`
`"Their uncle is part of Hinamizawa, after all.`
` He apparently grew incredibly frightened of Oyashiro-sama's curse and went into hiding.`
`"......And Satoko and Satoshi...`
` Were they released?"`
`"Their aunt died, and their uncle fled.`
` ...There was nobody left to torment the siblings then, but.........`
` as if picking up their torch, that man started showing up with alarming tenacity."`
`"...That man?"`
`Then Coach lowered his voice just a bit as if being aware of his surroundings.`
`"I mean Ooishi."`
`"......Ooishi.`
` ......The guy from before..."`
`The events that just occurred came back to me.`
`The hard-to-describe ominous sensation I'd felt from him came back to me.`
`"...He's a little strange.`
`...The chain of incidents surrounding Oyashiro-sama's curse have all been solved... and yet he alone doesn't want to accept that."`
`...Accept it?`
`...The incidents were all solved, and a detective supposedly with the police department...`
` didn't accept that?`
`"......People say that something bad will surely happen to those he gets close to.`
` ...In Hinamizawa, they think Ooishi is Oyashiro-sama's—"`
`"Kei-chaaaaaaan!!"`
`The door flew open with a rattle and Mion came rushing in.`
`Rena and Rika-chan came running in a few steps behind her, and then Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun, and a few more of our classmates.`
`"K-Kei-chan...!`
` Did Ooishi do something to you?!`
` Are you hurt...?!"`
`"Calm down, Mion-san.`
` He's not injured.`
` I only gave him a compress just in case."`
`"Keiichi-kun, are you really okay?`
` Okay?!`
` Everyone was saying stuff about how you were being strangled...!"`
`"Calm down, Rena.`
` He just squeezed my shoulders really hard.`
` See, there's not even a bruise!"`
`"......Meep."`
`"Geez!`
` What the heck were you all doing?!`
` We're friends, right?!`
` Why were you just standing around?!`
` Why didn't you help Kei-chan?!"`
`"W-We're sorry... President..."`
`Mion yelled at our classmates, baring her fangs.`
`Tomita-kun and the others hung their heads in silence.`
`"Quit it, Mion...`
` Tomita-kun and the others weren't even there.`
` Stop blaming them."`
`"Damn...... Damn it!!`
` Ooishi...!!"`
`Mion kicked the floor with her heel a few times, her temper running hot.`
`Our teacher, overhearing the commotion, arrived as well.`
`"Hey, come on, everyone!`
` Don't make so much noise in the nurse's office!`
` President, take everyone and leave, please!"`
`"Come on, everyone!`
` Let's get going!`
` Keiichi-kun is fine.`
` You too, Mii-chan."`
`Mion was letting her emotions get the best of her, so Rena stepped in instead and led everyone out of the nurse's office.`
`The detective from Okinomiya Station, Kuraudo Ooishi...`
`...It looked like the first impression I'd gotten from him hadn't been mistaken.`
`Satoko's absence had amplified the vague apprehensions I'd felt since yesterday...`
` and Ooishi's appearance basically sealed the deal.`
`"All right.`
` ...I'll get going.`
` I originally came here for Chie-sensei."`
`"...Ah... So you had something to do here...`
` Sorry for causing you trouble..."`
`"Don't be so humble," he said, smiling easily.`
`"There was a side benefit to all this.`
` ...I was lucky enough to experience so much of your soft, silky skin, Maebara-kun.`
` Hafuu~~~...☆."`
`With the usual (for Coach, anyway) parting words, he instead continued.`
`"Please excuse me.`
` You weren't wounded badly, but please avoid putting pressure on your shoulders or anything along those lines. `
`If you get a high fever or it starts to swell, contact me right away, okay?`
` I don't think it'll happen, though."`
`"...Oh... That's right, Coach.`
` ...Before everyone came in, you were going to say something.`
` About what people think Ooishi is to Oyashiro-sama."`
`As he was about to leave the nurse's office, Coach placed a hand on the door and stopped.`
`"...Right.`
` They think he's`
` Oyashiro-sama's servant`
`.`
` They're just bad-mouthing him, though."`
`"...Oyashiro-sama's... servant?"`
`"...Do you know about the serial freak death incidents that occur in Hinamizawa every year on the night of the Watanagashi Festival... otherwise known as Oyashiro-sama's curse?"`
`"...What... Freak deaths...?`
` What...?"`
`Now that I thought about it... I did seem to remember overhearing Mion or someone in class talking about it like a ghost story...`
`On the festival day in June, one person would always die,`
` and another person would be spirited away (but they seem to call it "demoning away" here...).`
` ...What a fine story that was.`
`I figured they made it up to scare me, but.........`
`...It was true...?`
`"...I don't have any idea who first suggested this.`
` ...But at some point, everyone started calling Ooishi 'Oyashiro-sama's servant.'"`
`"...Why?"`
`"...Because the rumors go that he...`
` decides the sacrifices for the curse every year."`
`Whenever June came around, Ooishi would start paying frequent visits to Hinamizawa.`
`"...Because Ooishi had been persistently questioning most of the dead or disappeared people."`
`Four years ago, it was known that the victim of the dismemberment—rumored to be the sacrifice—had been seeing Ooishi numerous times leading up to the incident.`
`The sacrifices three years ago were Satoko's parents.`
`...Right before their accidental deaths, Ooishi had apparently visited their home.`
`The one who disappeared two years ago was Rika-chan's mother.`
`And again, people know that before she vanished, Ooishi had been talking to her extremely frequently.`
`The one who disappeared last year... Satoko's older brother,`
` Satoshi.`
`Satoshi, too, had apparently been approached by Ooishi many times before he vanished...`
`And then, this year.`
`...This time... Ooishi was trying to contact Satoko...?`
`".........This... This isn't... a freaking joke."`
`"They're rumors, Maebara-san.`
` ...There's just some rumors to that effect."`
`"....................."`
`I hadn't said that because of the rumors of Ooishi being Oyashiro-sama's servant, or his contacting someone foreshadowing who would be the sacrifice that year.`
`...It was because the ominous hatred I felt towards Ooishi was becoming... more substantiated, more real.`
`"Umm...... Today, Satoko... She was absent today."`
`"Wait, really?"`
`That looked like news to Coach.`
`...I had thought he might have known why Satoko was absent today, but...`
`"Then I'll get going.`
` You should go back to the others and put their minds at ease."`
`"You're right.`
` ...I will."`
`Clatter.`
`...Coach left the nurse's office and headed towards the teacher's lounge...`
