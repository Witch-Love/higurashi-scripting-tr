`"Oh, really?`
` Your parents came home, huh?"`
`"They smelled like energy drinks, and their eyes were all bloodshot.`
` They said they had a crazy amount of stuff to do, and were up two whole nights in a row.`
` Adults have it tough."`
`"Your dad is an artist, right?`
` They really do have it rough."`
`"Come to think of it, he was, wasn't he?`
` I would very much like to see what kind of things he draws sometime!"`
`...An artist, huh.`
`I'd seen a number of watercolor and acrylic paintings on display, but he had to have been doing some other job too.`
`...Just what did Dad do, exactly?`
`...He didn't let anyone into his workshop, after all.`
` I wanted to sneak a peek one day.`
`"So the house was empty for two days after all that?`
` Hu-hu-hu, that didn't leave much time! `
`So?`
` Kei-chan, did you manage to go after the character who was in your heart?!`
` The absence of parents is a must-have for eroge protagonists!"`
`"...He built up a lot of relationship points and raised all the right flags."`
`I have no idea what any of you are talking about...`
`"That means you don't need to cook for yourself anymore, Keiichi-kun.`
` What did you make last night? Last night?"`
`Hm... hmm.`
`...In the end, I...`
` I didn't make a single thing myself.`
`"Last night's dinner, well... it was vegetable stir-fry."`
`"Wow!`
` Kei-chan, you can make a little bit of real cooking now, huh?"`
`"Hmm☆.`
` You made vegetable stir-fry?`
` Did it come out good? Did it?!"`
`"...Rena-san, you're being unpleasant.`
` Why are you clinging to me...?"`
`"...A delicious meal, and friendly dish-washing together."`
`"H-Hau~~~~☆. How nice, how nice!!"`
`"Hey!`
` I said, you're being unpleasant~!!"`
`"...Huh? What are you talking about??"`
`Mion, utterly confused, asked me for clarification, but I just barely, albeit transparently, averted my eyes.`
`"Right, right!`
` Does anyone have plans for this afternoon?`
` You don't, do you? Do you!?"`
`Today was Saturday.`
`The beautiful day on which we're liberated from the confines of school in the afternoon.`
`Actually, the school in Hinamizawa had slightly different Saturdays than those in the city.`
`There were a lot of students here who brought a bento, ate it at lunch, and then went to play in the school or around the schoolyard.`
`You could say that the entire school turned into a children's playground...`
`There were mountains behind the school, and if you went down that way, you'd find mountain streams.`
`You could avoid the strong sunlight and make conversation in the classroom if you wanted, too.`
`You could also play hide-and-seek in the construction pipes.`
`Of course, you were free to go home as well.`
`There were some kids who went home and helped water the fields, or tended to stores.`
`If Mion was bringing up the afternoon like this...`
` Then it must have been for some crazy big club event!`
`...However.`
`Sadly, I had something I needed to do before taking part in whatever it was.`
`"...You have work?`
` That's unlucky."`
`"I wonder what kind of work it is.`
` Maybe helping his father with his artwork job."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Or being a model for his father's art?`
` ...A model?`
` A nude one?`
` Hau~~~♪."`
`...I looked into Rena's eyes... and saw myself completely naked in a questionable pose with a single rose in my mouth?!`
`"No, no!`
` I wouldn't do that for a million yen!"`
`To get rid of Rena's delusions, I grabbed her head and swung it from side to side.`
`"Hau~~~~!!`
` Stoooooopppppp!!"`
`"...Er, sorry.`
` Leaving your fanciful delusions aside,`
` I have something to do real quick during lunch.`
` I'm OK to meet up with you after I'm done though."`
`"Work during lunch?`
` I see!`
` That sounds kind of cool, actually.`
` What could it be?`
` Are you having a banquet with VIP experts?`
` Like a business lunch?!"`
`"...Urgh.`
` ......This is truly sad... but you're right."`
`"""Whaaaat?!"""`
`Everyone shouts wildly, surprised...`
`It was true.`
` Today I'd be on the job with my family.`
`For my dad's job, he was having about ten people from the publishing agency over for a house party.`
`He called people from work for a party the day after having stayed up two nights in a row—I'm amazed at their vitality.`
`...Adults have it pretty rough.`
`Of course, it would be incredibly uncomfortable for me.`
`It would be really tiring to have to force myself to smile at some old dudes I didn't know.`
`But... they were my dad's important business connections, so offending them would be bad...`
`Well, with all that said, it was going to get very uncomfortable for me today, starting at lunch.`
`"Well, well!`
` What an intelligent child...!"`
`"This is my son, Keiichi.`
` Keiichi, this is Honda-san, he's a publisher.`
` And this person here is Inoue-san, who works as a printer.`
` Say your hellos."`
`"H-Hello.`
` My name is Keiichi.`
` I appreciate all you've done for my father..."`
`"Keiichi-kun, do you draw pictures like your father does?`
` I would very much like to see them!"`
`My dad had such a brazen occupation—that of an artist.`
`Although... I don't really know what kinds of things he creates.`
`I don't really care, and don't want to see anyway.`
`Dad's so tightfisted about it, so he doesn't show them to me very often anyway.`
`I'm not a kid anymore, so I wouldn't care at all if they were pictures of naked ladies or anything.`
`"If you study under your father as an apprentice, you'd be able to become a great artist like him, too."`
`"...Excuse me...`
` This is just between you and me, but...`
` My dad... Is he really that great of an artist?"`
`I readied myself... and whispered my question.`
`It might have seemed odd for his son to be asking this, but...`
`When I did...`
` He`
` gave`
` me`
` this`
` really`
` strange`
` grin`
` and tightly clamped down onto my shoulders.`
`"Yes!!`
` He is truly... truly a fantastic artist!!"`
`"I-Is that so...?`
` I'm glad to hear it..."`
`"There are no purchase restrictions,`
` he does fanservice,`
` and he always answers the letters he gets!`
` He has an inquisitive mind, always on the prowl for what the world needs!!`
` Taking off your socks? Absolutely not!`
`And that goes for glasses and school uniforms too!`
` Maebara-sensei understands these things perfectly!!`
` Every event sees him along the wall, with a huge lineup..."`
`"U-Uh, I'm sorry, but...`
` His pictures... they're not ones you hang on the wall...??"`
`"Not at all!`
` In the beginning, everyone starts in the islands!`
` And then to their corners,`
` and finally climbing up to the corners of the larger paths!`
`The final destination is the famous wall!!`
`You too!`
` Please, become a great artist who can display his works in unison with Maebara-sensei!!`
` I'll cheer you on!!!"`
`I-It's fine to have a lot of passion for the things you like, but...`
`I didn't get it... but it seemed that the world of art ran pretty deep...`
`It was probably a much deeper world than I could have imagined.`
` ...I decided to leave it at that.`
`Then, I realized my mom was calling me from the other side of the room.`
`"Keiichi!`
` It's the phone.`
` It's a friend of yours."`
`A lucky break!`
`Maybe I could get out of this uncomfortable business party by using a friend's phone call as an excuse.`
`I scampered over to the front door and snatched up the receiver my mom had left there.`
`"Hello!`
` It's me~!"`
`"Hello, me!`
` That's not how you answer the phone, Keiichi-san.`
` I implore you, learn how to choose your words more properly!"`
`...I was of the opinion that the person speaking to me had a far stranger way of talking.`
`"Oh, it's Satoko!`
` It's unusual for you to call my house."`
`"This isn't the time for pleasantries!`
` Keiichi-san, when are you going to be able to come?!"`
`"S-Sorry...`
` It looks like this is going a bit long...`
` I can't get them to let me go...`
` I want to go do things with the club now, but..."`
`"That's not it, Keiichi-san!`
` It wasn't about the club today.`
` It's a real battle!!"`
`Satoko's voice was different from normal.`
`...I could feel the urgency in it drifting through the phone!`
`"A-A real battle?!`
` That doesn't sound good!`
` What's the situation?!"`
`"I will explain the particulars when we meet!`
` Anyway... this is a terrible crisis!!`
` At this rate we're going to lose!!"`
`What on earth was going on?!`
`Could it have been... a fight?!`
`I didn't know who they were, but laying a hand on someone from Hinamizawa was an absolutely terrible idea!`
`"Right!`
` Got it!!`
` I'll come and reinforce you right away!!`
` Where are you at?!"`
`"We're on the Okinomiya elementary school campus!`
` There are signs at the station, so you should be able to figure it out!!`
` Anyway, we're in a huge hurry!!"`
`The school campus..!`
`The situation could have a lot of people involved...`
` Could it have turned into an all-out brawl?!`
`Who was the enemy here, anyway?!`
` Ooohhhhh!! I'm on fire!!`
`"Got it!`
` I'll be there soon!!`
` Should I bring a weapon with me?!`
` Like a metal baseball bat or something?!"`
`"You have a metal bat?!`
` That would be fantastic!!`
` We will wait for you here!!"`
`The call cut off abruptly.`
`I needed to hurry!!`
`"Oh, Keiichi.`
` I was looking for you.`
` Deguchi-san here was hoping that for his next dojinshi—"`
`"Now's not the time!`
` Don't we have a bat?!`
` A metal bat?!`
` If not... then anything long will do!!"`
`"...I-If anything long will do... then my golf clubs are in the storage room."`
`It didn't have the same kind of impact... but a golf club was a splendid weapon too!`
`It was lighter than a baseball bat, and maybe easier for me to use!`
`"Thanks!`
` I'm borrowing one!!`
` I really need to go see my friends for something—it's urgent!!`
` Sorry!!"`
`"Wha— Keiichi!?`
` Wait a minute...!!"`
`I grabbed a golf club, jumped on my bike, and headed straight for town...!`
`Wait for me, Satoko!`
`I'll be right there!!`
`Just hold out until then!!`
`I didn't actually know where Okinomiya Elementary was exactly.`
`But Satoko's phone call seemed to demand urgency, so I rushed out without asking her about how to get there...`
`...But if I went to the station, there would be signs... At least, I feel like that's what she said...`
`Then I heard the jingling of a bicycle bell from behind me.`
`"...Hello there."`
`"Hey!`
` Rika-chan!!`
` ...Hah! Hah!"`
`"...Keiichi, you came quickly.`
` You put the pedal to the metal."`
`Damn!`
`This isn't the time to be out of breath!`
` I need to hurry!!`
`"S-Sorry!!`
` Where is Okinomiya Elementary?!"`
`"...I'll show you the way.`
` Come along with me."`
`Rika-chan rode off on her bike.`
` I followed her.`
`"Satoko suddenly called me out here... But what on earth is going on, anyway?!"`
`"...At first, we had the advantage.`
` ...However... they called in a helper.`
` It's bad manners."`
`A helper?!`
`What cowards—calling for reinforcements the minute they realize they'd lose!!`
`"...They're taking everyone out one by one.`
` ...We can't put a dent in them."`
`...Gulp.`
` ...Sounds like they were pretty strong...`
`"Anyway, I'll ask about it later!`
` We don't have time, right?!`
` Please hurry!"`
`"...Leave it to me."`
`With Rika-chan leading the way, we headed straight for the elementary school grounds!`
`I asked Rika-chan something during that time...`
`It seemed that all of the club members besides me were part of this fight.`
`...Damn, so what Mion was trying to tell everyone... was that this would happen?!`
`If I had known that, I would have just ditched my family job!!`
` ...But it was too late for regrets.`
`According to Rika-chan, we had a one-sided advantage at the start, but our angry foes had brought in a powerful ally.`
`...The club members put up a resistance and went against them one by one... but apparently they couldn't stand up to them!!`
`"The combined efforts of the whole club couldn't win?!`
` Just... just what kind of monster is this guy?!"`
`"...He's amazing.`
` This enemy is orthodox."`
`...Orthodox...`
`So they weren't using thuggish brawling tactics, but had actually studied karate or something—is that what she meant...?!`
`"...Keiichi is our last ray of hope now."`
`Okinomiya Elementary came into view.`
`...I could hear many voices raising hell over there!!`
`"Woohhhhhh!!`
` Mion!`
` Rena!`
` Satokooo!!`
` I'll be there sooooon!!`
` I'll crush them all at once!!"`
`There were a lot of bicycles left out in front of the school.`
`I left mine there next to them in the same way.`
`I could tell there were a lot of people flooding the campus.`
`...Were the two armies in the midst of a huge, no-holds-barred brawl?!`
`I took my golf club in hand.`
`Woosh! I swung it.`
`I felt the sensation of it sticking firmly to my palm.`
`Great!!`
` The feedback wasn't bad!`
` I'm gonna go all-out with this thing!!`
`I dashed at a breakneck speed to the school gates, swinging it around...!!!`
`"Come with me, Rika-chan!!`
` I will show you what the mighty, manly warrior, Keiichi Maebara, can really do!!!"`
`"...Wow.`
` Keiichi, you're so reliable.`
` You're going to rampage with a golf club."`
`Rika-chan applauded me, though a little dryly, lauding my valiance!`
` The manly Keiichi Maebara put it behind him and headed for the place where he may die!!`
`"...But Keiichi.`
` ...Why did you bring a golf club today?"`
`"I had no choice!`
` At first I figured a baseball bat would have been good, but we don't have one at my house.`
` A golf club was far better than going bare-handed, so I brought one!!"`
`"...How very excellent.`
` I will give you a pat on the head.`
` I can't wait to see your golf club rampage."`
` Despite the emergency situation, Rika-chan reached up and stroked me on the head.`
`"H-Hey!`
` This is no time for jokes!!`
` ............Huh?"`
`Crrrrrrraaaaaackkkkk!!`
`Just then, an extremely loud metallic sound rang out, and I heard many people cheering.`
`"Left!`
` Ahhhh...! We missed!"`
`"Ruuunnn!!`
` You can get to second base—go!!"`
`"Center!!`
` Calm down!!`
` Send it to third!!"`
`The center fielder caught the ball, and after a brief pause, sent it flying to third base.`
`If he had pitched it wildly, it might get there.`
`He gave up on second and threw it to third with time to spare...`
` The instructions from the bench—they were solid...!`
` .........Wait... what?`
`"Oh, Keiichi-kun's here!`
` Satoko-chan, Satoko-chan, Keiichi-kun's here!!"`
`"You're late, late, late!!`
` Loafing around is only okay when you do it at the bread shop!!"`
`"This Maebara-kun kid... Will he really be able to save us...?`
` We're up against the ace of Ooshima—left-arm Kameda-kun!`
` To be able to beat a Koshien-class pitcher... He must be a god...!"`
`"It's okay.`
` I'm sure... that Keiichi-kun can turn the tables!`
` He's a really dependable person!"`
`Murmur!!`
`"...What?! He's the pinch hitter we brought in to take out... Left-Arm Kameda, with his bullet fastball?!`
`The one who had one no-hit no-run game after another during the regional qualifiers—the undefeated demon pitcher of Ooshima...`
`The super high school level pitcher that had already been marked by professional scouts... he's going to win against him?!"`
`"Some greenhorn pitcher like that is no match for Keiichi-san!!`
` He'll send his throws all the way to the back screen for an easy victory!!"`
`Murmur murmur!!`
`"There was a slugger like that in this prefecture?!"`
` "I-I had no idea!"`
` "He must have gone under the radar!!"`
` "Hey!`
` That scout stood up...!!"`
` "Hey!`
` Take a picture!!" `
`"His full name is Keiichi Maebara... Look him up in the database and send his history to our office!!!"`
`"Which one is Keiichi Maebara?!`
` Pictures, pictures!!"`
`A whole lot of sports journalists, led by Satoko, gripped their cameras tightly and searched for the rumored Keiichi Maebara.`
`As for me, I was so dazed... at what was happening... that I was frozen in place with my golf club up in the air...`
`"Keiichi-san, Keiichi-san, over heeeere...!!!`
` ......Eh?"`
`The camera people stared at me through their viewfinders... and just like I had...... they turned to stone.`
`...In the hands of their gallant pinch hitter, Keiichi Maebara, was...... a golf... club...`
`Nobody could... seem to understand why... I was holding something like this.`
` ...And at this point... neither did I......`
`Cheeeeep cheep cheep cheep cheep... A cold, greasy sweat dripped from me...`
`The first one to break the inordinately awkward silence... was Rena.`
`"......Um... Ke-Keiichi-kun."`
`"Y-Yeah...?"`
`"May we...... ask you a question...?"`
`...Please...`
`Please don't.`
`...Psychic waves of my entreaty flowed out of my face along with my sweat...`
` It somehow seemed to reach the two of them...`
`The deathly quiet reporters all parted... as Moses once parted the sea.`
`...But Moses probably didn't go through the parted seas this quietly...`
`"I-If you were playing baseball, then tell me that from the staaaaaaaaaaart!!!"`
`"Whaaaat?!`
` Did I not say that?!`
` I mean, I told you to come to the campus with a baseball bat—what else could you have thought it was?! `
`And... what manner of thinking caused you to mistakenly bring a golf club here instead?!"`
`"Umm... I think, I think!`
` K-Keiichi-kun must have... done it on purpose to lighten our moods and get us pumped, I think.`
` ......I think!"`
`Rena smiled bitterly and covered for me with all her might.`
`Please believe her, everyone...`
` I-I'm begging you~...`
`"...Keiichi loves golf.`
` ...Pet pet."`
`...Rika-chan started patting my head, a broad grin on her face all the while.`
`I pushed her hand away, grabbed her from behind by her suspenders, and picked her up like a kitten.`
`"...Meeep."`
`"Riiikaaa-chaaaaan...!!`
` Why didn't you tell me it was a baseball game when we met at the station!?`
` I wouldn't have had to suffer such a disgrace!!"`
`"...Nipah~☆."`
`Rika-chan's smile was like the sun—so incredibly innocent.`
`Urgh... S-She's glowing...`
`When I saw Rika-chan's radiant smile, I couldn't help but feel like I could forgive anything she did...`
`However!`
`If Rika-chan thought I actually would, then she had another thing coming!!`
`"Anyway, this is your punishment.`
` ...Rena."`
`"...Meep?"`
`Rika-chan still plucked up in my hand, I offered her to Rena.`
`...That's right.`
`The kitten-ified Rika-chan sent Rena's voltage into overcharge!!`
`"H-Hau~~~~!!!`
` I'll take her, I'll take her!!`
` Rena will take her~!!`
` Hau~!!`
` So kyute~~!!!"`
`Hop!`
` Spinny spinny!!`
`Rena stuck out her tongue like a chameleon and preyed upon Rika-chan while spinning her around!`
`"Rika-chan's so kyute!`
` Rika-chan's so kyute!!`
` Hau~~!!"`
`"Meep! Meep~~~!!"`
`...Rena held her tight as a vise and began to get her fill of rubbing her cheek into Rika-chan's.`
`Their cheeks rubbed together tightly.`
` Rika-chan's face...`
` It looked like it was being crushed by Rena's...`
`"...I do not know what has happened... but it looks like Rika has gotten her just desserts."`
`"Yeah.`
` I recently found out that Rika-chan isn't only cute..."`
`"Hau~~!!`
` I got Keiichi-kun's permission~!!`
` I'm gonna take you home~~~~!!!"`
`"...Meeeep!!`
` Meeep!!`
` Meep~~~!!"`
`For the moment, I just gave her a three-minute timeout.`
`"...By the way, Satoko.`
` That urgent call was for a baseball game?"`
`"Yes, that's correct.`
` ...You said you had a house party with your family?`
` I suppose I was wrong to ask, but...`
` At times of trouble like these, you obviously must prioritize friends over family!"`
`...I felt like that's what I was supposed to be saying, not you.`
` Well, it was just a business party for my dad, I guess.`
` I honestly felt glad to be called out here.`
`"So what's the crisis situation like?`
` ...6 to 7.`
` Which means our team is losing, huh?`
` ...Hm?`
` Two outs in the bottom of the ninth?!`
` What the heck?`
` This game is almost about to end...!"`
`"We would have had a little more time if you'd gotten here sooner!`
` Do you have any idea how difficult it was for us to hold out for this long?!"`
`"...All right, all right, I'm sorry!`
` Okay, so?`
` What am I doing?`
` Am I gonna be the pinch hitter?`
` Just leave it to me!`
` I may not look like it, but I went to the batting cages a lot before I moved here. `
`My dad went there for fun, and I used to go with him pretty often.`
` I'm pretty confident about just hitting the bat with the ball, but..."`
`Vrrrooooooooooooooomm!!`
`...A tremendous sound rang out, the likes of which I'd never heard before.`
` ...The catcher's mitt trembled, sending up a light cloud of dust... telling me the tremendous sound had come from the ball.`
`"...Hey, now, wait a second...`
` What's up with that crazy fastball, anyway?"`
`"...Surprised?`
` Yeah.`
` That's a bona fide Koshien-level pitcher.`
` Don't you know about Left-Arm Kameda-kun, the ace of Ooshima?"`
`"Sorry, can't say I do.`
` ...Wait, Mion?!`
` W-What happened to you?!"`
`Mion showed up... and to my surprise, she was wrapped up in bandages!`
` J-Just what on earth happened?!`
`"Well... You came late, so I guess we need to explain from the beginning."`
`"Oh, hm? Done with Rika-chan?"`
`"Yep.`
` I had a lot of fun and she's so kyute.`
` She's so soft and fluffy and squishy~☆.`
` Hau~~ I could eat just her cheeks three meals a day~."`
`"...Meep. I can't get married anymore..."`
`...Ah, I wonder how Rika-chan's cheeks taste if you could eat them three times a day☆.`
`...It almost flipped my own delusion switch, but I put a stop to it using logic.`
` ...I was an adult.`
`"Okay, explain away.`
` ...How did things get screwed up enough that a Koshien relief pitcher ended up in a baseball game for fun...?"`
`Everyone exchanged glances.`
` Then, Rena spoke for all of them.`
`"Mm-hmm.`
` At first, well...`
` It was just a normal baseball game."`
`"It's nothing much—just a little grudge match between the Hinamizawa Fighters and the Okinomiya Titans.`
` We were just having a grand old time—really, nothing much."`
`"Well, in simpler terms, it was an intramural match.`
` A match to settle the grudge between Hinamizawa and Okinomiya!"`
`"We say 'grudge,' but it's all pretty peaceful and friendly."`
`"...So, why is our whole club a part of it?`
` Some of you are wearing uniforms, and some aren't.`
` ...Last I checked, we weren't the school baseball team."`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` That is... well, it was pretty irresponsible."`
`"They happened to have some players who couldn't make it today.`
` They were pretty down in the dumps, so we ended up getting involved posthaste."`
`I see.`
`So if there weren't enough members, anyone could come to the rescue, whether boy or girl and no matter what grade they were in.`
`That jumbled-together feeling was the hallmark of our school.`
`"But Rika-chan told me we were crushing them at the beginning."`
`"...Mii is an amazing batter.`
` She was hitting home runs left and right."`
`Mion proudly stuck out her chest.`
` Doing so seemed to hurt her somehow, and she groaned pathetically...`
`"Yes!`
` Every time Mion-san went up to bat, she hit a home run and brought everyone on the bases in!"`
`"...Unlike Satoko, she can actually hit the ball."`
`"Rikaa!"`
`"...Meep~~!!"`
`"...All right, I think I got the gist of it.`
` So you were having a pretty easy time until that Koshien pitcher showed up."`
`"That's right.`
` It was all us at the beginning.`
` Maybe we didn't get all that many points, but we were always getting people on the bases..."`
`"And Kameda-kun from Ooshima just happened to show up to watch the game today."`
`Ooshima was apparently a fairly well-known school in our prefecture that frequently sent people to Koshien.`
`And this man known as the ace of their baseball team, Kameda... seemed to be quite skilled.`
`...Now that I thought about it, it was certainly strange to see cameramen with journalist armbands here to watch a casual baseball game out in the sticks like this.`
`"...I heard that when Kameda was little, he was on the Okinomiya Titans."`
`"...You've figured it out, right?`
` His old team was losing, so that's why he jumped in as relief pitcher and took the mound... `
`Now it's just terrible.`
` We can't even hit any foul balls, much less get anyone on base."`
`"But still!!`
` A Koshien pitcher barging in... It's unfair! We're just playing for fun!!!"`
`All the boys wearing the Hinamizawa Fighters uniform... were hanging their heads in disappointment...`
`I knew almost all of their faces.`
`Isn't everyone here a classmate?`
` ...Oh, I see.`
` We're the only school in Hinamizawa, after all.`
`"Oh, it's Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun.`
` You were on the baseball team too?"`
`"...M-Maebara-san...... mgh..."`
`His uniform was brand new, and not very dirty—fresh off the presses.`
`...I could see hand-made banners with their names written on them in the grandstands.`
`...I see—their families came to root for them in their debut game today.`
`"...Okamura said he just got his bat today as a present from his dad."`
`The brand new bat sparkled.`
`...With that kind of present, a man just has to perform well.`
`"He practiced swinging a whole lot, just for today.`
` Tomita-san, well, he went too far... and he tore the skin off his hand, see...`
` unfortunately..."`
`His torn hand looked like it hurt, but from that injury, you could sense his backbone.`
`I get it, guys.`
` You wanted to make your big moment a good one...!!`
`Vrrooooooommmmmm!!`
`The savior of the Okinomiya Titans—we could hear the sounds of this Kameda-kun's tremendous fastball practice.`
`This was... no joke.`
`He was definitely on a level far above high school kids.`
`...But at his level... he clearly shouldn't have been interrupting a grass-lot game, grudge match though it may have been.`
` He should have understood how much better he was, too...`
`"......This guy.`
` Was he being serious against opponents like these...?"`
`"...Yep.`
` ...Rena thinks it's immature."`
`Rena's eyes grew harsh.`
`...It took a lot to get Rena mad.`
`As for Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun... They were sniffling, fighting back tears.`
`...We heard another tremendous noise from the mitt.`
`...I turned around... and this Left-Arm Kameda-kun guy was looking at us and grinning boldly...!`
`"Anyway... that's how it is.`
` ...Now that it's come to this, we have no choice.`
` We have to engage in real battle!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Looks like... we have to get serious!!"`
`"Yep, and then.`
` ...We tried getting serious.`
` But then... Mii-chan went out with a bang..."`
`Mion, embarrassed, scratched her head—then a moment later doubled over in pain.`
`"Went out with a bang... But how on earth did she end up getting injured like this...?"`
`"It would take a really long time to explain...`
` ...The one thing I can say is that she came up empty even though she pushed herself that hard."`
`"...Mgh...`
` I risked my life... and I couldn't even get one point..."`
`"...Our secret plan did nothing, and now we're very sad."`
`I couldn't even imagine what sort of secret plan it was... but it must have been crazy enough to get her that badly hurt.`
`"...Still, though.`
` We're still playing baseball thanks to you failing, right?"`
`"Ahahahahahaha...`
` Yep.`
` ...Maybe Mii-chan's last resort wasn't very baseball-like, I think.`
` ...I think."`
`"We have no other recourse now, do we?`
` It means that we need to settle the score front and center, in a manner befitting a baseball game!!"`
`"That's right!`
` We have to settle it like baseball!`
` Ah-hahahahahaha!"`
`...I think normal people...`
`Would have given up and gone for a frontal attack...`
` But as a member of our club, I wasn't about to accept that so easily.`
`"...Like baseball? I don't know.`
` ...If we look at it like a baseball game, then...`
` we can't be picky, can we...?"`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` Hmm, it is our club's creed, after all☆."`
`"That's correct!`
` We can't be picky—that's the virtue of our club. Oh-ho-ho-ho!"`
`Rena and Satoko laughed to each other delightfully.`
`...It wasn't really a virtue we could brag about, but the best thing about our club was that we never rolled over and gave up.`
`"...But the cameras are all watching very closely, so it will be hard to cheat."`
`Rika-chan spread her arms wide, indicating the array of reporters in the bleachers.`
`...She was right.`
`With all those cameramen watching us through those cameras with giant telephoto lenses...`
` ...foul play would be fairly tough.`
`"That's right.`
` ...That's the bottleneck.`
` ...Everyone's eyes are on us—we can't be too bold.`
` ...Owwww..."`
`"...I never did think Mii-chan's ways were very ladylike, though."`
`Satoko and Rika-chan both nodded behind Rena.`
`"Then let's get down to business.`
` ...Our team is down one run right now."`
`"Plus, it's the bottom of the ninth... and we already have two outs."`
`"...If this old man's plan had gone better... we'd have our bases loaded right about now...!"`
`"There is no point lamenting a failed plan!`
` Our club never loses heart, and always goes on to the next one!!"`
`Satoko said eagerly, trying to cheer up the downcast Mion, whose secret plan had failed!`
`It may have failed, but Satoko still seemed to have another...`
`"Satoko, you seem pretty cheerful.`
` ...Which means... you've got something up your sleeve, eh...?"`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Who do you think she is?`
` It's Satoko-chan, you know.`
` Satoko Houjou-chan!"`
`...That was right.`
`We called her Trapmaster Satoko, didn't we?`
`She would ensnare her opponent at the perfect moment: the very end.`
`Everyone in our club knew that we could never, ever let our guards down against Satoko!`
`"...I may have taught her, but she's grown a lot and doesn't seem to want to stop.`
` Sometimes even I'm astonished at how she overcomes such slim margins."`
`"...By the way, Mii bats next, then Satoko."`
`We were losing by one point, so if we could get the next runner on a base...`
`...then the runner after that could hit a big one and end the match...`
`And that final batter was Satoko...?!`
`"Uhuhuhuhu...!`
` See?`
` You feel like we can win now, right?"`
`"...I can't imagine what she's got set up, but it's got to be some kind of trap for sure.`
` ...If I were the opposing pitcher, I'd definitely walk her."`
`There was no way Satoko was going to hit a home run, even in my dreams.`
`...But if she was going to stand in the batter's box normally, without any kind of plan, I can't think of anything else she could do!`
`"And the fact that you called me here...`
` I see.`
` I think I know where this is going..."`
`...It meant that I was a necessary piece of Satoko's trap!`
`"I'm excited!`
` I wonder what Satoko will do. Will do!"`
`"...I can't wait to see Satoko's walk-off home run either."`
`"Kei-chan is indispensable for this.`
` ...Understand?!`
` This is our last chance at creating an upset.`
` We absolutely cannot fail!"`
`"Right!`
` That much I know for sure!!`
` Just watch!`
` Satoko and I will give you all front-row seats to the greatest turnaround victory of all time!!"`
`"Then I'll explain your instructions, Keiichi-san.`
` Lend me your ear for a moment."`
`Satoko and I huddled up in a hidden place... and held a briefing that anyone watching could tell was suspicious.`
`"...I wonder what Maebara-san and Houjou are talking about."`
`"...I pray it's not some crazy trick like the one the president used..."`
`Our teammates, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun, seemed very nervous.`
`Rena gave them a wide smile, trying to dispel their anxiety.`
`"It'll be okay, everyone.`
` ...Satoko-chan and Keiichi-kun will be able to pull this off for us!"`
`"But Ryuugu-san, we're up against a Koshien pitcher...!`
` I don't know if Satoko's traps will be much good..."`
`"Hu-hu-hu...`
` Now, everyone, be silent and watch!`
` ...You're gonna get to see an interesting game.`
` Hu-hu-hu-hu!"`
`Mion, who knew everything about to transpire, looked like she was having a hard time stifling the laughter bubbling up within her.`
`...She was so terrifying as an enemy, but so reliable as an ally!`
`Mion waved her hands at the umpire.`
`"We've got a pinch hitter!`
` I, Mion Sonozaki, am switching out with Keiichi Maebara."`
`"...Are you sure he'll be all right?"`
`The umpire turned an uneasy gaze on the pinch hitter who had jumped in with a golf club.`
`"Uhuhuhuhu!`
` Don't underestimate Keiichi-kun, now~"`
`The members of our club were the only ones grinning with wholehearted confidence.`
`Satoko's plan... was definitely simple... but scrupulous.`
`It even looked like the entire situation had gone according to her calculations.`
`...The fact that we were losing by one point.`
`The fact that I had come late.`
`The fact that Satoko was the last batter.`
`...It even felt kind of like this had been set up before the game started.`
`There had been a long timeout since I got here...`
`And during that time, the opposing pitcher, Kameda-kun, took a bathroom break—even that felt calculated.`
`...No—this is Satoko we're talking about, so maybe...`
` Maybe she gave him a laxative somehow, calculated to get him to use the bathroom at this exact moment.`
`And while he was a long way off, shut up in the bathroom... our plan would begin.`
`The opposing pitcher, Kameda-kun...`
` There he was.`
`In front of the urinal... pleasantly taking care of business.`
`He thought it was only natural he would win at a grass-lot game like this... and relaxed enough to relieve himself without a care in the world.`
` ...Maybe that's how he wanted to appear.`
`However... his relaxed state was itself our chance.`
`...Right now...`
` you've already... conceded to our club!!`
`I, too, casually walked into the bathroom.`
`...There were three urinals.`
`Kameda-kun was doing his business at the farthest one.`
` ...I went to the one next to him.`
`...Normally, you would leave one urinal open.`
`Kameda-kun seemed to notice me—I had stood right next to him, after all.`
`"...What—look who it is, the big pinch hitter!`
` Hu-hu-hu...!"`
`He recalled seeing me swing the golf club around like an idiot, and he couldn't seem to resist the urge to laugh.`
`...I, however, wasn't frustrated in the slightest.`
`The match had already been won the moment I arrived.`
`...The game had been decided as a big upset for our team...`
`So now, all I had to do was push things along exactly how Satoko planned.`
`...Hu-hu-hu!`
` I'm the one who should be laughing...!`
`"...I wonder if Keiichi-kun can do it."`
`"He will be fine.`
` When Keiichi-san is serious... he can do this much before breakfast!!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun, our underclassmen, asked another question with much trepidation.`
`"...Um... Is Maebara-san... really going to be able to beat that pitcher...?"`
`"Ah-hahahahaha!`
` ...You don't feel any confidence in Kei-chan after being in the same class with him? `
`...Someday, he could be strong enough to control all of humanity.`
` ...Join Kei-chan... and you could easily rule the world!`
` Hu-hu-hu!!"`
`"T-The world?!"`
`Our teammates exchanged glances!`
`Did Maebara-senpai... really have such incredible strength...?!`
` J-Just what kind of strength could that be?!?!`
`My question caused Kameda-kun to stare in bewilderment, and for a moment, he didn't know what to say.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I don't think I heard you right.`
` ...Could you say that again...?"`
`I smiled thinly, looked straight ahead, and said it once more, clearly.`
`"I'll say it one more time.`
` Let us win."`
`...R-Right to the point!!`
`No threats, or beating around the bush, or anything!`
`...Kameda's brain couldn't figure out the meaning of what I'd said, and I could clearly tell he was confused.`
`"W-What are you, some kind of moron?!`
` Let you win?!`
` Are you insane?!"`
`"...I've relayed our demands.`
` What's your reply?`
` Yes?`
` Or no?"`
`"It goes without saying!`
` Like hell I'll let you win!!`
` Is your brain broken?!"`
`Kameda didn't hide his bewilderment.`
`...He didn't want to be around someone who would babble on like this for another second...!`
`Those thoughts spilled into his expression, and he quickly moved to leave the bathroom...`
`"...Kameda-kun.`
` What does victory mean for you?"`
`"That's a dumb question!`
` Priceless, absolute... supremacy!`
` Nothing else can change it!"`
`He grinned lightly as he answered as if to make fun of me.`
`"...Hu-hu-hu.`
` How like a sportsman to say that.`
` Victory decides all.`
` No one can change that.`
` ...Hu-hu-hu!"`
`"Of course not!`
` No matter what kind of threats or bribes you come to me with, there is nothing valuable enough to make me abandon victory!"`
`I was waiting for those words.`
`I... after spinning around three and a half times...`
` pointed right at Kameda's face!!`
`"Then don't you think you should ask?!`
` Something worth abandoning your precious 'victory' for...`
` What kind of compensation you could be given!!"`
`"W-What are you saying, stupid?!`
` There's nothing... nothing that could make me do that!!"`
`...Hu-hu-hu!`
`He was denying it, but he stopped.`
` ...He stopped!`
`He... was waiting.`
`He was waiting... for me to present some attractive conditions!!!`
`"...In a magazine interview, you said your favorite foods are grilled meat, and that you don't like sweets...`
` ...but you lied about that, didn't you?"`
`"Wha...... what...?!"`
`"For example... let's say you went to a grilled meat buffet.`
` What, exactly, would be on your plate?`
` ...Pork loin?`
` Korean barbecue?`
` A pile of beef tongue?`
` ...Ku-ku-ku.`
` That wouldn't be it. `
`You wouldn't bring meat with you.`
` ...It would be all the pudding and gelatin and cake you could eat!!`
` The kinds a girl would love... pretty, cute, and sweet...`
` You love Western treats like that, don't you?!?!"`
`Kameda's face turned utterly pale.`
`...Our club already knew that he ate a mountain of desserts when he went to the grilled meat buffet.`
`And we were well aware of his embarrassment at his weakness for sweets despite his age!`
`...Kameda-kun couldn't possibly have known that the particular grilled meat buffet chain in Shishibone was owned by a member of the Sonozaki family.`
`(I'll have to be careful when I go out to eat with my parents from now on...)`
`"N-No!!`
` I love the hearty, bone-in—"`
`"No!!!`
` What you like is gentle, soft cute piles of desserts topped with colorful creams!!`
`It almost... makes you think of a girl... adorned in frills and ribbons, pure, ignorant of shame... Cute desserts, like those girls, so clear and clean... `
`And with your acne-laden face, your sports cut, and your lust in full display, you sully them!!`
` Crunch, crunch, munch, munch!!"`
`"Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!"`
`"That's right!!`
` You eat desserts—but you don't love them!!`
` You just dirty them,`
` violate them,`
` and chew them!!`
` All you do... is relish in the enjoyment of soiling them!!!"`
`"Gyaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!`
` Please, no more!!`
` My secret!!`
` My secret pleasure has been found out!`
` I can't go on living!!`
` I have to... I have to die!!!"`
`"You idiot!!! Don't end your life so easily!!!"`
`Ker-slam!!!`
`I hit him on the side of his head as hard as I could!!`
`Kameda-kun fell down like a girl... His eyes started watering, and he broke down.`
`"...Uuu.`
` I'm probably the only one in the world who thinks those things while eating desserts...`
` I'm nothing but a... a pervert, pretending to be a proper sportsman..."`
`"That's right.`
` You're a pervert!!!"`
`"Giiyaahhhhhhhhh...!!!!"`
`Bshweeeeee!!`
`This time I didn't hit him.`
` ...Instead, I clapped my hands down onto his shoulders!!!`
`"Do not cry, Kameda!!`
` What's wrong with a man being a pervert?!?!"`
`Dun-Dunnnnnn!!!`
`"...Eh............ huh...?"`
`"A man ought to be a pervert!!`
` But admitting it sets a man apart from those below him!!`
` You've been honest to yourself!!`
` You can brag about that!`
` You can be arrogant about it!!`
` You can be proud of yourself!!"`
`Instead of blaming him, I told him to have pride in himself... and Kameda-kun couldn't hide his confusion.`
`"Yes!!`
` I have been deeply moved by what you've shown me!!`
` Desserts are nothing but sweet foods eaten after meals...`
` That's what I'd thought this whole time!!`
` But I was mistaken!!`
` And you showed me that!! `
`Thanks to you, I... I can...!!`
` Starting tomorrow, I will be able to enjoy my desserts in a completely different way.`
` For example...`
` strawberry shortcake!!"`
`S-Strawberry shortcake.`
` ...Gulp.`
` ...Kameda's throat cried out.`
`"The simplicity of strawberry shortcake...`
` Indeed!`
` It's somehow old-fashioned... like the orthodox maids from the gaudy times of the late 1800s!!`
` Not those flirty maids with short skirts we have now! `
`An orthodox, fully-dressed, authentic maid!!`
` It's just strawberries... but please, master, I could not prepare any more than this, so please give them a taste... that kind of honesty is unbelievably great...!! `
`Please give them a taste... mm...`
` I-It's such a turn-on!!!"`
`"...A-A turn-on......"`
`"Because there are only strawberries, the soft, accented cream decoration ends up... looking like frills, laces, and embroidery... `
`And she takes it, and splits it with her fork for her master, an elegant aristocrat...`
` No, no!! It would be wilder if she took it and sucked on it vulgarly, like her bad master in his greasy sweat?! `
`N-No, more than that... gulp!`
` The... the dent in the strawberry after plucking it... isn't that even better?`
` And you let your tongue crawl over it... ah?!`
` What kind of taste must that be?!`
` Hah, hah...☆"`
`"T-The dent... a-after you pick the strawberry...!!!"`
`"I... I can't hold it in anymore...!!`
` I'll go to Angel Mort on the way home and make a shortcake into my plaything all I want... hu-hu-hu!!`
` The girls, dressed up beautifully, just for me... uhee-hee-hee!! `
`I draw ever closer to the trembling maidens, and then, one by one... I show them... hu-hu-hu!!!`
` For every one I eat... I hold my jaw tight, just like this, and appraise the goods... wondering which to eat next...`
` Hu-hu-hu!"`
`(Please translate "girls" as "cake," all right☆?`
` Keiichi-kun seems to be talking about cake combination platters (emphasis mine))`
`"...As if I'm showing off...!!`
` I hold my jaw... tight like this... and... g-gulp!!!"`
`Has there ever been a man such as this who could speak so passionately about a single piece of strawberry shortcake?`
`No, there has not!`
`There has never been, I say!!`
`Such passionate feelings... are trying to melt away the stubbornness in Kameda's mind...!!`
`"Kameda.`
` I'll say it one more time.`
` Let us win."`
`"...Um...`
` B...`
` But... that would......"`
`"Then fine.`
` I won't rely on you!!"`
`I rejected Kameda outright and turned on my heel.`
`"Enough, we've lost this game! It's over!`
` I don't care about it anymore! `
`Instead... once this game is over...`
` why don't I head down to Angel Mort and get all-you-can eat of gothic lolitas, decorated like western dolls in frills and ribbons?!`
` Guh-hya-hya-hya!!`
`Tonight... will be the greatest feast I have ever known!!!"`
`"L-Lolitas...`
` A-`
` All you can eat!!!"`
`Thud!!`
`Despite this being the bathroom, Kameda-kun put both his hands on the floor.`
`"Ugh, mmmgh...!`
` I-I was wrong!!"`
`"What's wrong, Kameda-kun?`
` If you have something to say, then say it!"`
`"This is... this is the first time I've met someone... someone like you...!!`
` Until now, I've always thought something was wrong with me... and I had to have fun secretly..."`
`"What are you waiting for, you tiny man?!`
` I already said!!`
` Admitting your perversion is what separates the boys from the men!!!`
` You are a man entitled to pride!!`
` Now!!`
` Reach out your hand!!`
` And show me how great you really are!!`
` Come with me... and accept that it is our world!!!!"`
`"...Uhh...... uuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"`
`Claaaaaaaap!!!!`
`Kameda-kun was crying tears of gratitude, unable to speak... That was the moment we exchanged the most zealous handshake the world has ever known.`
`The handshake of the bond of our souls...`
` ardent, and intense,`
` tight, and steadfast...`
` For a long time, we remained that way.`
`It was an enthusiastic handshake... as though we were two brothers separated at birth, embracing each other tightly as though it would give us back the time we had spent apart.`
`That was the moment the man who would pass into legend for eating so much during Angel Mort's all-you-can-eat dessert day that he was banned from the restaurant forevermore was born...`
`He would eventually write in his autobiography that our meeting this day was fate.`
`...But none of that had anything to do with this...`
`"Then, until later.`
` ...For now, just play the game the way I described it."`
`With just that, I turned on my heel and made to leave the bathroom.`
`But then Kameda-kun stopped me.`
`"...Wa... Wait!`
` At least... t-tell me your name...!!"`
`"Who, me?`
` ......My name is Keiichi Maebara...`
` No..."`
`...I kind of didn't feel like using my real name.`
`...Anyway... maybe I should lie to him and use a codename...`
`"...Just call me...`
` K."`
`"K... K.`
` ...Kaayyyyy...!!"`
`...W-Wait, was that actually an embarrassing name...?`
`...I left the bathroom behind me at a quick pace, hiding my embarrassment.`
`...But from what I heard later, I apparently looked quite gallant coming out like that...`
`"Satoko to Keiichi-san.`
` How did things go?"`
`"Keiichi to Satoko.`
` Negotiations successful.`
` We settled on he and I getting all-you-can-eat dessert at Angel Mort.`
` Mion, no problem, right?"`
`"Two guests for Angel Mort's all-you-can-eat dessert.`
` Roger that.`
` I'll set it up!"`
`"...I am actually quite interested in how you negotiated with him."`
`"They... had a really fun talk about how delicious dessert is, probably! Probably! Hau!"`
`After that, the game started again.`
`I entered the batter's box as a pinch hitter in place of Mion.`
`But... all of the pieces were already in place...!`
`Vroooooooooooooommmm!!`
`The straight pitch whipped by me like a bullet, true to its name.`
`The camerapeople raised their voices in wonder and clicked their shutters.`
`"A sharp pitch, as always!"`
`"He's really going places this summer, isn't he?!"`
`"That golf club pinch hitter is standing straight up too—hee hee!"`
`"...But... doesn't Kameda-kun look a little strange?"`
`"It's like he's got a cold sweat..."`
`I patted my shoulders with my bat, then sneered at him in a relaxed voice.`
`"What's wrong, Kameda-kun?`
` Not feeling well today?"`
`"......Guh...!"`
`"I couldn't swing at the ball because I was too busy laughing at it! Was that all you got?"`
`"...Grr... you little...!!"`
`Vrrrrooooooooooommmm!!!`
`The next pitch... with the same incredible speed as before, it curved sharply, and should have thrown off the batter's skill.`
`...But Keiichi didn't move at all.`
` He just watched coolly.`
`"You don't need any little tricks on a straight pitch, Kameda-kun.`
` Do people fall for those curves a lot?`
` Batters around here, that is?`
` ...Hu-hu-hu!"`
`"......Mgh...!"`
`Both the reporters and all the people watching... noticed something was strange here.`
`...Was Ooshima's Kameda, the pitcher who conquered Koshien... losing the mental battle?!`
`The next straight pitch had incredible speed again, but it went a little wild—it was a ball!`
`I snorted, not even bothering to get ready for it.`
`"...What, Kameda-kun?`
` Scared of going right down the middle?`
` Everyone calls you the best... You'd never walk the batter!"`
`"......Sh-Shit..."`
`Murmur murmur murmur...`
`The abnormal, unexpected situation spread confusion throughout the reporters.`
`"...Wha...`
` What is he...`
` Who is this Keiichi Maebara...?`
` How can he be so relaxed when faced with that supreme fastball?!"`
`"H-Hmph—he's just bluffing. He knows he can't win.`
` Kameda would never throw a ball that an insincere guy like that could hit..."`
`"...No, I don't think it's a bluff.`
` ...They say that at a high level, you can see right through others.`
` ...Kameda is, without a doubt, one of the best.`
` Which must mean...`
` he can see through to that mysterious man's true value..."`
`A really businessperson-looking guy took off his sunglasses and gazed upon Keiichi...`
`"...Huh...`
` Uh...`
` I-Is this...`
` Could it be...?"`
`The idiot pinch hitter who came in cheering them on with a golf club... was actually a genius?!`
`"...I'm sure baseball has long since lost its charm for him, and now he's trying to switch over to golf..."`
`"A genius slugger, making a transfer into the golf world..."`
`W-What a tremendous loss for baseball!`
` Stop the presses!`
` We're changing up our sports columns!!`
`Vrrroooooooooooooommmm!!`
`"B-Ball!!`
` ...Now it's a full count...!`
` Murmur murmur murmur...!!"`
`This excessive production was, of course, all being dramatized by Satoko.`
`The big shots constantly had their eyes on Kameda-kun.`
`If he were to lose easily, they knew the match would have to have been fixed.`
`...Perhaps she wanted this little play of ours to create a mood where it wouldn't be strange for Kameda-kun to lose, but...`
`"...Satoko.`
` Isn't... isn't this going too far?"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho!`
` Do your best, now, Keiichi-san!`
` Today, this game—tomorrow, all of baseball!!"`
`I-I don't want any scouts actually coming after me!!`
`I'm terrified of what would happen when the jig is up...`
`Wait, I can't be making nervous faces right now!`
`"Ball!!`
` Base on balls!"`
`"...Have you gotten scared, Kameda-kun?!`
` I thought you were better than this!!!"`
`Kameda-kun hung his head in (feigned) dejection.`
`(K-san... I did all this according to plan, right...?!)`
`(Yeah.`
` Well done, Kameda-kun!`
` Keep going like this for the next batter...!!`
` Let's wrap this thing up, and then... ku-ku-ku-ku☆!!)`
`(Hah, hah☆. We'll go get all-we-can-eat~!!)`
`Grin!!`
`Kameda-kun and I exchanged evil smiles!`
`For some reason, there were a lot of camera flashes right then.`
`...It seemed like our dear journalist friends took it as two worthy rivals smiling to acknowledge each other's strength.`
`As I trotted over to first base, the camera flashes continued almost to the point where they were annoying...`
`When I got to first base, one of the reporters came over for an interview.`
`"M-Maebara-kun.`
` ...Do you plan on settling the score with Kameda-kun in Koshien...?!"`
`Ugh... Things seemed like they were about to get too big for me.`
`Maybe I should just be honest and confess that I'm not really into baseball...`
`"...Koshien?`
` I've never been interested in Japanese baseball.`
` Sorry."`
`W-Whoaaaahhhh!!`
`This man... Right from the start, he was always aiming for the world!!`
`He might become Japan's first ever big-leaguer!!`
`What...?`
`U-Umm...`
` The conversation was getting fantastically out of hand...`
` Oh, I don't care anymore...!!`
`I'll strike a guts pose for the cameras in desperation...`
`"Yes!`
` Kei-chan got on base, just as planned!!"`
`"Next... Satoko-chan is at bat!!`
` What will she do?`
` What will she do?!"`
`"All right then!!`
` Time to get that walk-off home run and win it all~!!"`
`Satoko stepped up to the plate, waving the bat around.`
`...The reporters couldn't hold back their laughter—maybe because they had just seen his battle with me.`
`"Maebara-kun finally got on base, but now it's all over..."`
`"I see—so this is why Kameda-kun intentionally walked him.`
` He didn't even fight it—he waited for an easier opponent for the final out!"`
`"...But to avoid a direct confrontation like that... We cannot make light of him!`
` That Keiichi Maebara!!"`
`"All right!`
` Come on now, Kameda-san!!"`
`"Hu... Pfahahahaha!`
` You makin' fun of me?`
` Who do you think I am, anyway?!`
` K-sa—no!`
` Maebara-san was one thing... but you think I'll lose to the likes of you?!"`
`"Whenever this girl stepped up to bat, she had swung wildly and missed, striking out every time."`
`"...This might sound rude, but however much Kameda-kun holds back... I don't think she'll be able to hit a home run."`
`I could hear the reporters declaring that there was no way a comeback would happen.`
`Wait, what?`
`...Satoko... she swung wildly and missed every single time she stepped up to bat...?!`
`Vrrrooooooooooommm!!!`
`She swung after the sound had ended, completely mistiming it.`
`I could hear disappointed voices coming from those rooting for Hinamizawa.`
`...It's only natural.`
`Every single batter has struck out.`
`Even if worse came to worst... no one would get a hit.`
`And that's why it didn't sound strange when Kameda-kun said this.`
`"...I can't take it seriously with someone like you.`
` I'll give you a chance.`
` I'll throw the next one slow and underhanded.`
` I'll let you get a hit or two so you can go home and brag to mommy...!!"`
`Of course, these lines were all part of the plot too.`
`...From out of the corner of his eye, Kameda-kun gives me a look...`
` Was that all right?`
`(Yeah.`
` You did great. It looked very natural!`
` Kameda, you are a splendid actor...!)`
`(No, no, compared to K-san, I'm nothing... gu-hu-hu-hu!)`
`Even that exchange was seen as heated and enthusiastic by the reporters.`
`(But K-san...`
` However slowly I pitch... can this girl really hit it?)`
`(...Don't worry, and throw the ball like we planned.`
` I think I've got a good idea of how this'll turn out.)`
`Our exchange over, Kameda-kun moved from set position into a pitching stance.`
`"Come, then!!`
` Throw your merciful pitch!!`
` I'll hit a huge home run off of it!!"`
`...She had struck out every time she was at bat.`
`When I heard that, my vague ideas became firm beliefs.`
`And out of Kameda-kun's hand... comes a slow, lazy pitch, as though they were playing catch.`
`...Normal people would probably be able to hit it... but for Satoko, who had been striking out the whole time...`
`Just when people started to think that way...`
` the members of our club had already realized that Satoko's trap had begun!`
`It was true.`
`Striking out constantly today had all been laying the groundwork for this moment.`
`...An act...`
` all to make it feel like Kameda-kun letting off the gas wasn't strange at all.`
`Which meant, in other words... that Satoko......`
`Crrrrraaaaaack!!!`
`W-Whoaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` She gooooot it!!`
` Look at it go...!!`
`"I don't even need to run, do I?`
` ...Ohh-ho-ho-ho-ho!!"`
`The super-huge home run Satoko hit... disappeared over the roof of the school...`
`The reporters lost their words at the sight.`
` And then...`
` Roars of applause!!`
`Despite... this being what we'd anticipated...`
` I can't help but stare in mute amazement at the gorgeous home run.`
`Satoko strutted over to first base.`
`"Come on, what are you doing, Keiichi-san?`
` Second base is that way."`
`"Satoko, you... you're really good at baseball."`
`Satoko grinned, showing her fang-like canines, in reply.`
`...Come to think of it, she played baseball a lot with Tomita-kun and the others during lunch, didn't she?`
`...The fact that they always invited her to play... meant she was by no means bad at it.`
`"...And... you purposely struck out all those times...?`
` Since before Kameda-kun even got here?`
` ...Geez, you've really got something for every occasion...!"`
`"I say this all the time, do I not?`
` I only have one trap.`
` And when everything is about to come to a conclusion, it's enough that I don't even have to worry. Ho-ho-ho!"`
`D-Damn it... That sounded kind of cool!!`
`Basically, she was just bragging about hitting the ball...`
` but when Satoko did it, it looked so cool!`
`We crossed home plate in order—me, then Satoko—and completed our walk-off home run!!`
`Our teammates welcomed us back with their blessings.`
`"M-Maebara-san!`
` That was amazing—totally cool!!`
` I never thought it would happen!!!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun praised me.`
`"How about that, Tomita-kun? Okamura-kun?!`
` I turned things around just fine!!"`
`"Rena thinks you were cool too! Good work~!"`
`"Hah! It was nothin'!!"`
`I briskly clapped my hand against Rena's outstretched palm.`
`"Satoko did brilliantly too!!`
` She gave us a spectacular ending~!!!"`
`"Who do you think I am?`
` Ohh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!!"`
`Man... can't underestimate her!`
` Satoko Houjou!!`
`"Kei-chan was great too!`
` ...Winning Kameda over like that...!"`
`"...He is a Magician of Words."`
`"Ahahaha, Rika-chan, I don't think that's a compliment."`
`"But really.`
` Only Keiichi-san could have pulled off such a drastic move!`
` I wouldn't have been able to do it myself.`
` I would very much like you to teach me sometime."`
`"...If Satoko learned such displays of power... That's terrifying to even imagine.`
` I'd prefer it if you didn't mimic me..."`
`After declaring the match over, the umpire came to us.`
`"...Well... I never... You actually won...`
` I-I'm shocked."`
`"We said Satoko could hit it, didn't we?`
` You didn't believe us at all!"`
`The umpire scratched his head apologetically and apologized to Satoko, smiling dryly.`
`"And Keiichi-kun was amazing too, wasn't he?`
` Keiichi-kun is actually the most reliable person here."`
`"Well, when I saw him come in with that golf club... I certainly had my doubts, but...`
` That breathtaking battle against Kameda-kun had me on the edge of my seat..."`
`...Right, that breathtaking farce.`
`I quirked a wry smile.`
`...Not even the Buddha would have realized that while everyone thought this was a fair match, Kameda-kun and I were thinking about our evil dessert-violating ways...`
`"Excuse me, Coach?`
` You remember your promise, do you not?"`
`"Uh, yeah, this is... guess I have no choice.`
` Tahahaha..."`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` We did it, we did it!`
` Keiichi-kun, this means we're having a barbecue meetup tomorrow!"`
`Rena clapped her hands, and we all began to dance with joy.`
`Tomita-kun and our other teammates were jumping up and down too.`
`"W-What's that about?`
` A barbecue meetup?`
` Hey, wait, what on earth are you talking about??"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!`
` We made a promise that if we won today's game, he'd treat us to a barbecue party with all kinds of high-class meats! `
`It wasn't looking good for a while when Kameda-kun appeared, but thanks to Keiichi-san we've won that privilege!!"`
`I see—so that's what this was about.`
`It was certainly not a game we could have lost!`
`"...Irie's big wallet will be so sad, so sad."`
`"You're right about that... But I did make a promise..."`
`"When we eat... we do it without any mercy!!`
` We need to feed our growing bodies, after all!`
` Ahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` All right, everyone!!`
` Tomorrow, we dine like kings~!!"`
`""""Yeaahhhhhhh!!""""`
`All of the members of the Hinamizawa Fighters raised their fists high in the air and cheered.`
`Rika-chan was petting the head of the umpire, who was smiling painfully at the off-kilter remarks.`
`He gave her his head, and looked like he was about to cry.`
`...It looked like the price of victory would be pretty big.`
`"...You beat me.`
` But I have no choice, since I promised.`
` Guess I should go shopping for some meat..."`
`"Coach~ Get some grade A beef like you promised~!`
` We won't forgive you if you buy nothing but vegetables to keep it cheap~!!"`
`"Boo-hoo..."`
`The umpire, whom they were calling "Coach," grinned dryly, crestfallen.`
`...Umpire?`
`Coach?`
`The uniform he was wearing had "Hinamizawa Fighters" written on it.`
`...Oh, so he's not just the umpire... he was actually our team's coach!`
`"Maebara-kun—is that all right?`
` Can I call you that?"`
`"Huh? Uh, yeah."`
`"This comeback wouldn't have happened were it not for you getting on base.`
` Please, come to tomorrow's barbecue. `
` ...No, besides that!`
` Would you please consider joining the team?!`
` If you were with us... we could dominate the whole prefecture...!!!"`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` Coach, Coach! Let's leave that aside for now..."`
`"You should be more worried about your wallet~!`
` Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ho!!"`
`Despite the coach being an adult, everyone seemed to get along very well with him.`
`...Coach, huh?`
`"Pleased to make your acquaintance.`
` I'm Irie, coach of the Hinamizawa Fighters."`
`He extended his hand to me.`
`...I firmly grasped it with my own in reply.`
`"I'm Maebara.`
` Nice to meet you."`
`Then, the coach took his other hand and began to stroke mine softly...!`
`"Mmmm, what smooth hands you have...`
` Such a narrow grain, and you truly take good care of them...`
` Hah~ Silky smooth..."`
`"Uh... huh?!?!`
` H-Hey, wait!"`
`"I must strictly instruct our maids to take this good care of their skin as well...`
` and punish the bad ones who don't~☆."`
`"M-Maids?!`
` W-W-What are you talking about?!?!"`
`"Haa~~...`
` Such velvety hands...`
` I just want to put them to work~...`
` Hahh~~~☆..."`
`The coach's eyes were spellbound... and as his delusions floated through his very own original magical universe, he made a supremely satisfied smile.`
`...How do I put this... Who the hell is this guy?!`
`"Ah-hahahahahaha!!`
` You look so flustered."`
`"Our coach is a little strange.`
` But he's really funny, you know? You know?"`
`I felt like you couldn't measure him by saying "strange" or "funny"...`
`I really didn't think we'd get along.`
` ...Snap!`
`The other self in my mind made a witty retort for some reason.`
`"Come on!`
` Settle down already!!`
` You're making Keiichi-san uncomfortable!!"`
`"...Ha~...`
` Silky smooth~...♪"`
`The coach didn't try to take his hands off mine until Satoko hit him with a three-fold washbucket attack, causing him to faint...`
