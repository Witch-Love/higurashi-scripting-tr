`"Nfu-fu-fu-fu!`
` There it is—ron.`
` Three chun, three dora—mangan with 1500 extra."`
`"What...!`
` What's up with that...`
` How do you have three dora?"`
`"You idiot.`
` You're the one who flipped over another kan dora when you knew Ooishi was in tenpai!`
` That's what you get."`
`"Getting more dora was the only thing I could do after revealing the chun!`
` You can't discard a dora tile after a yakuhai is out.`
` Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`Ooishi grinned meaningfully as his buddies, swearing, began breaking down the walls and reforming them.`
`"...By the way, Ooishi-san.`
` Identified her yet?"`
`"What?`
` ...Oh, the mutilated body in the drainage channel.`
` Any new leads come up?"`
`"Yes, well.`
` You'll have to find proof yourself, though."`
`"You're really something.`
` Who was the deceased?"`
`"Rina Mamiya.`
` Actual name Ritsuko."`
`"Apparently she worked for the Blue Mermaid, a hostess bar on Shishibone Flower Road."`
`"Pfew, that's a nasty place.`
` A young leader of the Sonozakis owns it, yeah?"`
`"...Sonozaki—whoops!`
` So it's related to the S-group.`
` ...That mountain'll be tough to scale."`
`"Rumors say the deceased had been dipping into the protection money and the drug supply.`
` And on a pretty significant scale, too, from what I've heard."`
`"A woman getting her hands on the protection money...`
` Sounds like a man's behind it.`
` Not a lot of women do that sort of thing themselves."`
`"Nfu-fu!`
` Well, he's dead anyway.`
` The body just hasn't been found yet."`
`"About that... Ooishi-san.`
` Her man's apparently alive."`
`"Alive?`
` Then maybe he'll die soon.`
` Vermin usually exterminate other vermin—I think we have a very nice self-cleansing system going on."`
`"Anyway, her man...`
` It's, well... Teppei Houjou."`
`"...Houjou?`
` Who's that?"`
`"...Teppei Houjou.`
` The husband of the housewife who was beaten to death last year in Hinamizawa.`
` ...I heard he disappeared after the incident, though.`
` ...I get it—he was staying at his lover's place, huh?"`
`"......And so the Sonozakis grow ever more suspicious."`
`"Where is he now?"`
`"He was living in a woman's apartment.`
` He must have thought she abandoned him, so he's been searching around shops and other gathering places."`
