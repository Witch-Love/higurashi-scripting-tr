`"I know one thing for sure.`
` Satoko could fend off an entire army division by holing up in this mountain."`
`"I know all about it!`
` Satoko was one of the Soviet military advisors that gave training on traps to that one country."`
`"Stop saying weird things... Somebody help meee~~!!"`
`...How did it come to this? What traps did we fall for, and how did we fall for them?`
`Mion was caught in a profusely thin pitfall she couldn't escape from, and only her head was poking above the ground.`
`Rena's head was completely covered by a tin bucket; she was squirming around in a vain attempt to remove it.`
`...Either of these really were funny, but that's where it ended.`
` At least they had their feet on the ground.`
`"...Kei-chan, what about youuu?`
` Think you can get out of that?`
` Hurry up and get out so you can save this old man!"`
`"Y-You're the one who should be breaking out and saving me, Mion!`
` What do you expect me to do in this freaking bamboo mat?!"`
`...I was wrapped up in a bamboo mat and hanging two meters above the ground.`
`Agh... What was this trap and how did I fall into it?`
` Huh?!`
` It was Satoko!`
`This all started when they suggested that I was unfamiliar with nature, having grown up in the city, and proposed a little exploration on the mountain.`
`"Hmm, but Rena doesn't really know how it is back there either!`
` Rena might get lost.`
` Hau."`
`"The mountain out back, huh?`
` ...I played there a lot when I was little... but I haven't gone there for years.`
` If you get lost out there, things can get pretty dangerous."`
`"You can leave the mountain to us!`
` The whole thing is our playground.`
` Isn't that right, Rika?"`
`"...Meep!"`
`"Oh, I see!`
` How reassuring.`
` We'll defer to you two this time and have you be our tour guides!"`
`"Wait, Keiichi-kun...`
` The summer vacation guidebook says not to play on the mountain because you'll get lost."`
`"...It isn't summer vacation yet, so it's all right.`
` We know the path, so there's no need to worry."`
`"The mountain has always been our playground!`
` Our backyard!`
` We know all the secret paths and shortcuts!"`
`...Yes, both Satoko and Rika-chan knew the path like the back of their hands.`
`Thanks to them, we had our fill of fresh air, gorgeous views, and Mother Nature, the likes of which you could never see in the village.`
`But things got strange partway through!!`
`"Oh, yes.`
` Everyone, I have something to say.`
` From here on, you must follow exactly where I go."`
`"Huh...?`
` What are you talking about all of a sudden?"`
`"...It would be safer to do as Satoko says."`
`"Oh, my.`
` Hey, Mii-chan, look at this.`
` What is it?`
` Should I pull it?`
` Should I?"`
`Suddenly.`
` ...Squeak.`
` ...Crash!!!!`
`When Rena pulled the kite string, a bundle of bamboo spears fastened to a tree branch all came raining down with a clatter right next to where Rena was standing!!`
`"Wahhhh!!`
` Wahhhh!!`
` What is this?!`
` What?!`
` What?!`
` Gyaaa!!"`
`"...That brings back memories.`
` Satoko made this trap in the second semester of second grade."`
`"That was a close one.`
` The tips of the spears are covered in dog poop, so if one of them hurts you, the wound will start to fester."`
`"W-When did this turn into freaking Vietnam?!"`
`...According to Satoko and Rika-chan...`
`...Earlier in elementary school, Satoko had been on a trap-making craze, and set them up along every inch of this mountain...`
`"...Keiichi-kun, maybe... they didn't tell us not to go on the mountain because we'd get lost... but because it was dangerous...?"`
`Mion and I both nodded wholeheartedly at Rena's hypothesis.`
`"Come, now!`
` We are hurrying on ahead.`
` If we do not return soon, it will get dark.`
` If it gets dark, it may even become dangerous for me."`
`B-But you're the one who brought us to this crazy mountain!!`
`Why was an average healthy Japanese boy like me being forced to deal with life-threatening booby traps?!`
`...And then...`
` The very moment Satoko and Rika-chan got just out of sight was when the three of us all got caught in nice little traps together...`
`"...Someone get me out~~!`
` I have to go to the bathroom~~!!"`
`"Never mind that~!`
` Somebody get the bucket off me~!!`
` I can't see in front of me~!`
` Hau~!!"`
`"...Wait, Rena, don't struggle around so much.`
` I-I can see your panties..."`
`"H-Hauuuu!!!`
` You saw?!`
` You saw?!`
` Keiichi-kun, you saw!!`
` Hau~~~!!!"`
`Smash, crash, smash, smash smash crash bash!!!`
`"O-Of course you can see them...!!`
` You may be in a bucket, but you can definitelyâ€”`
` gehah,`
` gohoh!!`
` Gbhbhreh!!"`
`Bucket Rena was using me as a sandbag, and Mion was crying.`
`"...You can't get out of the pitfall? How sad, how sad."`
`"Geez, didn't I already tell you all?`
` You weren't supposed to leave my side!"`
`I finally had an epiphany.`
`...Satoko had been so bent on taking everyone out to the mountain... because she wanted to brag about all the traps she'd set up here over the years.`
`...You could have stopped just at showing them to us.`
` ...I didn't need to experience how it felt first-hand!!`
`Rika-chan pets our three heads in sequence, in an incredibly satisfied mood...`
