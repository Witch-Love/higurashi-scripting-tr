`"This Maebara-kun kid... Will he really be able to save us...?`
` We're up against that elite school's aceâ€”left-arm Kameda-kun!`
` To be able to beat a Koshien-class pitcher... He must be a god...!"`
` Don't you know about Left-Arm Kameda-kun, the high-school ace famous in sports magazines?"`
`"And Kameda-kun just happened to show up to watch the game today."`
`Apparently Kameda attends a fairly well-known school in our prefecture that frequently sent people to Koshien.`
` I'm nothing but a... a pervert, pretending to be a proper sportsman..."`
`"That's right.`
` You're a pervert!!!"`
`"Do not cry, Kameda!!`
` What's wrong with a man being a pervert?!?!"`
`"A man ought to be a pervert!!`
` But admitting it sets a man apart from those below him!!`
` I'll go to Angel Mort on the way home and just gaze at that shortcake until I'm sated... hu-hu-hu!!`
`I draw ever closer to the trembling maidens, and then, one by one... I show them... hu-hu-hu!!!`
` For every one I eat... I hold my jaw tight, just like this, and appraise the goods... wondering who to go for next...`
`"...As if cherishing each one...!!`
` why don't I head down to Angel Mort and get all-you-can eat of those lovely young ladies, decorated like western dolls in frills and ribbons?!`
` A-`
` All you can eat!!!"`
