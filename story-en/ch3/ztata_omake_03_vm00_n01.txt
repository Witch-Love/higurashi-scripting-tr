`"Okay, Kei-chan, let's say it at the same time.`
` One, two, three!"`
`""The main character of the next story will be Shion Sonozaki~~!!""`
` If the rumors are right, I might even get a portrait finally?!`
` Yahoo!!"`
`Personally, I wanted to get a scene of the gas coming in, the villagers spasming and foaming at the mouth one by one before dying—do you all think so too?"`
` Now here are all the new character portraits that debuted in this chapter.`
` You had too many appearances and too much dialogue to be a minor character this time."`
` I don't know if I'll appear in the next scenario, so please root for me!"`
` Next up we have Chie-sensei, who has been around since Chapter 1 but never had a portrait until now~!!"`
` They've had me appear in school scenes ever since the first chapter, but for whatever reason, I didn't have my own portrait.`
` ...I wonder why?"`
` Y-Yes, I wonder!`
`"When I mentioned a restaurant with cute uniforms during the story, it must have meant Angel Mort.`
` And Angel Mort is owned by the Sonozaki family, so..."`
`"...I was scary in Onikakushi, but that wasn't only because it was Onikakushi...`
` it was because my character was the exact same in all three stories, is that it?"`
`"If we think in a general sound novel type of way... sometimes the story branches depending on choices, right?"`
`"So like... if in Watanagashi, you had given the doll to my sister?"`
`"Well... hmm.`
` In Tatarigoroshi... maybe whether you decide to kill the uncle or not."`
` ...I think it branched back when the uncle's lover disappeared because of some trouble and he returned to Hinamizawa."`
` ...If Keiichi-san gave the doll to Mion-san...`
` And if Ooishi-san and my uncle hadn't appeared... would we not have spent our time in peace, without anything happening?"`
` Next time I'll pound nails into you without mercy!!`
` Bang, bang!!!`
`"Sinking a sacrifice into the Onigafuchi Swamp... A ritual sacrifice!"`
`"...A-A sacrifice... Who do we sacrifice?"`
` Someone who dies no matter what happens!`
`"...Uhh...`
` ...When you say 'dies no matter what'...`
` you're talking about me, aren't you?"`
`"Hiya, my name's Uncle Houjou~ (He has no portrait, so I'm standing in☆).`
` I'm so lonely and blue because my lover ran away~♪. `
`Time to go back to Hinamizawa, lock up Satoko-chan, and—hah, hah—raise her into a maid servant~~♪.`
` Oh no, all of a sudden, this arm of mine is glowing with an awesome power☆."`
` Can you put her on?"`
` I wanted to keep it secret for a while longer, but okay."`
` The late-appearing younger sister of twins being popular has been the pattern of things ever since the days of TH♪."`
` Anyway, I've been fired from my main character post for once! `
`"Well, portraits of Kei-chan would be a big waste of disc space.`
` If it couldn't all fit on one disc, there's a pretty high chance he'd be the first one dropped."`
`"With Tatarigoroshi, we're already at the third game in the Higurashi: When They Cry series. `
`This first half presented a lot of strange and exciting mysteries, but starting next time...`
` the mysteries will start to be solved in the second half, marking the start of the Investigation Arc (temporary name)."`
` You'll get too close to the Three Families' secrets, be imprisoned, and then get tortured!`
` You're a shoo-in to meet a violent, unnatural death!!"`
