`To Ooishi-san.`
`There was a call for you from Section 4's Chief Shigeharu.`
`Apparently the slaughtered corpse in the Oujikawa River is related to the S-group, as we thought.`
`We're still verifying what happened behind the scenes, but apparently the deceased filled up dozens of self-created fictional bank accounts to their limits with money from the S-group, reaching around one hundred million yen.`
`It appears there were three or four men with former S-group connections involved in this.`
`They've already disappeared along with millions of yen.`
`The deceased was tortured on that point for information, and she was clearly slaughtered as an example to others.`
`There are apparently some real wizards chasing down the people who disappeared.`
`They're also spreading letters to related yakuza groups not to harbor them.`
`There's still no evidence that Teppei Houjou is one of those people.`
`As far as Chief Shigeharu can tell, he hasn't been told anything.`
` He was her pimp, but she didn't trust him at all, did she?`
`Teppei Houjou has left the apartment in Okinomiya and has returned to his former residence in Hinamizawa.`
