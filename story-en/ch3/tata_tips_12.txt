`Abuse issues regarding Satoko Houjou (URGENT)`
`We propose that Satoko Houjou must be taken into immediate custody based on the items below.`
`1. Family situation`
`Life with adoptive father who recently returned to Hinamizawa has already turned disastrous, and she is currently subject to unendurable physical and mental abuse from the father.`
`2. Child consultation center's response`
`A child probation officer was dispatched yesterday on the 17th from the prefecture welfare office, but because of the '77 case, changed to continued coaching and cautionary action.`
`Unfortunately, the consultation office head does not properly understand the situation.`
`3. Status of concerned child`
`Child already appears to be suffering from an outbreak of something close to neurosis or manic depression.`
`If her unstable pubescent mind is negatively stimulated by stress, it will put her development of a healthy body and mind at risk.`
`This cannot be allowed to continue from a humane standpoint.`
`4. Allegations made to the family court`
`We propose, based on the above items, that Satoko Houjou should immediately be taken into protective custody.`
`She should be secured temporarily under emergency allegations to the family court under Article 28.`
`We request emergency coordination between all related agencies.`
