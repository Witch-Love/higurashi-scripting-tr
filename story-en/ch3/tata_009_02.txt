`The die of fate had been cast.`
`...Reporting to a public agency, which we'd kept being warned could instead result in something far worse for Satoko if we didn't have the evidence first.`
` ...And just... just like that.`
`Had I failed... had I let my emotions get the better of me in that moment?`
`...Maybe I should have stayed silent... and left everything to Mion, since she had been relatively calm.`
`...I remembered the punishment game where we had to badmouth curry, and how me saying anything would have made it worse, and Satoko told us to leave the talking to her.`
`...Maybe it was the same thing here.`
`...I was impulsive, so maybe I should have just shut up and looked at the floor.`
`...But... it was too late to lament it.`
`...The die I had thrown wouldn't be coming back into my hands.`
`All we could do was pray for something good to happen.`
`"...Keiichi-kun... You did everything you could.`
` So... leave it to the teachers now.`
` ...Okay?"`
`"Everything I could...?`
` ...If I really gave it everything I had, if I had really struggled... I would have dragged Satoko out of her home last night and hidden her in some abandoned house. `
`...I didn't, so that means I didn't do everything I could."`
`"......Stop thinking about it, all right?`
` ...You're being a little too persistent, Keiichi-kun.`
` At this rate, you'll collapse."`
`Just leave me alone.`
` ...I left her with those words and stared lazily up at the ceiling.`
`...I wondered if I'd really got Chie-sensei to understand.`
`...Would the public agency intervene... and solve everything within the day?`
`...Would they acknowledge the abuse... and guarantee her safety...?`
`...After lunch break, our afternoon classes were mostly self-study.`
`The teacher came back to the classroom occasionally, but then the phone in the lounge would ring and she'd have a long conversation with the caller.`
`Everyone in class... got the feeling they knew what those phone calls were about.`
`Sensei came trotting back from the classroom.`
`"...I'm really sorry for all the phone calls recently.`
` Let's call it a day.`
` President, please lead the class!"`
`"Everybody stand up!"`
`...It looked to me like Sensei had been wearing a dark expression ever since after lunch break.`
`...It wasn't a very relieving expression.`
`It wouldn't be.`
`...Even if Sensei 100% understood the situation and passionately explained it to the other person... `
`At the end, the child consultation center, as a public agency, would be the ones to decide whether to get her to safety.`
` ...Sensei understood that as well as us... and that's why she looked so unreliable right now.`
`"Kei-chan, let's go home.`
` ...I don't think anyone feels like having the club today."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Mii-chan, it's no fun if someone's not here."`
`...Rena was right.`
`...It was no fun for us... if someone was missing.`
`If the teacher's expression had shown more promise... then maybe we could have gone home more comfortably.`
`...But I...... couldn't let myself feel relieved.`
`...I couldn't be naive and tell myself all I can do is pray, now that the dice have been cast.`
`Just in case... they didn't get her to safety and decided to 'wait and see' again...`
` I'd need to take further measures.`
`...We've asked the people who could do something official already.`
`...Then... there was one more place... that was worth asking for help.`
`.........She might laugh it off...`
` ...or I might be right... and I could be endangering my own life.`
`But... I'd try.`
`"Oh... Mion.`
` Is it okay if I stop by your place today?`
` ...You've got a lot of manga, right?`
` I want to borrow a bunch of them."`
`"Huh...?`
` .........Sure, I guess."`
`There was an ominous meaning behind my words, so Mion realized what I really meant right away.`
`...I wanted to talk about something alone.`
` ...That's what I meant.`
`"Mii-chan, Keiichi-kun!`
` Let's go home~!"`
`Rena already had her shoes on, and was waving to us from the schoolyard.`
`...Mion's house... was gigantic in every way imaginable.`
`The house itself was a vaguely old-fashioned, traditional Japanese house, but the yard, I guess—or their plot of land—was enormous.`
`...It easily convinced me that they really were major landowners, with Hinamizawa under their thumb.`
`Mion brought me through the guest room and a servant brought us some tea.`
`"Wow.`
` You really are rich, huh?`
`"Grandma and I are the only ones who live here.`
` I wouldn't be able to do everything myself."`
`The servant left, telling us it was five o'clock... then withdrew with soft footsteps.`
`"We have people come in to take care of Grandma and clean two or three times a week.`
` They come in rotations of three or four, so there's someone here almost every day.`
` Only until evening, though. `
`Oh, and if we're having a party or something where we need more help, we call up different people."`
`...If you had the money to hire all these people, then just take Satoko in.`
`...I glared at her as I thought that... and Mion seemed to catch on immediately.`
`"......Oh... sorry."`
`"It's fine.`
` ...I know it's not a money problem."`
`"...Just to be clear... My family may be rich, but...`
` It's not money that I can use freely for myself, okay...?`
` I don't want you to misunderstand that..."`
`...It kind of looked like I was bullying her.`
`...Mion had been apologizing to me a lot lately.`
`...Was Mion the sort of person who would do that this much...?`
`Maybe it's just that I've been looking so grim lately...`
`"...So.`
` ...What's up?`
` You had something to talk about, right?"`
`"I have... something pretty serious to discuss, Mion.`
` ...This will be sudden, and you might be surprised... but I want you to hear me out."`
`"Huh... W-What?"`
`"Oh... I'll give you a way out first.`
` ...Even if what I say is true, you don't need to admit it.`
` You're allowed to play dumb.`
` ...But... I want you to listen until the end. `
`......I have something to say to the next leader... of what's still the most important of the Three Families of Onigafuchi Village: Mion Sonozaki."`
`"............"`
`At first Mion looked like she had no idea what I was saying... but at hearing the whole sentence and putting it together, she reacted.`
`"......Where did you hear that?"`
`"...It... doesn't really matter."`
`I definitely couldn't tell her who told me.`
`...Takano-san, you told me not to... but please forgive me.`
` ...This was why I asked you about it, after all.`
`"...I was surprised just that you'd heard of Onigafuchi Village, Kei-chan...`
` but you seem to know a lot of things, both true and false... about me too."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...True and false.`
` ...I really might just have the wrong impression here.`
` But... I'm okay with that, so listen.`
` ...And, if it really is true..."`
`"I don't know what you're getting at, Kei-chan...`
` but let me say this beforehand.`
` ......You've got a big misunderstanding.`
` ...So if it were possible, I wouldn't want to hear what you're about to say. `
`Because even if you said it, I can't do anything to help you.`
` ......Still...`
` If talking about it will lighten your burden even a little, I'll listen.`
` ......I'm only just going to listen.`
` Nothing more will happen. `
`...Are you okay with that?"`
`".........Yeah."`
`Mion... seemed to know what kind of thing I'd be talking about.`
`She warned me that doing so would be fruitless.`
`...That much was obvious.`
`...If what I was going to say was true...`
` then the Sonozaki family...`
` would be... the masterminds behind the string of freak deaths that had been occurring every year in Hinamizawa.`
`"...You know that stuff...`
` about Oyashiro-sama's curse, right?"`
`Mion nodded a little.`
`"......No one knows what it is or why it happens.`
` ...Even if each incident is solved, the string of deaths and accidents as a whole is still a mystery.`
` ...But there's one thing connecting them all. `
`And that's... how the targets are always enemies of the village."`
`".........Seems like it."`
`Mion spoke as if it didn't relate to her.`
`...That was fine.`
`She didn't have to admit it.`
` ...For now... I just wanted her to stay quiet and listen to me.`
`"...The day after tomorrow... it's Watanagashi, isn't it?`
` ...Has the sacrifice for this year's curse... been decided already...?"`
`Mion didn't answer.`
` Her expression remained the same, too.`
`...Like she said... she was just quietly listening.`
`"Er, sorry.`
` ...The promise was that you'd just listen... so it's weird for me to ask a question, huh?"`
`Mion gave me a look she'd never given me before... a faraway look... a sympathetic one.`
`...She didn't nod... she just smiled faintly and listen to me.`
`"If... this year's curse...`
` isn't going to be on Satoko's uncle...`
` then please change it to him.`
` I mean... last year it was her aunt, right?!`
` It's in the right order, so it wouldn't be weird!"`
`"...Ahahaha.`
` You're right, it seems like there's an order."`
`"I mean, after her aunt died to the curse last year, he abandoned Satoko and fled into the town for a whole year!`
` Why wouldn't a guy like that definitely be next on Oyashiro-sama's list?! `
`There shouldn't be any issue with choosing him for this year!"`
`"...I see.`
` If he were to die from the curse this year, no one would see anything unusual about it."`
`"I... I, er... I heard...`
` that Oyashiro-sama's curse is... well..."`
`No matter how I looked at it... I wasn't sure... whether I should continue.`
`...No matter how I tried... the words... wouldn't come out.`
`"The string of freak deaths in Hinamizawa...`
` also called Oyashiro-sama's curse—you're saying they're incidents perpetrated by the village... carried out by the Three Families at the Sonozaki's instructions?`
` Is that it?"`
`"I... I wasn't...!!`
` I don't care one bit whether you have anything to do with it!`
` I'm just saying!!`
` If... If you have any way of communicating with whoever decides the targets of the curse... `
`Then I just want you to tell them... to choose Satoko's uncle...`
` ...Please!!!"`
`"......Everything you've been saying has been terrible.`
` If the freak death incidents in Hinamizawa were carried out by the will of the Sonozaki family... that would mean the main culprit would be me, wouldn't it? `
`I would have chosen the target of the curse,`
` given the instructions,`
` killed many people,`
` and gotten rid of others.`
` ...You're calling me a murderer, Kei-chan."`
`"...I didn't say that!!`
` Didn't you listen to me?`
` ...I don't care whether you're the one behind the murders or not... I just don't!!`
` Even if you were the culprit, it doesn't change the fact that you're my friend!! `
`It doesn't matter at all!`
` If the police were chasing you, I'd come to help!`
` I'd make you an alibi and even help you escape!!`
` Because we're friends and comrades!!`
` Aren't we?!"`
`Mion... looked surprised for a while.`
` ...She was dumbfounded.`
`"............Now you're declaring yourself complicit?`
` Kei-chan, that's pretty bold of you."`
`"Come on, don't interrupt!!!`
` ...Satoko's uncle... Choose him for—"`
`"Stop right there, Kei-chan.`
` ...I want to start on dinner soon, so I'd like to leave things at this."`
`"M...Mion...!!!"`
`I then realized... that my cheeks were wet with tears.`
` ...They slid down my chin and fell, drip drop, to the tatami mat.`
`"......It's like I said at the start.`
` ...You've got a big misunderstanding.`
` ...Oyashiro-sama's curse is just that... `
`Even if there were people behind those incidents, they don't have anything to do with the Sonozaki family, or me either."`
`"...Right.`
` ...I understand that, it's just..."`
`"......It was touching to hear such a desperate plea, Kei-chan...`
` but that was all it was.`
` ...Even if I wanted to help, I can't.`
` ...You understand that too, right?"`
`"......Yeah."`
`"...But now I know how you feel so well it hurts.`
` ...If I really were... like you said, the one controlling the Three Families and choosing the sacrifices every year.`
` ......I'd probably grant your wish."`
`".........Mion...!"`
`"But the reality is different. I'm just Mion Sonozaki.`
`...My family may be the subject of all sorts of bad rumors about controlling Hinamizawa from the shadows,`
` but we have nothing to do with the freak death incidents. `
`...We may have been a little extreme during the dam war, but that's all.`
` ...We would never do something...`
` so insane as to kill people."`
`"...That's...... Don't say such sad things...`
` ...Right now, at least...`
` I don't care...`
` Why can't you just be nice and lie to me...!"`
`"Kei-chan.`
` You're free to believe what you like.`
` If I lied to you now, you'd be convinced Satoko would be freed the night after tomorrow, and you'd be able to shed much of your burden.`
`...However, reality is harsh—Satoko's uncle will survive beyond that day.`
` ...He'd still be alive next week, and the week after that.`
` ...You need to prepare yourself for that. `
`...I don't want you coming to me the day after Watanagashi and demanding to know why he wasn't killed."`
`"............Mion..."`
`Mion stood up slowly and closed the sliding door, to keep out the wind that had grown chilly...`
`"...Was it Miyo-san?`
` Did she give you all those ideas?`
` ...She really likes to misunderstand things about Hinamizawa.`
` ...Well, we can let her have her fun.`
` ...But I don't really want her influencing you, Kei-chan. `
`...Geez.`
` This is why outsiders are no good."`
`"Takano-san... has nothing to do with it."`
`"...Right, right.`
` Don't worry.`
` Even though I know she told you about it, Kei-chan, nothing's going to happen.`
` ...It's not like Miyo-san will be chosen for this year's curse. `
`...Besides, we don't even know for sure if the curse will happen this year.`
` ...Maybe it was all just a pile of unfortunate coincidences."`
`"......Thanks for listening.`
` ......If you aren't connected to the serial deaths at all... then that must have been an uncomfortable conversation.`
` I'll apologize for it."`
`"I see...`
` You'll apologize for it...`
` ...Hahahahahahahaha."`
`...Mion said she didn't have much time, but she still brought me to the gate.`
`She said she had a meeting or something today about Sunday's Watanagashi festival, so there would be a lot of people from the town council and the festival committee coming.`
`...Despite her day being so busy, she still listened to what I had to say.`
`"...If there's a God in heaven...`
` then he probably understands how strongly you feel."`
`".........Yeah.`
` I'm really sorry for being so weird today.`
` ...You can pretend like this discussion never happened if you want."`
`"...Okay.`
` I'll forget about it."`
`"Okay.`
` ...See you tomorrow."`
`"Bye-bye."`
`I had really only spent... a short time with Mion.`
`...Talking to her made me think.`
`...It was clear that what Takano-san had told me, at least, wasn't a complete fabrication.`
`If Mion was really, really unconnected to the incidents, then she probably wouldn't have listened to me so quietly.`
`...She heard me out until I was done without making any quips... and I wanted to think that was proof.`
`...I did kind of feel like I was grasping at straws.`
`Of course, thinking back on it... it was a terrible thing to discuss.`
`I mean, I went to my friend's house, called her a serial murderer, and then told her to kill Satoko's uncle...`
` I was the only one talking that whole time.`
`Mion quietly listened to everything I had to say like a pastor listening to a confession.`
`...She could have gotten angry partway through, told me off, and to go wash my face in miso soup and come back later.`
`...But she didn't.`
`Was that proof that Mion's family, the Sonozaki, were the masterminds...`
` or was she just listening because she felt sorry for me going kind of crazy?`
` ...I didn't know which it was.`
`But... it was the one effort I could make at the moment.`
`It was another form of insurance...`
` should worst come to worst and the public agency decided to 'wait and see.'`
`It was a completely useless resistance... literally grasping at straws.`
`Sensei said that if she reported it to the child consultation center, they'd have to respond on the same day.`
`...Could they already be in the middle of responding to it now...?`
`If Satoko came to school tomorrow morning all energetic... then everything would be just a needless fear.`
`Why couldn't tomorrow come faster...`
`That night was unusually hot and humid... and I couldn't get to sleep.`
`...I said all that to Sensei.`
` ...They couldn't possibly decide to 'wait and see' again this year.`
`Satoko... What was it like for her tonight?`
`...Had she tasted the end of her nightmare, enjoying a night of liberation?`
`I actually put my hands together... and prayed into my futon.`
