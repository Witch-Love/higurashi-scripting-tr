`"...This year's curse, then?"`
`"...That's what it looks like.`
` ...He kills them differently every year, but this is particularly conspicuous, isn't it?"`
`"Clawing out your own throat...`
` ...That isn't normal..."`
`"Let's leave the rest to the old man in forensics.`
` ...I'm sure he'll find some suspicious drugs."`
`"Thank you!`
` Thank you for your hard work!!"`
`"Oh, Ooishi-san!`
` Komiyama-san and the others have arrived!"`
`"Ooishi-san, much appreciated!`
` Well, it would seem we have a pretty crazy one this year."`
`"Yes.`
` We've been outsmarted.`
` ...I was absolutely under the impression Teppei Houjou would get killed tonight..."`
`"Who is the deceased?"`
`"Jirou Tomitake.`
` A photographer with a hobby for coming to Hinamizawa a few times a year.`
` ...We didn't even have him marked..."`
`"...I wonder what happened?`
` Did they realize we were watching the Houjou residence the whole time and decide to switch their target?"`
`".........Maybe...... We sure flubbed this one..."`
`"And there are no problems with Teppei Houjou?"`
`"Correct.`
` His daughter left for the festival in the evening, and a little while later, he left on his motorbike. `
`...His daughter came back first... wait.`
` Has he not come back yet?`
` Is he still out drinking somewhere...?"`
`"Ooishi-san, are you there?!`
` Call from Chief Takasugi.`
` He's on the line in Car 1!!"`
