`He said it smelled.`
`He said the food smelled.`
`He said it smelled because I smelled.`
`He said I smelled because I don't take baths.`
`He said to take a bath three times a day because I was a smelly person.`
`He said I had to stay in the bath for a long time every time.`
`He must be possessed by something too.`
`This is the same thing the man who died said.`
`Why does he know what that man said before?`
`That much is obvious.`
`The same thing that possessed that man is now possessing him.`
`Can't a sudden earthquake make a big hole in front of the house?`
`If it did, he would definitely go and look into it.`
`And then I just have to push him in.`
`I won't give in until I get that chance.`
`I won't give in, I won't cry.`
`I won't give in, I won't cry.`
`Ahh, someone is apologizing again...`
