`Chairman XX,`
` Members of the XX Party,`
` Congratulations are due, as we are celebrating 25 years since our founding.`
`These past 25 years have seen much growth in XX Prefecture.`
`The once quiet scenery of nothing but fields,`
` now has seen the opening of a new stop for the bullet train, `
`and with the development of the highway, we've seen the rebirth of a modern city bursting with youthful energy.`
`We've reaped the benefits of new businesses and industry.`
`And with the special reverence the residents of XX Prefecture have for time-honored traditions-- `
`history and culture, business and industry--with these ideals in harmony, they have accomplished in growing their city into one of Japan's foremost metropolises.`
`Of course, the development of XX Prefecture couldn't have happened without the growth of the XX Party.`
`We are resolved to see every one of our campaign promises to fruition,`
` reaching our targets definitively and expediently like arrows fired from a bow.`
`With these arrows as the fundamental bases of the XX Party, our members have sought to pierce the obstructions preventing the happiness of the residents of XX Prefecture.`
`But I do believe that everybody here is unlike an ordinary arrow.`
`While being as unfaltering and straightforward, we have not neglected in seeking solutions that conform to the current day and age while also keeping an eye on the future.`
`An arrow, once loosed, can only fly to its destination.`
`Everyone here, however, is no simple arrow.`
`Even once loosed from the bow, without neglecting our studies,`
` while employing new methods, `
`and implementing more effective and flexible ideas, thus being able to change trajectories midflight-- we are magical arrows.`
`The modern age marches ever forward.`
`Sometimes it marches faster than the time taken from planning to execution.`
`(The following part was not in the script.`
` It is thought to have been ad-libbed by the Minister.)`
`For example, there have recently been numerous problems with the Hinamizawa Power Plant Project. `
`Rather than forcing through the project solely because it was decided upon by the government, it is necessary to reflect on and adjust to the ever-changing needs of the residents, the region, and the next generation.`
`The protests by the local residents that surround the Hinamizawa Dam,`
` these are also the will of the people of XX Prefecture. `
`If you feel that there is no need to listen because the project has already been finalized, then you do nothing more than shed a poor light on Japan's postwar democracy.`
`(The following is as per the script.)`
`For the lasting happiness of the citizens of Japan and the residents of XX Prefecture, please consider these policies thoroughly.`
`I believe, however, we have all gained something from the flexibility and foresight of the XX Party.`
`I've taken up much of your time,`
` however, allow me to say the following to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our founding.`
`Chairman XX,`
` members of the XX Party in attendance,`
` thank you very much for today.`
`--From the opening remarks of the XX Party Prefectural Forum and 25th Anniversary Celebration.`
