`"Thank you very much for playing Higurashi When They Cry ~Himatsubushi~.`
` Mfu fu fu!"`
`"......Mfu fu~."`
`"My oh my, no matter what anybody else says, I was the star of the scenario this time.`
` On top of that they added some nice jazzy theme music!`
` If you can't laugh here, where can you laugh? Na ha ha ha ha!!"`
`"......Anyways.`
` Hasn't there been too much of you lately, Ooishi?"`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean by that,`
` Rika-sa--"`
`"She meant that literally!!!"`
`"It's rather impudent of you to try and hog the spotlight here, even though you already had all that screentime!!!"`
`"Ah... Ahahaha.`
` Besides Rika-chan who was the main heroine, everybody else didn't really have any appearances, did they☆?"`
`"I heard that this time the scenario was a bit of a side story, but I didn't think that they would leave out the main cast this much!"`
`"You didn't have it so bad, Mion-san.`
` At least you had a few appearances, did you not?`
` Both Rena-san and I didn't even have a cameo."`
`"......Rena still shows up on the covers a lot, so she's still okay."`
`"...Exactly what are you trying to say, then?`
` ...That I was the only outcast with no appearance? Is that it?"`
`"......Nipah~☆."`
`"Bwaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` They only treated me horribly~!!`
` Waaaaaaaa!!"`
`"......How sad, how sad.`
` They'll probably just keep treating you worse and worse, until you finally drop down to a supporting role."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` That's just too much!!"`
`"Th-Th-That's not true...`
` There's lots of people who like Satoko-chan.`
` They won't treat you that horribly. Okay?"`
`"I don't like being treated like thiiiiis!!!`
` Waaaaaah!!"`
`"Ah, ahahaha...`
` I think you'll probably have a lot of appearances next time.`
` Next time!`
` So cheer up, okay☆?"`
`"But...`
` I'd heard that this scenario was supposed to be somewhat of a bonus story...`
` ...But is it really?`
` I think that things kind of got complicated."`
`"......The story was difficult for me to understand."`
`"Yeah...`
` What I found the hardest to believe... was that the year before the string of mysterious deaths, Rika-chan already knew about them..."`
`"...Which means...`
` ...all the incidents were part of someone's scenario...`
` ...That's a pretty important piece of information..."`
`"......It's probably because I'm a shrine maiden, so I knew the future from Oyashiro-sama's divine revelations."`
`"Hmmm...`
` For somebody like me who believes in the theory that it was the work of human culprits, I'd like to deny that."`
`"I believe in the curse... so that Rika-chan--who's the living incarnation of the deity that protects Hinamizawa, Oyashiro-sama--could have that divine power is a possibility, I think."`
`"Ahhhh! Nope. Nope!`
` For someone who thinks it was the work of man, that kind of unfounded fantasy will not stand!`
` All the incidents were caused by people!`
` There's no curse or magic or aimbots or cheatcodes!"`
`"......It would be wonderful if I could use magic, though."`
`"Ahahahaha☆.`
` If it's Rika-chan, I could go along with that. Hau!"`
`"Well, for the people who believe it was the work of humans, the ending was a big revelation!`
` From the first incident until Rika-chan was killed in the Great Disaster, everything was scripted. `
`Knowing that it's all one big incident vastly increases the amount of material you can hypothesize with!"`
`"I think... that the prophecy is proof in itself that Rika-chan has some divine power.`
`In other words, it's proof that there's some mysterious power at work in Hinamizawa.`
` I think it's proof that the incidents weren't the work of humans alone."`
`"......The inside of my head is so muddled I don't know what's going on."`
`"Oh that's right, more importantly...!!`
` That expression that Rika-chan was wearing this time!`
` That was super scary, wasn't it!?"`
`"......Meep."`
`"Yeah, I was surprised, too...`
` I never thought that cute li'l Rika-chan would laugh like that..."`
`"Hey, just for a little bit...`
` Could you show us that face one more time?"`
`"......I don't want to."`
`"I-I don't want her to do that outside of the story...`
` Hau..."`
`"Wha--!?`
` What is this!?`
` A blackout!?"`
`"Nobody move!!`
` Any weird movements, and you'll come face-to-face with a combo trap that takes you from a pendulum to a landmine to an electric chair with a buzzsaw!!"`
`"...Sa-Satoko!?`
` What's the meaning of this!?"`
`"Hooo ho ho ho ho!!`
` We'll now be starting the afterparty for everybody who didn't have an appearance this time!`
` Ooo ho ho ho!!"`
`"Hee hee hee...`
` Thanks for that wonderful introduction.`
` Hello again, everybody."`
`"I didn't think that I'd have an appearance here, of all places.`
` I'm delighted, though.`
` Satoko-chan, thank you."`
`"Whoa, hello everybody~!`
` ....Kya!?"`
`"Oh my, didn't I warn you not to move~?"`
`"...Ryuugu-san, are you okay?`
` Houjou-san, you didn't have to go this far..."`
`"Ohh ho ho ho!!`
` The grudge of somebody not making an appearance is a terrible thing!"`
`"......Satoko had lots of appearances in the main scenario."`
`"The grudge of somebody not making an appearance...`
` Dammit, when was she able to set this many traps...!?"`
`"Maybe, that when this place was selected as the venue for the afterparty,`
` at that point my traps were already set?`
` Ohh ho ho ho!"`
`"...Oh... I know!!`
` There's somebody behind you pulling the strings!`
` There is, isn't there!?`
` Come out!!"`
`"...Heh heh heh heh heh!`
` Hello hello, my sister.`
` How are you doing?"`
`"Oh, it's Shii-chan! Hello~!`
` ....Gyah!?"`
`"......I feel sorry for her falling for the same trap twice."`
`"I thought it was you, Shion!!`
` Even though you're penciled in to be the main character in the next scenario! This is an outrage!`
` Now you've gone and done it!!"`
`"Heh heh heh...`
` Even if it is only the bonus scene before the answer arcs, I can't let my sister have all the appearances. I'm not that generous, you know.`
` Well☆. `
`In any case, I just let Satoko start a little something-something."`
`"...Grrrrrr...!!`
` Shion, what is it that you want!?"`
`"Let's just say I'm securing myself a little safety buffer.`
` The other day, for some reason, you were steadily getting more votes in the popularity poll."`
`"Yup.`
` In the first half of the Watanagashi chapter, there were a lot of people getting infatuated with Mii-chan."`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` When your malicious side made its appearance, all the players finally started noticing my charm.`
` Satoko also earned a good reputation during the Tatarigoroshi arc. `
`Rena and Rika-chan have a strong baseline of support.`
` Your popularity has long since faded away!"`
`"That's why...`
` I thought I'd take the time now to crush you and Satoko, who've been getting too many votes for my comfort.`
` So I came up with this elaborate plan."`
`"...!?`
` Shion-san, what did you say just now!?`
` You're going to crush me as well!?"`
`"...You're a little slow to notice, aren't you, shorty!!`
` Here you go!!"`
`"Wha-wha-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!?"`
`"Heh heh heh heh heh!`
` Goodbye, all you regulars. Hello to all you irregular folk.`
` All the main characters are done for!"`
`"...Shi-Shion-chan.`
` You don't have to go that far, probably..."`
`"Now now, Jirou-san.`
` It's interesting, so just let it be.`
` The number of appearances for the both of us is going to go up, you know?`
` ...Jirou-san...`
` ...Do you not like being by my side?"`
`"Ah... ahahahahahaha!`
` Th-Th-That's not true!`
` Ahaha!"`
`"Chie-sensei~~!`
` Did Shii-chan pay you off too!?"`
`"I-I'm sorry, Ryuugu-san.`
` ...Shion-san said she would make me a new segment called 'Teach me! Chie-sensei' starting from the next scenario... so I just..."`
`"Well then.`
` Who should I dispose of next in a <i>most</i> embarrassing manner?`
` Maybe Satoko, since she helped me set this all up?"`
`"I won't allow that!!!`
` Hiyah!!!"`
`"C-Coach!!"`
`"He seems somehow reliable for once!!"`
`"I, Kyousuke Irie, shall not allow any aggression against Satoko-chan.`
` I may also just be a supporting character... but don't think you can persuade me so easily!"`
`"Oh.`
` Then you're saying you want to withdraw from being the lead in`
` 'Live Performance!! Satoko's Maid Training, Dress-up Chapter'`
` that we planned on filming after this?"`
`"...Shion-sama.`
` I, Kyousuke Irie, shall follow you to the depths of hell!!!"`
`"That was fast!!!"`
`"Well then...`
` With this, I'm holding all the cards!`
` Even in this afterparty scene too!`
` I'll have everything proceed as I see fit.`
` ...Huh?`
` We're missing somebody."`
`"...Shion-sama!`
` Ryuugu-san isn't here!`
` She escaped at some point!"`
`"There she is.`
` Ryuugu-san!`
` Didn't I just tell you you shouldn't move?"`
`"Rena-chan!`
` I won't do anything to hurt you, but it's easier if you don't resist!"`
`"I-- sorry, but all this is really bizarre!"`
`"...What're you trying to do?`
` ...The lightswitches?`
` I see, you're planning to do something when the room's pitch black, aren't you?`
` Hee hee hee... resistance is futile."`
`"Rena-san.`
` You should stop your pointless resistance and just come along peacefully.`
` If you make me angry enough, then not only will you suffer, but so will my dear sister as well."`
`"...You can't do anything just by turning off the lights...`
` ...Rena, I'm sorry, but do what they say..."`
`"It's alright, don't worry.`
` By turning off the lights... we can reverse this situation!"`
`"...Reverse the situation!?`
` ...Exactly... what are you scheming!?"`
`"...Ahahahaha!!`
` Rena-san, you're pretty good at making me laugh.`
` Then why don't you go ahead and try?`
` Show me how you're going to turn this around."`
`"...You're spoiled, Shii-chan.`
` ...Even if you didn't have any appearances in the main scenario, you've had so much screen time during this afterparty... you're spoiled."`
`"When, exactly, are you saying I was spoiled?"`
`"You don't understand, Shii-chan.`
` ...Even if it's just the afterparty, you still have an appearance. You also appeared a lot in the previous scenarios. `
`There's somebody...`
` who resents you from the depths of hell, who can't forgive you...`
` Listen... can't you hear it, Shii-chan?"`
`"...Th-That's right!`
` I understand now!!"`
`"I get it!!`
` Kei-chan!!`
` That's right, he never has any appearances during the afterparties!`
` There's no way Kei-chan would allow somebody to monopolize the afterparties all to themselves without him!"`
`"I see.`
` So?`
` How is Kei-chan going to appear here, when he doesn't even have any character art?`
` ...It couldn't possibly be that they'd insert new character art just for this.`
` Heh heh heh!!"`
`"That's just your self-centered way of thinking, Shii-chan!!"`
`"...Gah!!`
` No!!`
` If the lights are turned off...!!`
` Chie-sensei, hold Rena-chan back!!"`
`"Huh?`
` Huh?"`
`"It's too late!!!!"`
`"...Save meeeeeeee!! Keiichi-kuuuuuuuuun!!!!!"`
`"...Kukukuku...`
` Uwaaa ha ha ha ha ha!!!!"`
`"Th-That voice is... Kei-chan!?!?"`
`"Rena, you have my thanks!!`
` When even the moon abandons the land and shrouds it in true darkness,`
` The Demon Lord of the Darkest Black, Keiichi Maebara, shall appear!!!!"`
`"I see, if it's like this, he can appear even if he doesn't have any character art."`
`"...There's no character or background art, so it's really easy on the production staff."`
`"Bwa ha hahahaha!!!`
` Shionnnn!!`
` You act like you're the main character in a tragedy, but from my point of view, it's more like a comedy!!!`
` It seems like you've gotten a little carried awaaaay!!`
` Every. Afterparty. `
`Without any character art, without any sort of appreciation. Witness my`
` anger,`
` my grudge,`
` and all of my sorrow!!`
`I shall instill it all upon you!!!"`
`"...I-It almost seems like Keiichi-kun is doing some sort of bad-guy transformation sequence."`
`"This isn't some sort of transformation. I'll have you know I've always been a Demon Lord!!`
` And as of right now, this world which is enveloped within true darkness shall dance upon the palm of my hand!! `
`Within this world of darkness, there are none who can oppose me!!!!"`
`"...Keiichi-kun is kind of scary... hau..."`
`"Scary?`
` Wa ha ha ha ha!!!`
` The age of the frightening Higurashi has come to an end!!`
` From here on out begins the dawn of a perverted and cutesy Higurashi!!!!"`
`"...Wha-Wha-What did you say!?`
` Maebara-sama!`
` Bring me with youuuu!!"`
`"Gahahaha!!`
` You know it, Coach!!`
` Then, as a first step, I'll show our doctor-cum-coach my power.`
` Hrnnnnnggaaaaaa!!!"`
`"...Kya!?`
` Wh-What is this!?"`
`"Ta-Ta-Takano-san is in a mini-skirt nurse outfiiiiit!!`
` And it's not some pink one like you'd find in a galge!`
` He knows what he's doing!!`
` It's a proper pure and innocent whiiiite!!"`
`"Even though she's a nurse, she doesn't appear in the outfit even once during the main scenario, you've got to be kidding me!!`
` Well then.`
` ...On to the next target...☆"`
`"...Re-Renaaaa!!`
` This hasn't changed the situation at all!`
` It's just turned into a different type of crisis!!!"`
`"Hau~!!`
` I can't do anything in this darkness~~!"`
`"Now then, who should I make wear what next~?`
` Maybe a nice`
` school uniform`
` gym clothes`
` school swimsuit triple combo!?!?"`
`"Maebara-sama, you're the best~~!!!!!`
` How about a bunny girl, or campaign girl costu-- no no, lingerie could be good too!! `
`No, wait!!`
` How about just about making everybody naked!!!`
`B-But of course, leave the socks on!!!"`
`"Whoaaaaaaa!!`
` That's a good idea!!`
` You know your stuff!!`
` C-Coach...!!`
` I feel like we're finally seeing eye-to-eye here!!!"`
`"Wait, Maebara-san.`
` ...No, K.`
` Call me Iri from now on.`
` Call me Doctor Iri!!!"`
`"KeeeeEEEeei!!`
` You can't forget about us!!"`
`"Mfu fu!`
` Tommy and Cloud are already on your side, K!!`
` Nfu fu fu!!"`
`"Tommy!!`
` Cloud!!`
` ...We're all finally here...`
` The Elite Four have arrived!!!"`
`Finally.`
` ...With K at their head, the evil Elite Four made their grand entrance.`
`With the complete darkness, the Demon Lord of the Darkest Black, Keiichi Maebara, was finally able to reach the surface world.`
`His magical power was without equal!!`
` In this darkness... nobody could stand against him!!`
` All must bow!!!`
`Ahh, will the heroines be unable to escape this darkness and be forced to submit to the will of the Demon Lord, forced to wear embarrassing outfit after embarrassing outfit,`
`being used as life-size dress-up dolls for all eternity!?!?`
`That's great, more, more!!`
`By the way, the school swimsuits are the classic type right!?`
`I won't forgive you if they're the competitive swimming style!!!`
`"...Dammit~!!`
` Shion!!`
` Thanks to you it ended up like this, so do something about it!!!"`
`"It's alright, Sis.`
` Kei-chan isn't the only one who can unleash their true power amid the darkness."`
`"...Huh?`
` Did we have such a convenient ally?"`
`"Ga ha ha ha ha!!`
` You're rather impertinent, Shion Sonozaki!!`
` Also, if you were expecting help from the Principal, that's too bad!! `
`'This is the ultimate desire of young men!`
` If you call yourself a man, do your best!' is written on this nice little authorization slip here!!!`
`Of course, you won't be able to rely on the newcomer Akasaka-san, either!`
`He's been on a private couple's hot springs vacation his wife's family set up for them since yesterday!!`
` In other words!`
` All the bases are covered!!"`
`"...You're so naive, Kei-chan.`
` ...Even characters who have art are able to reveal their true form in the darkness.`
` ...Chie-sensei!!!"`
`"...That's how it is, Maebara-kun."`
`"...It's dark so I can't really tell, but it seems like Chie-sensei's outfit is different.`
` ...What are those?`
` All those swords in her hands.`
` ...Th-They couldn't be!!`
` The Blac---hrmph!!!"`
`"......Any more than that is a secret.`
` Nipah~☆."`
`"...Maebara-kun?`
` ...That was just a little too much mischief on your part.`
` The church can't overlook any more than this."`
`"Wa-Wa-`
`Wait a minute,`
` this here,`
` there's no way, right,`
` that's cheating,`
` it's against the rules!!!!`
` Hey, she can't do this, right!?!?`
` Wa-wait, you can't use that big one!!!`
` Huuuh!? `
`Her arc drive has startup invincibility!?`
` The Seventh Hooo--`
` Gyagyagyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"`
`"Ahahaha...`
` Hello again.`
` Thank you very much for playing Higurashi When They Cry ~Himatsubushi~."`
`"I think you already know this, but Higurashi When They Cry is a type of visual novel without any choices. `
`Therefore, compared to adventure-type visual novels with branching routes to take, it's much closer to the experience of a book or a movie. `
`...Because of that, there is the opinion out there that this should not be called a game, per se.`
`If you're just watching it like a book or movie, Higurashi When They Cry isn't really a game, true. `
`...That's why, as you know, there are a lot of mysteries referenced during the course of the experience. `
`When you challenge those... this work will become a proper game.`
`All the players have the privilege of scrutinizing this mystery-packed story from all sorts of angles. `
`...For example, forming a theory about the mysteries during the course of the story, sharing them with your friends, and receiving their theories in return could be fun.`
`In any case... the next chapter starts the Answer Arcs.`
`We've tentatively called it 'Meakashi.'`
`...But, answers are a sad thing. Based on what is revealed, all the possibilities that you were allowed to imagine until now will suddenly become refined down to a few.`
`Based on that logic, we think that right here, before the answer arcs, is probably where people can enjoy this work we call Higurashi When They Cry the most.`
`If by chance, while you are reading this, you already have the Meakashi chapter at hand,`
` please enjoy hypothesizing, theorizing and fantasizing to the fullest before you start. `
`...That's where the real charm of the series takes place.`
`...Ahaha.`
` Sorry for saying something so impudent.`
` There's nothing better we'd like than for you to enjoy Higurashi When They Cry.`
`Well then, have a long and pleasant night!`
` We're waiting for you all in Hinamizawa!`
`If you come and play with Rena... I'd love to go treasure hunting together!`
` Hau☆!"`
