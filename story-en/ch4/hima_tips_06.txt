`The weather forecast had predicted that it wouldn't rain at all this entire week.`
`It's not that I hate sunny days or anything.`
`When every day is the same, unchanging, sunny weather, however, anybody would long for a rain cloud or two.`
`If it's simply clear skies for a week, a month, a year--anybody would long for a rain cloud or two.`
`The weather specialist said that they had carefully scrutinized a large quantity of past data, so it wouldn't be so likely for the forecast to be wrong.`
` I knew as much.`
`...But even then, there was occasionally a day where I was hoping that it would be wrong, as I stared up into the clear blue sky.`
`Was I being mischievous in hoping so?`
`I waited and waited, feeling almost suffocated by the boring blue sky undisturbed by a single cloud.`
`If you could die from that suffocating feeling...`
` then the population of Earth probably wouldn't have increased to this point.`
`In other words... the only person who was being suffocated by this was me.`
`And so...`
`I welcomed the summer evenings where not even the weather forecast could predict a sudden shower.`
`If I were to explain it like this, would you understand a bit more about how I feel?`
`Let's say that tonight's dinner was going to be curry rice.`
`But, when you're called down to the dinner table, what was waiting for you was instead an eggplant and bell pepper stirfry.`
`This is just on your mother's whim, by the way.`
`I would be delighted by such whimsy.`
` I don't really like eggplants or bell peppers, but still, I would be delighted.`
`The fact that that the pre-established routine of curry rice had been broken would be amusing.`
`If tonight was repeated a hundred times, and a hundred times you had to eat curry rice...`
`Yet for just this one night, that was changed to an eggplant and bell pepper stirfry,`
` there's no way you couldn't enjoy that chance happening.`
`I hate pre-established routines.`
`I really hate when things are all decided beforehand.`
`I have no love for boredom.`
`I always get my hopes up that something today will be different from yesterday, no matter how trivial.`
`It's been decided that this entire week starting today was going to be clear skies.`
`The weather forecast decided upon it, so the God of Weather must also feel obliged to do so.`
`But who's to say that a rain cloud might not just show up one day on a whim?`
`...It's something that nobody can say for sure, but because that thought remains in this world, a creature such as myself can continue living without being suffocated.`
`Tomorrow will probably be a hot and clear day.`
`However, I'm the only one that knows that predetermined fate, even with but a slim 1% chance... sometimes changes.`
`Hoping for that 1%, I hung up upside-down weather charms on my sunlit eavestroughs.`
`In the end, I spend my days waiting for those unexpected things in life to happen.`
`I pondered why I was hoping for it...`
`Why was I hoping for a rain cloud?`
`...The answer was simple.`
` I've had my fill of clear skies.`
`Then why was I hoping for a rain cloud?`
`...The answer was simple.`
` The fact that it was going to be sunny tomorrow was boring.`
`So why was I hoping for a rain cloud?`
`In the end, it doesn't really matter whether it rains or shines tomorrow.`
`Basically, it was just that the rain would water my heart, which was withered from boredom.`
`That's why rather than a TV drama where the plot's already been decided...`
`...I prefer to look up at the sky.`
