`If you were to call Hinamizawa a rather lonely village, then Takatsudo was outright desolate.`
`For your everyday city boy like me, I just couldn't understand why anybody would force themselves to live here.`
`There were signs that people had, but they were all covered in dust or enveloped in ivy, indicating that it was all abandoned.`
`"...People really lived in a place like this, didn't they."`
`"Well, it was a long time ago.`
` A remote place like this is pretty rough for old folk to live.`
` And the younger people probably wanted to try living in a more suitable place. `
`If there's nobody left to take the reins, all that gets left is this."`
`Even if I had no personal attachment to the village, seeing the disused buildings made me feel a little sentimental.`
`It seemed that Ooishi also felt the same way.`
`"...Was the wallet found over here?`
` The person who found it must have a good reason to come out to this desolate place."`
`"Yeah, there's some villagers who have a field out in the mountains here.`
` They pass by here in the morning and evenings."`
`"The villagers who work in the fields walk by here every day?"`
`"No way.`
` They probably go as far as they can by car."`
`"So in the early mornings and evenings, they pass by here, and just happened to find a single wallet?"`
`"...They probably did.`
` Na ha ha ha!"`
`"...Where exactly did they say they found it?"`
`"In a thicket just a bit further ahead.`
` The person who found the wallet just happened to have some stomach cramps, and was planning to use the thicket to do his business, it seems. `
`It was there he happened to find it.`
` Probably hoping there was some toilet paper in there.`
` Nfu fu fu fu!"`
`"...Everything about that story just seems a little too convenient.`
` Right from the discovery of the wallet, I just can't shake the feeling that something's off."`
`I expressed the feeling that I had from the start of the day quite frankly.`
`It seemed too good to be true, but it was unwavering proof.`
`But it was too perfect... sickeningly so.`
` That was my feeling.`
`"You might actually be on to something by saying it's all a little too perfect."`
`"...Meaning?"`
`"The truth is, I heard a little something from a friend of mine in the 4th Division.`
` Where Oryou Sonozaki referenced the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson."`
`"She referenced it?"`
`"'It's been several days since the Minister's grandson has been kidnapped. Poor boy.`
` It'd be nice if they let him go soon.'`
` It seems that Old Oryou muttered something like that while on her veranda. `
`And, that little musing was conveyed to the various people working deep behind the scenes at the Sonozaki family."`
`Right, I had heard something earlier from Sato-san, the informant.`
`That when the leader Oryou had a 'concern,' somebody in the family would be 'considerate.'`
`"So... in essence, she gave the order to release the hostage?"`
`"I see it that way.`
` The wallet being conveniently discovered was just a ploy to hand the boy over to the police."`
`"...Why would they release the hostage?"`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` Well, there's only one reason why somebody would release a hostage, isn't there?"`
`"What is it?"`
`"They reached a deal.`
` That would mean the Minister promised to halt the Hinamizawa Dam Project."`
`"...The dam project will definitely go away."`
`At that moment, those words that the girl had said resurfaced in the back of my mind.`
`...In the end, it was turning out exactly as she had proclaimed.`
`That young girl knew the circumstances.`
`She knew everything about this kidnapping incident, from the beginning to the end.`
`"...Akasaka."`
`The girl unexpectedly called my name.`
`"...What is it?"`
`"...Go back to Tokyo."`
`Huh...?`
`"...Before long, you will woefully regret coming to this village.`
`That would be an incredibly pathetic thing to see.`
` ...So I thought I'd warn you right now."`
`"...Why...would I come to regret it?"`
`"...Stop whining.`
`...When you tried crossing the road when the Don't Walk sign was up,`
` did your parents finish explaining why it was dangerous before pulling you back to the sidewalk?`
` They'd pull you back right away, wouldn't they? `
`They'd pull you back before explaining why it was dangerous, wouldn't they?`
` ...In other words, it's something like that."`
`...The girl, who knew everything from start to finish, had warned me in the beginning. Go back to Tokyo.`
`"...Akasaka is such a coward.`
` ...Tee hee hee hee hee...!"`
`"We'll probably find the boy... but what happens afterwards will probably be a bit of a problem.`
` How it'll be a problem though, is something a single officer like me can't figure out."`
`"Do you know...`
` a girl named Rika Furude?"`
`What I had said was such a non sequitur that Ooishi sat in stunned silence for a while.`
`"...Of course I know her.`
` She's the only daughter of the Furude family, one of the Three Families."`
`"What kind of girl is she?"`
`"...Well well.`
` This was an unexpected name to hear. I'm a bit surprised.`
` Does Public Safety think that the Furude family smells fishy and wants to keep an eye on them? `
`Share some of that information with me, please."`
`"Ah... no. It's not like that.`
` ...It's just... something that caught my attention."`
`"....Hmmm?`
` Na ha ha ha, well whatever.`
` It wouldn't do to not answer a question from a friend I've sat at the same table with."`
`"...I'm honored that you call me a friend."`
`"Nfu fu!`
` So, that little lady is, well, somewhat of a village mascot.`
` She's beloved by everybody in the village.`
` Some of the older folk worship her especially."`
`"Worship?"`
`"Hmmm, I don't know much about it, you see.`
` Girls born in the Furude family have somewhat of a sacred implication, it seems.`
` It's one of the local beliefs in Hinamizawa. `
`The living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama or something like it, or so the story goes, apparently."`
`"Oyashiro-sama...?`
` ...Now that you mention it, I think I saw 'Oyashiro-sama' written on some of the Alliance's banners.`
` ...What is Oyashiro-sama, exactly?"`
`"Ahh, it's the name of the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.`
` They believe it'll exact punishment on those who would do ill towards the village. `
`Well, if there was such a convenient god around, the guys at the dam would have long since been done in by divine justice.`
` Luckily, nothing like that has happened to anybody just yet."`
`"The grandson of the Minister who trifled with the village, as a result of Oyashiro-sama's anger, was... hmm... what did they call it again?`
` Oh, right. 'Onikakushi.'`
` The Minister's grandson was demoned away. `
`...That would probably be how the script is being written."`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` I see.`
` It probably would turn into something like that."`
`"Divine punishment wrought by Oyashiro-sama.`
` Then, the culprit is the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama...`
` ...that girl...?"`
`"Na ha ha ha ha ha!"`
`Even I didn't know exactly what I was saying, the fact that Ooishi laughed it off was a bit of a relief.`
`Ooishi's joyous laughter was so infectious that I began to laugh like an idiot as well.`
`"...Oh.`
` This is unusual."`
`Ooishi, after laying into the horn several times, rolled the window down and leaned out, waving his arm in an exaggerated manner.`
`It was a car headed the opposite way.`
`Until now, we hadn't run into any other cars except our own.`
`And of all places, it was at this desolate location.`
`It seemed that Ooishi knew the owner of that car.`
`The other car also chirped its horn, and came to a stop.`
`"Dr. Irie~~~!!!`
` Good afternoon."`
`The other car's window rolled down slowly, revealing a young man in a white overcoat.`
`He was about my age, or perhaps a bit older.`
` ...But you really can't judge somebody by their appearance.`
`"Why, if it isn't Ooishi-san.`
` Good afternoon.`
` ...Ha haha, fancy meeting you here."`
`"That's my line, doctor.`
` I never thought I'd see you here, nfu fu fu!`
` What happened?"`
`"Oh nothing, just a little house call."`
`"...Oh, really?`
` Was it an emergency?"`
`"No... nothing quite that serious.`
` Thankfully."`
`"It's always for the best when the patient gets better without the need of medical care.`
` Nfufufu...!"`
`"I'll take my leave here.`
` ...If I don't get back quickly, my staff will be angry with me."`
`"Nahaha!`
` Being the head of a clinic must be tough.`
` Well then, take care!"`
`The young doctor named Irie, after gesturing his farewell, drove forwards and soon disappeared around a corner.`
`Ooishi also drove forwards, but soon came to a stop again.`
`He pulled out a worn mapbook from the dash.`
`His expression didn't have an ounce of irreverence; he was perfectly serious.`
`"...What is it?"`
`"The clinic shouldn't be making any house calls today.`
` It must have been quite an emergency, or otherwise a patient with some extenuating circumstances."`
`Ooishi flipped through the pages, opening up to the map of Takatsudo. After that, he took a look around and started to figure out what our current location was.`
`"...Are you saying that emergency is suspicious?"`
`"Didn't I say?`
` There's hardly anybody that lives in the Takatsudo area.`
` ...The road we're on right now is here.`
` Dr. Irie came from this direction."`
`"..."`
`Having no sense of our surroundings, I couldn't digest anything about the place he was indicating on the map.`
`"We're heading towards the spot where the wallet was found.`
` By the way, that's over here.`
` But see?`
` If you're heading to one of the few residences in Takatsudo, it's the wrong road."`
`"...Meaning, Dr. Irie came from a direction where there are no residents?"`
`"As long as somebody working in the fields between these mountains didn't collapse.`
` But if somebody collapses and you call a doctor, normally you'd bring them back with you for a more detailed examination.`
`But just now, Dr. Irie said it was nothing serious.`
` And it didn't seem like anybody else was in the car with him."`
`Ooishi didn't say any more than that.`
`I also said nothing more.`
`That doctor just now, examined a patient.`
` Close by.`
` Only that.`
`The noisy radio had suddenly gone quiet.`
`The sky had just as suddenly turned an oppressive color.`
`...As Ooishi mused that it might start to rain, a torrential downpour started, as though trying not to disappoint him.`
`Eventually, Ooishi stopped the car.`
`The only sounds to break the silence were the percussion of the rain on the roof and the soft squeak of the windshield wipers.`
`"...Let's do this a bit hush-hush, shall we?"`
`Saying that in a quiet voice, he exited the car without an umbrella, careful not to make any noise.`
`Ooishi leaned over, indicating the other side of the thicket.`
`He was pointing to a prefabricated shed and a car that was parked beside it.`
`The car looked obviously well-cared-for--it wasn't a vehicle that had been left there for several years.`
`"...What's that shed?"`
`"It contains equipment used by the forestry service.`
` I heard that they don't go near it except during the summertime."`
`"Does that car belong to somebody from the forestry service, then?"`
`"Dunno.`
` It doesn't look like an official vehicle though."`
`Ooishi was playing it cool, but my nervousness was gradually increasing.`
`"Just in case."`
`Saying that, Ooishi returned to the car.`
`I thought he was going to get an umbrella, but he had grabbed the onboard radio instead.`
`"Hello, this is Ooishi.`
` Do you read?`
` Greetings, greetings, nfu fu."`
`"Yes, this is the Okinomiya PS.`
` Ooishi-san, we read you loud and clear, over."`
`"I'm currently in front of the forestry service's equipment shed.`
` Not the one in the direction of Yagouchi, the one in Takatsudo, if you head there from Hinamizawa."`
`"...Affirmative, copy that."`
`"There're some suspicious people in the shed.`
` Proceeding to investigate. `
`If you don't hear back from me in five minutes, get in touch with the local police substation and have them send a cruiser as soon as possible.`
` If you would, please."`
`"Understood."`
`"Well then... shall we go take a look?`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`Since he was first confined here, he had heard the sound of a car multiple times.`
`So he just thought the far-off sound was more of the same.`
`However, the reaction from his captors was, until now, something he hadn't seen before.`
`They jumped, reacting as if shocked by a jolt of electricity, and pressed against the window, cautiously peering outside.`
`"...They stopped."`
`"...Somebody from the forestry service?`
` This is bad."`
`"...Nah... looks like a cop ta me."`
`One of the captors lifted the boy by his collar and pressed a blade against his cheek.`
`"Hey kid, keep quiet for a bit.`
` I think you know this, but if you try and shout, there'll be problems..."`
`Toshiki Inukai was sure that the doctor had reported things to the police.`
`He had felt relief when he thought that he was saved. But not imagining that his captors would resort to violence when they were cornered, his anxiety remained unabated.`
`"What do we do?"`
`"...Gotta buy time.`
` Take tha kid, and slip outta tha back.`
` We'll meet back 'ere when tha heat's off."`
`One of the perpetrators grabbed the boy by the collar and forced him to stand.`
`Of course, Toshiki Inukai tried to resist by feigning that his illness had been aggravated by this rough treatment, but his captors paid no heed.`
`BANG BANG BANG!!!`
`The door was violently banged upon.`
`"Excuse me~~!!`
` Hello~~~!!!"`
`BANG BANG BANG, BANG!!`
`The door was banged on again.`
`Toshiki Inukai hesitated for a moment to respond to that voice by yelling.`
`However, while he was being indecisive, his mouth was covered, taking that option away from him.`
`The leader of the captors waved at the other to go.`
`The younger perpetrator nodded in response, and while keeping the boy's mouth covered, started heading towards the back door.`
`"Yello~~ d'ya need somethin'?"`
`"How do you do?`
` This is the police, would you mind opening the door?`
` Nfu fu fu!`
` This sudden rain has us in a bit of trouble."`
`"Uhhhh.`
` I'll jes' ope--"`
`The moment the lock was undone, Ooishi forced the door open.`
`And with a gleam of menace in his eyes, he pushed the man aside as he stepped into the room.`
`Then, in the small and empty room, he was able to quickly discern that the boy he was looking for was nowhere to be seen.`
`"Hmm?`
` I heard this was an equipment shed for the forestry service.`
` But there's nothing here at all."`
`There was nothing inside the room that would indicate this was an equipment shed.`
`There was only a mountain of blankets, indicating that somebody was sleeping here, alongside empty food packets strewn about.`
`"...Aah, 's been empty fer some time now.`
` Never seen no equipmen' stored 'round 'ere."`
`"But this is the forestry service's building, isn't it?`
` Are you from the forestry service?"`
`"...'Ow 'bout ya? Police?"`
`The two of them glared at each other suspiciously.`
`...Both Ooishi and the man steadfastly refused to reveal their identity before the other did.`
`The man, judging from the sharp look in Ooishi's eyes, realized that it would be hard to talk his way out of this one.`
`No matter what he said, the most time he could buy would probably be only a few dozen seconds.`
`Only the sound of rain filled this tense moment.`
`Just then, they heard the sound of a struggle from far off.`
`Ooishi had a hunch.`
`There was no doubt that Akasaka, who was circling around back, had run into the perpetrators who were trying to slip away!`
`As Ooishi thought that, the man in front of him reacted a moment faster.`
`The man swung with an attack that was more intended to obscure Ooishi's vision rather than actually hit him in the face.`
`Seizing his opportunity, the man aimed a kick at Ooishi's groin without any hesitation.`
`...But he missed his mark and was unable to land that critical blow.`
`The man, trying to pin Ooishi, grabbed him by the base of his neck with both hands and fiercely tried to push him down.`
`But, as Ooishi fell backwards, as if kicking the man upward, he dug his foot into the man's midsection.`
`With that leg acting as a fulcrum, the man was flung by the falling Ooishi as if by a circle throw.`
`The two of them squared off in the pouring rain.`
`"Isn't this interesting.`
` You wanna go!?`
` Naahahahahaha!!"`
`Ooishi, as if trying to cheer himself on, grinned smugly.`
`He then stood up while brushing the mud off himself.`
`Even though he countered the assault, Ooishi was getting up rather awkwardly compared to the man who he threw, who swiftly sprang to his feet.`
`"Ooishi-saaaaan!!`
` Hurry!!"`
`Akasaka's voice rang out from the distance.`
`Judging from the distress in his voice, he was already engaged in a fight, and wanted Ooishi to reconvene with him.`
`But Ooishi's hands were full as well.`
`"Akasaka-saaan!`
` Sorry, but can you wait a bit!?"`
`The man raised both fists into a stance that hinted at him being acquainted with karate or some other form of martial art.`
`Of course Ooishi, as an officer of the law, was decently versed in judo.`
`He also had the moxie to have been through his fair share of fights before.`
`Despite-- no, because of that, he could tell that the man in front of him was quite a bit better at fighting than he was.`
`...Ahh, dammit!`
` Thinking that this was going to be easy just because the order came from the Sonozaki family to release the hostage had been a big mistake!`
`"You're pretty good.`
` It's been a while since I got this worked up.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`Ooishi played off the situation like it was no sweat.`
`His opponent, seeing his attitude, took that to mean that Ooishi wasn't going to go down easily.`
`The man wildly charged forward, attempting to grab Ooishi!`
`If the man managed a successful clinch from his low stance, Ooishi would be tackled to the ground and end up being mounted.`
`It was something you saw often when children fought, but it really was a bad position, since you couldn't do much once you were in it.`
`Ooishi, responding to that move, also lowered his stance to collide with the man head on.`
`The moment they clashed, Ooishi grabbed the man's lapel!`
`As he yanked the lapel upwards, he smashed into the man's solar plexus with the elbow of the same arm.`
` It was a move from Ooishi's own personal brand of brawling judo.`
`He then grabbed on with his free hand and attempted to throw his opponent with both hands!`
`But the man lowered his center of gravity and swung his arms in a large arc, entwining them with Ooishi's.`
`Not only that, but he had forced both of Ooishi's elbows to the outside, and Ooishi, now in an awkward position, was in danger of exposing his back with his hands still clutching the man's chest!`
`This guy... practiced aikido or grappling, didn't he!?`
`Ooishi, cursing the fact that his fingers were twisted into the man's shirt and couldn't get away, released his grip.`
`But he was still in the awkward position of being bent over.`
` And to top it off, at zero range!`
`The man was able to read Ooishi's movements completely as he tried to squirm his way into a better position.`
`And then, took the palms of his hands...`
` and swiftly clapped them over both of Ooishi's ears.`
`"Arghhh!!!"`
`Clapping the ears in any other martial art, except for self-defense, was basically forbidden.`
`Karate and judo didn't recognize it as a legal technique.`
`It was that much of a simple--and dangerous--attack!`
`Ooishi raised both his hands as he tried to reflexively clutch at his own ears.`
`But before that could happen, the man wrapped his arms around Ooishi's neck.`
`His thick biceps clenched firmly around the base of Ooishi's neck like a vise.`
`Ooishi instinctively thought he was going to be killed.`
`After all, it wasn't hard to believe that a man like this, who was accustomed to fighting, could crush his opponent's neck from this position.`
`But his opponent didn't do that; he had chosen to keep his hold and force Ooishi to lose consciousness.`
`That's why Ooishi, at that moment, even though his face was twitching, was grinning widely.`
`Even though his opponent had a chance to kill him, he didn't choose to.`
`He was thinking:`
` "Ahh, this guy has no intention of killing me."`
`However, even though that might be the case, the man's hold on his neck was by no means gentle.`
`In no time at all, Ooishi's consciousness began to fade.`
`Having the experience of being taken down countless times in judo during his student days, Ooishi was utterly resigned to the fact that it was over.`
`Akasaka was finally recovering from the intense pain of being kicked in a rather sensitive area.`
`He had bumped into the captor carrying the boy by the back entrance.`
`He had seen Toshiki Inukai's picture plenty of times, but wasn't able to immediately ascertain if the boy in front of him was the real deal, with his mouth covered in packing tape.`
`Also, with his limited experience, it wasn't hard for him to panic over how to deal with the situation.`
`Of course, the perpetrator didn't overlook this momentary lapse.`
`His kick landed squarely in a critical spot, with Akasaka not even having time to call for help.`
`As the man flung the boy over his shoulder, he headed towards the front of the shed.`
`But upon hearing Ooishi's bellowing voice, he gave up on going that direction.`
`He then dashed off towards the forest.`
`As if the weight of the boy slung over his shoulder wasn't even there.`
`Akasaka was lost for a moment.`
`Meeting up with Ooishi, who was fighting with the enemy, was by far the safer option.`
`But, he couldn't just lose sight of the fleeing man!`
`Akasaka stood up and chased after the captor's back.`
`He ran through a short thicket, branches and fallen leaves crunching underfoot.`
`The tips of branches raked and clawed at him, small scratches inscribing themselves on his body one after another.`
`He kept on stepping into puddles and mud, and his shoes were soon filled with murky water.`
`For Akasaka, travelling through this unexplored forest was, even though this was an emergency situation, extremely unpleasant.`
`"Stooooop!!`
` This is the police!!"`
`As he said that, he regretted it immediately, as it was but a waste of breath.`
`There wasn't a thief in the world that would politely stop when told to by the police.`
`To a city boy like Akasaka, running through this forest was an arduous task...`
` however, it must have been no easy task either for the man carrying the minister's grandson.`
`He neither gained nor lost ground in his pursuit.`
`Akasaka, upon realizing that, gained back a bit of composure.`
`Just keep on chasing him.`
`We are running in the same conditions.`
` In fact, the man running with an awkward stride was at far more of a disadvantage.`
`They couldn't run forever.`
` Eventually, he'd definitely trip and fall!`
`As long as he was being hounded, he would definitely stumble!!`
`And soon, his wish was fulfilled.`
`"...Whoa!!"`
`The man, who had stepped in something and lost his balance, was no longer able to bear the weight of the boy, dropping him.`
`Akasaka, in all honesty, didn't care about the perpetrator at all.`
`Just as long as he could ensure the safety of Toshiki Inukai.`
`So if the perpetrator ran off by himself, it was perfectly acceptable.`
`...But it seemed that Toshiki Inukai was important to the man as well, and didn't choose to just run away empty-handed.`
`Akasaka didn't know what to do in this kind of situation.`
`His first priority should probably be to ensure the safety of the boy, subduing his captor being less important.`
`Grappling with the perpetrator wasn't something he planned on.`
`But most likely, it was either do or die.`
`Akasaka's moment of indecision proved to be fatal.`
`The man, aiming right between, or rather, for both of Akasaka's eyes, struck out with a jab.`
`Not wanting that, Akasaka raised both his hands to shield his face. At that moment, the man kicked at his unguarded midsection.`
`The pain almost felt like his vital organs were being squeezed out of his body, but he latched onto his opponent's leg.`
`But his opponent didn't hesitate one bit.`
`Leading with his seized foot, the man jumped at Akasaka, applying pressure and pushing him down.`
`Akasaka was unable to withstand that and fell, but under no circumstances was he letting that leg go.`
`The two men fell together in a tangled heap.`
`The man was desperate to pull his leg free from Akasaka, but having fallen in an awkward position, was unable to.`
`The two of them rolled around on the ground, floundering about trying to gain an advantage.`
`But Akasaka, who was holding onto his opponent's knee with both hands, and that opponent, who had complete freedom to move his upper body, were in two completely different situations.`
`The man gained a positional advantage on Akasaka, who was still latched onto his leg and couldn't move away, and pounded full force on his head with both his fists.`
`Not only that, he found a rock nearby and beat it against Akasaka's skull!`
`THWACK!`
` THWACK!`
` THWACK!!!`
`The difference between being hit with a fist and being hit with a rock was vast!!`
`Akasaka quickly thought of letting go of the man's leg to free his hands to protect his head.`
`But... if he let go here, the man would get away!`
`If he didn't dig in here, everything would be for naught.`
`The boy he was trying to save was right there.`
`He was going to save him and go back to Tokyo!!`
`If he could do that, then it was goodbye to this freakish village!`
`BAM!!`
` CRACK!!`
` THUD!!!`
`Without looking, I could tell my forehead had split open and was gushing blood.`
`But, I didn't let go of the man's leg.`
` How could I? I won't let go!`
`When the man realized that no matter how much he beat my head he wasn't getting away, he used both his hands to grab my throat as if to crush my windpipe.`
`I pulled my head back as a slight form of resistance, but it was of no use.`
`The man's hands enveloped my neck, and began to crush it like a vise!`
`It was less about the pain of not being able to breathe, so much as it was choking so hard I felt like I was going to throw up.`
`It felt like my stomach was going to turn itself inside-out!!`
` But I could only endure it!`
`...Dammitdammitdammit!!!`
`My throat...h-h-hurts!!`
`I won't let go, I can't let go!!`
`I didn't want to be here.`
`I wanted to resolve this, and go back to Tokyo!`
` Go back to Tokyo,`
` and talk to Yukie,`
` all about our unborn child...`
` We were going to talk about our bright future!!`
`I had no intention of loosening my grip.`
` ...However, it loosened just a bit, and the man's leg came free.`
`The man kicked as hard as possible, and I tumbled backwards.`
`My head was spinning, and I was unable to get up right away.`
` ...No, I couldn't even put any strength into getting up in the first place.`
`Even so, I couldn't back down!!!`
`If I let him escape now, this chance would never come again!!`
`Even just catching their scent was nothing short of a miracle.`
`If we weren't able to get the Minister's grandson back here, there wouldn't be another chance.`
`The man tried to drag the boy to his feet, but the kid was displaying some unexpected resistance, allowing me to get up unnoticed.`
`I grasped the rock the man had just beat me over the head with.`
` ...Now it's my turn!!`
`"Yaaaaarrrrrrggghh!!!"`
`The rock should be able to supplement what meager strength I had left... adding more than enough power to my attack!!`
`My fist, still wrapped around the rock, dug into the side of the man's torso.`
` It seems like it hurt him quite a bit.`
`"...Ugh...`
` Gah!!!"`
`The man rolled around for a bit, clutching his side.`
`Freed from the man's grip, the boy hid behind me.`
`"Toshiki Inukai-kun, right!?`
` I've come to help you!!"`
`To the boy, those were the words he was waiting for the most!`
`But, the crisis was still not over.`
`That was because even though he was still clutching at his side, the man had gotten up again, and had taken a fighting stance.`
`I could see in the man's eyes the resentment at the pain I had caused him, and the confidence that he could still beat me.`
`If we were to clash head-on again, he might not even stop if my head were split open.`
`"Stop resisting!!`
` Surrender quietly!!"`
`"You should just hand the boy over!!`
` Do you want me to snap your neck!?"`
`"Who would listen to you now!?`
` Reinforcements are already on their way!`
` There's nowhere for you to run!!"`
`The man reacted adversely to the word "reinforcements."`
`That was because he now knew that arguing like this wasn't just waste of time, but put him closer and closer to danger.`
`Realizing that, the man shifted mental gears almost too quickly.`
`"Then let's finish this fast!!`
` How about this...!!"`
`"...Wha!?"`
`What the man pulled from his back pocket was of all things, a gun!`
`Of course, I'm a police officer.`
`It's not like I don't know what a gun is.`
`But having one pointed at me was something I'd never experienced before.`
`Was it... real?`
`Of course it was!!`
` There's no way it'd be a replica in a situation like this!!`
`"Put both your hands behind your head and lay down quietly!!"`
`"Don't get cocky, you villain!!`
` I won't do anything you say!!"`
`"You stupid idiot!!`
` Do you not know what this is without me shooting you with it!?"`
`"Then shoot!`
` Reinforcements will hear the gunshot and head right over here!!"`
`"Are you stupid!?`
` We're in the middle of the forest, and on top of that, it's raining!!`
` They'll never hear a thing!!"`
`As long as he still held that gun, no matter how much I yelled at him, I was at a distinct disadvantage.`
`But, I still had a fighting chance.`
`If I were in his shoes, instead of wasting time yelling at each other like this, I would just shoot him and take the boy.`
`That way was the fastest, and would suppress any sort of further resistance from him.`
`But the man was demanding my surrender, without having fired a shot.`
`Meaning that he either didn't want to shoot, or couldn't.`
` ...In other words, the man in front of me was soft!`
`If I could buy even just a little more time, the factors that would lead to my victory were numerous.`
`Ooishi was probably on his way, and the reinforcements we called for before coming here should already be well on their way too.`
`Not only that, they should have contacted the local police box.`
`Without a doubt, somebody stationed in the village would be here much quicker than that!`
`"...Dammit...!!`
` Do I have to put a bullet in you to understand how dangerous this thing is!?"`
`"There's no escape!!`
` Don't add to your crimes!!"`
`At that moment, I heard the rustling of foliage and heavy footsteps approaching.`
`If Ooishi was coming here, it was a whole new ball game.`
`The man couldn't have more than one gun!`
`"Ooishi-san!!`
` Over here!! Over here!!!`
` ...Huh!?"`
`I had thought that time was on my side.`
`But I had failed to even imagine that the enemy could also have reinforcements!!`
`You could tell the man who had just appeared was one of the perpetrators just by looking at him.`
`"Whaddya doin'...`
` If ya don' hurry up, the police'll get 'ere!`
` Stop lollygaggin'!!"`
`"...Dammit...!!`
` What happened to Ooishi-san!?"`
`"Aah, tha' chubby fella?`
` E's down fer tha count.`
` Eee hee hee!"`
`"He is!?`
` ....Dammit...!!"`
`The boy, sensitive to the impending danger, curled up behind my back.`
`...How could this be...dammit!!`
`"Your buddy isn't coming!!`
` Serves you right!!`
` Shoe's on the other foot now!!"`
`As I backed up against a large tree while still protecting the boy, the second man also pulled out a gun.`
`"Won' be sayin' this twice.`
` Put yer 'ands on yer 'ead and lie down."`
`"I refuse!!!"`
`BANG!`
`As I shouted in protest, blood erupted from my left shoulder. It took a few moments to register that I had been shot!`
`Compared to the ones from in movies and TV dramas, the first actual gunshot I heard was simple and mundane.`
`In fact, the sound was more akin to the small fireworks I used to buy from the corner store as a kid.`
`But there was no comparing the pain...`
` It was a fear you knew only after you've been shot.`
`"..Ah... gh... nghh...!!!"`
`"...S-Sir!?`
` Are you okay!?`
` Are you okay!!?"`
`The boy, in his confusion, tugged at my clothes, agitating the wound even further.`
`I wanted to put on a bold face and reassure him, but my voice was hoarse and had the opposite effect.`
`"I-I'm all right!!`
` I've already called for backup.`
` There'll be a full squad here soon!`
` ...Gah...!"`
`"It'll be quicker ta put one thru yer 'ead afore the cops get 'ere.`
` But tha family said no needless killin', so I'm taking it easy on ya.`
` Don' mess with me, or I ain't 'oldin' back."`
`...This was bad.`
` ...It was very very bad.`
`This second man was a completely different beast than the first!`
` He had no signs of indecisiveness or mercy!!`
`If this man said he'd shoot, he'd shoot!`
`He wasn't somebody that a man like me could buy time from!!`
`I really hated to admit it, but at that moment, the image of Yukie's smiling face crossed the back of my mind.`
`I knew what that meant.`
`I was warning myself to not throw my life away over a matter of pride.`
`Of course I didn't want to die here!`
`I was just starting a new life with Yukie, and I wanted to see the face of our soon-to-be-born child!!`
`Why should I risk my life for some Minister's grandson when I was at such a critical juncture in my own life!!!`
`...Arrghh! Dammit! Dammit!!`
`I need to stop rambling at myself!`
` So what do I do now!?`
` Give up the boy and extend my own life!?`
` What a good idea!!`
` Everybody's life is precious!!`
` My own life was in danger!!`
` Nobody would blame me!!!`
`Arghh, goddammit... it hurts... it hurts...!!!`
`If I had known it would be this painful, I wouldn't have played the tough guy!!`
`My biggest miscalculation though, was that the sound of the gunshot was far quieter than I had imagined.`
`If it was only that loud, it would be drowned out by the rain in the forest!`
`It wasn't something that somebody far away could hear!!`
