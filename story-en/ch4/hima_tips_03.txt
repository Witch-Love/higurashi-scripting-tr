`The world is filled with people blessed with relationships.`
`Of course, that doesn't mean that everyone is connected to each other.`
`It's obvious that on the other side of the planet, there are people laughing and crying who can't possibly have an effect on you.`
`However, in the extremely limited community of the neighborhood, that sort of connection is just a matter of fact.`
`It's quite possible that a single remarkable event could have massive consequences inside a small community.`
`If you were to increase that in scale... a perfect stranger on the other side of the globe might become enough of a legend to have an effect on our lives.`
`Well, it's not always that way.`
`Like I said at the beginning, the links between people basically aren't that relevant in the grand scheme of things.`
`Whether some household nearby is having steak or croquettes doesn't matter to me.`
`When I put on my shoes, it doesn't matter to anybody whether I put the right one on first or the left.`
`...This much the average person can understand.`
`But actually, in reality, this is the truth.`
` The bonds between people are quite well defined.`
`It's not just a matter of distance, of being far or near.`
`For example, let's say that Person A's actions have some effect on me.`
`Even then, Person B's actions could have absolutely no consequence on my life.`
`The reverse also holds true. Just because my actions affect Person A, that doesn't always mean that they affect Person B as well.`
`Let's put it bluntly.`
`If the bonds between people are like gears in a machine...`
`The gear that represents me meshes with some people, but is isolated from others.`
`There are some who would try arguing against this.`
`Those people would bring up the example of gears in a clock.`
`Each gear indeed only directly meshes with one or two others...`
`However, if you rotate one gear, the one next to it is moved, which connects to the next one, and the next... in the end, all the gears are moving.`
`...There is a logic behind this, more than enough to convince the average person.`
`Why is the argument convincing?`
`...The answer is simple.`
`The relationships between people are ambiguous, and can only be described conceptually.`
`How the gears are connected and how their movements are chained together can't be used as a fundamental explanation, so it throws a wet blanket on that argument.`
`So for the people who like that explanation, I'll use the example of a clock again to refute it.`
`First of all, to say that this world is a singular clock would be wrong.`
`That is, there isn't only one clock.`
`There exist many clocks in this world, each counting their own time.`
`If you think about it, the idea that this world is just one big clock is the height of arrogance.`
`Even if you use the analogy of gears to explain human relationships,`
` then you should be able to explain it using an analogy of multiple clocks unrelated to a single gear.`
`Neighbors A and B.`
`A is a gear in the same clock as me, so it's best to remain civil.`
`B is a gear in a different clock, so he doesn't really matter to me at all.`
`That's the kind of clear distinction I'm talking about.`
`You want to say I'm being fallacious?`
`Then let's change the analogy to something more familiar, so you can understand.`
`You've probably heard the phrase "a fire on the opposite shore" sometime in your life, no?`
`For example, if your neighbor's house was on fire, you'd probably try and help to put it out, wouldn't you?`
` It'd be awful if the fire spread and burned down your own house, after all.`
`But what if that fire was in a town on the opposite side of a river?`
`Would you still go out of your way to help?`
` You wouldn't, would you?`
` Even though it would be the wrong thing to do, there's no way the fire could spread to your own house.`
`Even if it turned into a huge conflagration, there's no relation between the houses that will spread fire to yours and those that won't.`
`With this basic example, you should be able to see the difference between gears that are or aren't related to your own.`
`...Having said that, there's still a lot to think about, even without a river to divide it.`
`After all, it's not a spatial problem like being on the other side of the river, is it?`
