`One sunny Parent-Teacher Day.`
`There was a cooking class, and my child was making curry rice with a practiced hand.`
`While the other children her age were awkwardly using their kitchen knives, that child was wielding hers deftly.`
`The teacher approached me with a smile on their face, saying it must be a result of learning it at home.`
`I managed to play it off with a vague smile and a nod in response.`
`...That was because I had never once taught my child how to make curry rice.`
`Even then, she was peeling vegetables with a practiced hand, adding them into the pot in the order of which took longer to cook.`
`For a normal parent, they might unintentionally clap their hands together, happy at their child's actions.`
`But in my case, it was different.`
`...There was no mistaking that somebody had taught her how to make that curry rice when I wasn't taking care of her.`
`...Thinking that, I quietly fell into an unpleasant mood.`
`When I asked, it seemed she could also sew and do the laundry.`
`I had never taught her how to do those, and again, never saw her do it around the house.`
`Be it cooking or sewing or the laundry.`
`...Again, that was probably because the elderly villagers taught her all sorts of rubbish when I wasn't looking.`
`And not only that, they probably taught her all sorts of strange superstitions, trying to prop her up as the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`I said as much to my husband, suggesting that we should keep our child away from the elderly folk.`
`But my husband, who was in the position of being the head priest of the Furude Shrine, had little power against the elderly who supported it.`
`...He took the rather uncommitted stance of saying that as long as she was being doted upon, wasn't it fine?`
`I argued against that.`
`That she was our child, and should be a completely normal girl.`
`That what the elderly were expecting, that she was the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama, was simply odd.`
`The elderly villagers believe that child has divine powers.`
`We would discuss the weather for the following day, but there were many times when I left the house without an umbrella and came back soaking wet.`
`Rather than having clairvoyance, that was just second-hand knowledge from her watching the news all the time.`
`The things that she knew that she shouldn't have known were just a result of the people who were trying to indoctrinate her and the people who were gossiping getting together in the village.`
`However... there certainly were days when everybody thought it was going to be sunny all day, and that child would stubbornly not go out without an umbrella.`
`It would occasionally rain, and in the end, we would be saved.`
`...There might also have been times where Rika knew of major accidents in foreign countries faster than the news did.`
`I thought that she must have heard it break over the radio or something.`
`...Knowing things she shouldn't have,`
` something like that...`
` Was in front of me right now, wasn't it?`
`That child was making curry rice when there shouldn't have been anybody who taught her how to.`
`No, no... that couldn't possibly be the case.`
`Somebody had taught her, indoctrinated her.`
`When I wasn't taking care of her, somebody had indoctrinated Rika with something.`
`"Furude-san's curry is absolutely splendid.`
` I'll give it a gold star!"`
`"......Nipah~â˜†."`
`"Where did you learn to cook, Furude-san?`
` At home?"`
`"......Yes.`
` At home."`
`The other parents in attendance were impressed.`
`Lies, all lies.`
` ...I didn't teach her anything.`
`Who was it? Who was it?`
` Who was the person who had completely indoctrinated my child?`
`She was my normal, average daughter, not the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama!`
