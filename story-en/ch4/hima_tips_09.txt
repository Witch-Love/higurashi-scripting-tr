`Do you believe that there are choices in life?`
`There are many people who lament the following:`
`If there only existed points in life where there were clear choices to make, we would be able to scrutinize those carefully and make decisions that would lead us to a better future.`
`Every time I hear people lament as such, I cast it off as a rather trivial worry.`
`Even if you were given a clear choice, it wouldn't be meaningful at all, and there wouldn't be any such path to a better future.`
`...Is this hard to understand?`
`Then let's pretend that in front of you there are two strange boxes.`
`In other words, you have two clear choices.`
`Do you open the red box, or the blue box?`
`A lot of things would be uncertain even with that choice, wouldn't they?`
`If you don't have the option of opening neither, then your choice boils down to the natural impulse of opening the box that holds the better result for you.`
`Then, after examining the shape and features of each, and pondering a great many things, you have to pick either the red or the blue.`
`...If this was you, which box would you open?`
`Red or blue?`
`...If you were to go by their traditional meanings, then red would be a dangerous, threatening color.`
`However, that doesn't automatically mean that it would be calm and relaxing inside the blue box, either.`
`In fact, it might even be that the colors are a trap, make you wary of the red box and have you open the blue.`
`A trap?`
`...Could it be the contents of the box aren't a reward, but rather a penalty?`
`See...? Now you're at a loss.`
`You're so conflicted over the choice between red and blue that you've started wishing there was an option to open neither and just leave.`
`But there isn't.`
` You have to open either the red box or the blue box.`
`Oh, I forgot to say this, but if you choose one box, the other will disappear.`
`So you'll never know the contents of the box you don't open.`
` I'll just put that rule at the end there for you.`
`Now.`
` Why don't you choose?`
`The red box, or the blue box?`
`...It's all right, you won't lose anything by picking either one.`
` ...Come on now.`
`Have you thought about it?`
`In the end, you chose this color, didn't you?`
`...As soon as you chose, the other box disappeared.`
`So you can give up on the contents of that one, okay?`
`That's the rule.`
`Now, open up the box you chose.`
`Inside the box there was...`
` a piece of caramel.`
`Have you thought about it?`
`In the end, you chose this color, didn't you?`
`...As soon as you chose, the other box disappeared.`
`So you can give up on the contents of that one, okay?`
`That's the rule.`
`Now, open up the box you chose.`
`Inside the box there was...`
` a stick of chewing gum.`
`...I know you're a little disappointed.`
`Well that's only natural.`
`No matter how you look at it, it looks like you drew the dud.`
`The correct box might have had a bar of chocolate in it, for all you know.`
`No, in fact, something incredible like a pair of tickets to Hawaii might have been in there.`
`But even if you wanted to verify that, the other box has already disappeared.`
`There's no way you can check now.`
`But if you think about it from an optimistic point of view...`
`Just maybe... the other box was empty, and this box was the winner.`
`And being satisfied (or perhaps not) with such a cheap prize, you pop it into your mouth and start chewing it happily.`
`So, what do you think in the end?`
`If you were given a second chance, would you try to open the other box?`
`...But unfortunately, the chance to choose between the red box or the blue box has come and gone, never to be seen again.`
`The chance to change your selection will never come.`
`Don't your parents often say: Every choice you make in life only happens once, so choose carefully?`
`Hee hee hee...`
`See?`
` Choices aren't that great after all.`
` ...Aren't you a little disillusioned now?`
` Ahhahahahahaha...`
`...Right now you're thinking: "That's it?"`
`That's right, the contents of the red box and the blue box were a piece of caramel and a stick of chewing gum.`
`You might have thought you made the wrong choice before, but now seeing them together like this, you can't really say that either choice was the wrong one.`
`Well, I guess everybody has their personal preferences.`
`If you prefer caramel to gum, for example.`
`...You're definitely thinking of choosing to open the box again based on that preference.`
`...The clear choices you wanted were basically this.`
`The selfish desire to open up both boxes and compare the contents, then pick the one most suited to you.`
`But you see,`
` reality is the same as this game.`
`If you pick one, the one you didn't choose disappears.`
` So there's no way you could check the result.`
`If at that time,`
` if you had done this,`
` or perhaps if you had done that...`
` then it wouldn't be hard to imagine that you could be happier (or perhaps less happy) than you are right now.`
`In the end, you only have the pleasure of approving of or being disappointed by the choice that you did make.`
`But that's fine.`
`After all, didn't you enjoy the thrill of making the choice?`
`If, like now, you knew the contents of both boxes,`
` then the choice between the red box or the blue box would just be a waste of time.`
`Because instead of this boring game about boxes, you could be looking at the quickly-changing evening summer sky, listening for the distant sound of thunder, and pondering if it's going to rain or not... that would be much more fun.`
