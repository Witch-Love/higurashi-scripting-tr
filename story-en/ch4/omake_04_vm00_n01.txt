`"Nobody move!!`
` Any weird movements, and you'll come face-to-face with a combo trap that takes you from a pendulum to a landmine to an electric chair with a buzzsaw!!"`
`"I thought it was you, Shion!!`
` Even though you're penciled in to be the main character in the next scenario! This is an outrage!`
` Now you've gone and done it!!"`
`"Yup.`
` In the first half of the Watanagashi chapter, there were a lot of people getting infatuated with Mii-chan."`
`"...What're you trying to do?`
` ...The lightswitches?`
` I see, you're planning to do something when the room's pitch black, aren't you?`
` Hee hee hee... resistance is futile."`
`"...You can't do anything just by turning off the lights...`
` ...Rena, I'm sorry, but do what they say..."`
`"It's alright, don't worry.`
` By turning off the lights... we can reverse this situation!"`
`"Th-That voice is... Kei-chan!?!?"`
`"Rena, you have my thanks!!`
` When even the moon abandons the land and shrouds it in true darkness,`
`"I see.`
` So?`
` How is Kei-chan going to appear here, when he doesn't even have any character art?`
` ...It couldn't possibly be that they'd insert new character art just for this.`
` Heh heh heh!!"`
`"...Gah!!`
` No!!`
` If the lights are turned off...!!`
` Chie-sensei, hold Rena-chan back!!"`
`"...Save meeeeeeee!! Keiichi-kuuuuuuuuun!!!!!"`
`"I see, if it's like this, he can appear even if he doesn't have any character art."`
`"...There's no character or background art, so it's really easy on the production staff."`
`"This isn't some sort of transformation. I'll have you know I've always been a Demon Lord!!`
` And as of right now, this world which is enveloped within true darkness shall dance upon the palm of my hand!! `
`Within this world of darkness, there are none who can oppose me!!!!"`
`"Maebara-sama, you're the best~~!!!!!`
` How about a bunny girl, or campaign girl costu-- no no, lingerie could be good too!! `
`No, wait!!`
` How about just about making everybody naked!!!`
`B-But of course, leave the socks on!!!"`
`"...You're so naive, Kei-chan.`
` ...Even characters who have art are able to reveal their true form in the darkness.`
` The Blac---hrmph!!!"`
`"Oh.`
` Then you're saying you want to withdraw from being the lead in`
` 'Live Performance!! Satoko's Maid Training, Dress-up Chapter'`
` that we planned on filming after this?"`
` Every. Afterparty. `
`Without any character art, without any sort of appreciation. Witness my`
` anger,`
` my grudge,`
` and all of my sorrow!!`
`I shall instill it all upon you!!!"`
`"Wa-Wa-`
`Wait a minute,`
` this here,`
` there's no way, right,`
` that's cheating,`
` it's against the rules!!!!`
` Hey, she can't do this, right!?!?`
` Wa-wait, you can't use that big one!!!`
` Huuuh!? `
`Her arc drive has startup invincibility!?`
` The Seventh Hooo--`
` Gyagyagyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"`
