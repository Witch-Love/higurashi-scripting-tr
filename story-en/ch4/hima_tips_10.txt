`"...Uh-huh, yes.`
` ...So the wake will be from six PM tomorrow, and the service will be the day after from noon until one.`
` The venue will be Okinomiya Ceremony Hall..."`
`"...I see.`
` It's Deputy Mayor Ikezawa's grandson's funeral we're talking about. We have to pay our respects.`
` Mion, I'll have you go in my stead."`
`"Okay, got it.`
` Should I wear mourning clothes?`
` How much should I bring for the funeral offering?"`
`"You can go in your school uniform.`
` Make sure you button it up properly.`
` For the money, fifty--`
` No... a hundred thousand yen.`
` They've done a lot for us."`
`Mion quietly whistled in awe at the exorbitant amount of money her grandmother was offering.`
`"Ikezawa-san's been a prudent person ever since his days as head of the Okinomiya Municipal Office.`
` ...Even if those government-types paid me a visit, they'd always stay outside. `
`But whenever I offered Ikezawa-san a cup of tea, he'd come inside and carefully listen to what I had to say.`
` ...He always lent a proper ear to what people had to say. Others should learn from a person like him."`
`The two guests made a show of nodding, making it clear they were paying attention as Oryou reminisced.`
`The sight of them trying not to get on Oryou's bad side was humorous enough to elicit laughter from Mion occasionally.`
`"How young was Deputy Mayor Ikezawa's grandson when he died?"`
`"...Umm...`
` 11 years old, apparently..."`
`Oryou closed her eyes and shook her head lightly, lamenting the loss of such a young life.`
`"If I recall correctly, he said he only had one grandchild....`
` ...how sad...`
` there's nothing worse for a parent than outliving their offspring."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` You're really nice to other people, Granny.`
` If Shion or I died, would you be this sad?"`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` Saying something like that is bad luck!"`
`Having got the reaction she expected, Mion cackled.`
`The two guests, unsure if they were supposed to laugh along, instead forced awkward smiles.`
`"We'll take our leave for today, then...`
` We'll be by tomorrow evening at five to pick you up.`
` Until then...`
` please excuse us..."`
`After bowing their heads repeatedly, the guests left by the front door.`
`Mion saw them off, waving her little hand goodbye.`
`"...They're gone.`
` ...It must be rough for them to pay you a courtesy visit, Granny.`
` It would have been fine if they just broke the news over the phone.`
` Heh heh heh..."`
`Well, it was true that Oryou Sonozaki was a central person for both her relatives and the residents of Hinamizawa Village as a whole.`
`As a voting bloc, they numbered in the several thousands.`
`It wasn't hard to imagine the mayor would try to pander to her.`
`Unlike Mion, however, Oryou was looking up longingly at the sky from the veranda.`
`"What's the matter?`
` Are you going senile?`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"...I just thought that no matter whose grandchild it was... I'd feel sorry for them..."`
`Saying that, she let out a deep sigh.`
`Mion was let down, as normally her grandmother would have scolded her for her attitude.`
`"Mion.`
` ...You know... that Minister's grandson.`
` How long has it been since he was abducted?"`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Four days, maybe?"`
`Oryou let out another deep sigh.`
`"He may be the grandchild of our bitter enemy... but I still feel sorry for him."`
`"....Really?"`
`"That's enough of a warning.`
` ...We should bring this to an end soon."`
`"..."`
`The playful expression drained from Mion's face, leaving behind a stern one.`
`And then, as if to ascertain Oryou's will, looked into her eyes.`
`...Oryou, expressing her intention with only those eyes, looked back into Mion's.`
`"...I want some tea, could you call for some?`
` Some of that chocolate too."`
`Mion gave a small nod, then turned around.`
`"Shimiko-san, are you there?`
` Grandma wants some tea, could you prepare some?"`
`From far away, a voice responded in the affirmative.`
`Mion, after confirming she'd been heard, picked up the phone and began dialing.`
`"....Ah, hello?`
` This is Mion.`
` ...Yeah.`
` ...Is my father there?"`
