`...And so, when we made it to the shrine...`
`...`
`...`
` Ahh, cliches are wonderful.`
`The typical scene of carnage everyone was expecting had come to fruition.`
`"Oh, my, I should have expected no less, Jirou-san.`
` You sure are popular with children.`
` Since when were you such a celebrity, hmm?"`
`"Y-Y-Y-Y-You've got it all wrong!`
` This has to be some kind of mistake...!`
` Oof!`
` Rena-chan, don't cling to me like that...!"`
`"Heeeeey, Tomitake-san☆`
` Can you teach Rena about all the things you can do with cameras? Can you teach her?"`
`"Well, I mean, ah hahaha, the way of the camera is long and treacherous, but it's definitely worth traveling!`
` I'm happy you're showing an interest in it, Rena-chan...`
` Haha, hahahahaha, haha..."`
`"Oh, well, don't mind me, then.`
` After all, Jirou-san is a very, very kind-hearted veteran cameraman.`
` He'd be nice and teach just about any interested girl, not only me—isn't that right?"`
`"That kind, gentle part of you, Tomitake-san...`
` Rena loooves it...`
` I wonder if you could teach me...`
` about cameras...`
` and about many other things too...`
` Many other things."`
`"Wh-What other things?!`
` Haha, hahahahahaha..."`
`"Jirou-san, you haven't even found out what those other things are yet, but you'll still teach her?`
` You're so good at this.`
` At times like those, Jirou-san...`
` can be very forceful."`
`"Wh-Wh-What is he forceful about, I wonder... I wonder!`
`...But... Rena, well... if it's Tomitake-san...`
` She'll let him teach her...`
` just about anything...`
` Just about anything."`
`"No, ahhhh, ohhh, ohh hohahahahahahaha...!"`
`...Tomitake's gross-sounding laugh echoed through the shrine grounds.`
`Maybe an average boy of this nation who had never experienced a girl's advances would have this kind of reaction. `
`...This was funny, so next time we should experiment on Keiichi, and test it on Akasaka during his next family trip.`
`Maybe it would be rude to the two of them, but this was an incredibly amusing struggle when seen from afar.`
`"R-Renaaa!!`
` Open your eyes!!`
` Your feelings for him aren't real!!"`
`"A-A-Aren't real?! How rude!`
` These are Rena's true feelings!`
`Rena realized something... Tomitake-san is really very kind!`
` It might not mean much at all, but now that I've realized it, I can't ever forget it...!! `
`I'm sure Rena is the only one who could ever appreciate his kindness!!`
` So Tomitake-san is the only one for Rena now!"`
`"...Ha... Haaaaaaahhhhh..."`
`His brain must have been producing every single chemical that could make him feel pleasant. `
`Tomitake made a face like he was in heaven on earth, and he stood there in a daze, a trickle of drool hanging from his mouth. `
`...Takano's expression made for a marked contrast with his—and that contrast was truly delightful.`
`"Tomitake-san!!`
` You can't forget about Takano-san!`
` Are you going to abandon your own partner?!"`
`"Th-That's right...!`
` I-I'm sorry, Rena-chan, but I already have Takano-san!!`
` S-S-So, well, I...!"`
`"Hmm...?`
` I wonder what you mean by 'partner'?`
` You'll have to be more specific.`
` You have to say exactly what you mean, or I won't understand."`
`"Er, well, I...`
` umm, err...`
` ahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Rena can tell you!`
` Takano-san is your friend, Tomitake-san!"`
`"His...`
` his friend...?!`
` Ho, ho ho ho ho ho ho!`
` Rena-chan, you don't understand adult relationships yet, do you?"`
`"I do too!!`
`Come ooon, Tomitake-saaan.`
` Rena wants to take pictures of wild birds with you...`
` and if you want...`
` she can even dress up as a nurse and be your model, too..."`
`"Whaaaaaat?!`
` R-R-Really?!`
`No, wait, we can't, I already have Takano-san!!"`
`"You'd rather have someone who you've asked several times to let you take a picture of her in a nurse outfit, but never gave you the okay...?"`
`"H-H-How rude...`
` Jirou-san would never say anything like that."`
`"That's a lie!!!"`
`"Rena understands everything about you, Tomitake-san!`
` You say you're taking pictures of birds, but your eyes are always drifting to Takano-san instead!`
` Rena knows. `
`You don't want to take pictures of birds! You want to take pictures of her!`
` But all Takano-san does is say suggestive things, and won't let you take any pictures!`
` That's mean, and makes her a failure as a partner! `
`Rena will take her seat as your partner home with heeer~!!`
` Rena would be your model, Tomitake-san!`
` Come on, Tomitake-san...`
` For the nurse uniform...`
` White, or light blue and pink...`
` Which would you like... like?"`
`"Hu...`
` hu...`
` huoowaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!`
` Shh...`
` shh...`
` ppp...`
` hu`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`o`
`oh!!"`
`It looked like Tomitake's CPU finally experienced a thermal meltdown.`
`Steam burst from his ears and nose like a locomotive—and the sounds from his mouth were much the same—before he fainted.`
`"I-I don't care anymore!`
` Fine, go on, kindly teach Rena-chan all sorts of things!`
` I don't care, I don't care, I don't care!`
` I'm leaving, I'm leaving!!"`
`"Ahhh, we couldn't stop them from breaking up...`
` Satoko, aren't you ready yet?!"`
`"...Meep!`
` I'm okay here!!"`
`"I'm doing it!!"`
`Other than the mountains behind Hinamizawa, these shrine grounds were where the majority of Satoko's traps had been set!`
`She adjusted all their sights and aimed them at Rena!!`
`"Now! Fiiireee!!!"`
`"Huh?!"`
`Rocket-like objects flew at Rena from all sides!`
`It was a dangerous trap using remodeled bottle rockets. One that all you good children should never attempt to imitate!!`
`No... This could hardly be called a trap anymore.`
` It was a full-on warship barrage...`
`"S-So?!`
` Did it work?!"`
`"...I don't think that attack is enough to stop Rena while she's gone berserk..."`
`"But it's choking her!!`
` Keiichi-san, take Tomitake-san away while we have the chance!!"`
`"Take him away? I'll practically have to drag him!!"`
`"Hauuuu, why is everyone being so mean?!`
` Achoo, achoo, ahhh-choo!!"`
`"Ohhh ho ho ho ho!!`
` My bottle rocket spice mix—now with plenty of pepper!`
` Please enjoy your stay in a sneezing hell!!"`
`"W-Well, I got caught in it too!`
` Ah-choo, ah-choo!!"`
`"Anyway, let's hide behind the assembly hall for now!!`
` And then we'll search Mr. Tomitake's body!`
` I'm sure he's got that magatama somewhere!!"`
`"...He's frothing at the mouth, but he looks very happy.`
` But when he wakes up, it'll be terrible for him, I'm sure.`
` We should give him headpats while we can.`
` Meep~!"`
`We dragged Tomitake behind the assembly hall for now.`
`Rena was still stuck in a severe sneezing hell, but that wouldn't hold her off for very long.`
` She'd be over here in no time flat.`
`And not only that—she probably now thinks of us as obstacles in the way of her love, so she'll come at us in a pre-emptive attack, one utterly without mercy...!`
`"Come on, pat him down!`
` Fish around in his pockets and stuff!!"`
`"Small change, crumpled up receipts...`
` What a shameful collection of possessions!"`
`"...That's strange. I can't find it.`
` Tomitake-san has it, right?"`
`"...Hanyuu, you look too!`
` We have to find it before Rena gets here!"`
`"Ah, au au au,`
` of course I'm searching,`
` but well, I can't find it either...!"`
`"What?!`
` If you can't find it, doesn't that mean he doesn't have it?!`
` Then why was Rena chasing Tomitake?!`
` He doesn't have the magatama anymore!"`
`"Au au!`
` The Magatama of Fuwarazu stimulate the brain's love receptors, and makes your brain secrete the same chemicals as when you're in love.`
` That's how it creates false feelings of love, au au au! `
`The effects will still be active for a little while, even if Tomitake no longer has it...!"`
`We're too damn busy for your seemingly-sensible blathering!!`
`"What does that mean?!`
` Tomitake had it until a few moments ago, but doesn't anymore?!"`
`"What was that?!`
` Wait, then what'll happen to Rena?"`
`"Ahhh!!`
` Suddenly, she's nowhere to be seen!!`
` She must have gone looking for whoever has the magatama now!!"`
`"Th-That isn't good!`
` If we lose sight of Rena, we'll have no way of knowing who she's after now!"`
`"...Which means it would be faster to wake up this fool and ask him!"`
`I twisted a faucet that was conveniently nearby and pointed the hose at Tomitake's face.`
`"Uwah!!`
` Ack, ow...`
` wait......`
` it was a dream?`
` Was all that a dream...?!`
`Haha, Rena-chan offering to dress up like a nurse for a photoshoot... Haha, I knew it was strange. `
`And breaking up with Takano-san over it... Hahaha...`
` What a terrible dream that was."`
`"Ah, ahahahaha!`
` I-It's a good thing it was a dream!`
` Anyway, Tomitake-san!`
` You picked up a white magatama yesterday, right?!"`
`"Huh... what?`
` I don't know about any magatama.`
` But I did find a white key ring with a seal on it.`
` Here, look. We found it when we ran into Keiichi-kun at the dam site yesterday."`
`"...That's the key ring!`
` What happened?!"`
`"Right.`
` Well, I just gave it to Takano-san as a present.`
`She complained about me picking it up off the ground, but she still accepted it anyway! `
`She's really dishonest sometimes, which makes her all the more charming to me, tahahaha..."`
`"That means it's Takano-san!!`
` Where did Takano-san just go?!"`
`"I think, uh, the swamp is over that way!`
` Oh, no! Rena's already headed there!!"`
`"I... I see it doesn't matter that she's a woman...!`
` What a frightening effect...!!"`
`"...This pairing is a surprise to me, too."`
`I like to laugh at the misfortune of others, but she was a club member, so we couldn't leave her be.`
`We ran off toward the swamp.`
