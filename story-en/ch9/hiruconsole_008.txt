`"...The Magatama of Fuwarazu?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` We don't know how the one ended up flying into your mouth, but anyway, that's the kind of magic power they have."`
`"Then when someone picks up the white one, Rena falls in love with them, even if she doesn't mean it...?"`
`"That's the idea...`
` Your heart is literally lying around somewhere in the village."`
`"I-I don't want that...!`
` Hau...`
` The feeling of falling in love with someone should belong to me alone."`
`"...If it doesn't, Rena's true feelings will... Hau..."`
`"Ho ho, what's this?`
` Rena's true feelings?`
` Is there someone you like?`
` Why don't you tell this ol' man~?!"`
`"H-Hau~ I can't even tell you, Mii-chan!!"`
`"Gyphbghghphbhynn!!"`
`"M-Mion...`
` Try a little harder to understand a girl's heart...`
` Though it's weird for a man to say that."`
`"...If we find the white magatama, Rika-chan will do something about it, right...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So now we're desperate to find the white one before something terrible happens.`
` ...Though I think it's already caused a big uproar."`
`"...P-Please, Keiichi-kun.`
` Find the white magatama and save Rena...`
` I don't want someone else to have control over my feelings...`
` Uuuu..."`
`"R-Right!`
` I got it.`
` We'll save you, Rena!`
` ...So if the magatama's power takes hold of you again, please go easy on us...`
` Nobody can stop you when you're in kyute mode..."`
`"I-I can't..."`
`"It was like this with those two, but... My head got all filled with a fuzzy feeling... and I couldn't think about anything anymore...`
` So Rena doesn't think she'll have any mercy when it happens..."`
`"Before, when you all came, Rena wondered why you all got in her way.`
` So, I thought I'd have to send you flying into the stratosphere with my mach speed punches, ora ora ora ora oraaaa!"`
`"...I-I see...`
` Anyone Rena is fond of will be helpful in a few ways...`
` ...Aha, hahaha..."`
`"...Hau...`
` At this rate, I'll never be able to become a cute bride...`
` ...Hau..."`
`"Anyway, all we can do is keep searching.`
` ...For both Rena and the villagers, we have to settle this as soon as we can."`
`In the end, we could only go back along the route Takano-san had fled and look to see if it was lying anywhere.`
`But there was no way we could find a single jewel no bigger than the tip of your thumb.`
`When it started to get dark, everyone grew tired, and we started thinking about the more passive approach of waiting until Rena reacted to something...`
`"...E-Everyone, I'm sorry...`
` Rena's causing you so much trouble..."`
`"It isn't your fault.`
` You were just unlucky.`
` I'm sure we'll fix this together!"`
`"Okay..."`
`"It's late, though, so let's call it quits for today.`
` ...Rika-chan, could you read the scroll again to see if there's any better way to do this?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` Rika, to take responsibility for causing this disturbance, you're going to have a trial session with the tickle torture machine tomorrow."`
`"M-meeeep~~!!"`
`"...Oh my. Rika-chama, I didn't realize you were so interested in that machine? *grin*"`
`We decided to call off the search for the day.`
`I could only hope somebody normal picked it up...`
