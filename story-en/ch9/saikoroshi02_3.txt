`"Rika-chan.`
` Do you have a moment?"`
`After school, as I was about to head home before the rain started up again, Satoshi called out to me.`
`I looked up and saw Mion and Reina with him.`
` ...I'd been stopped by the upperclassmen brigade.`
`Their expressions weren't exactly gentle ones, and I suspected I was in for some sort of punishment after what I did during lunch break.`
`"......Do you need something from me?"`
`"Yeah.`
` We wanted to talk to you a little."`
`"...About lunch break?"`
`"Well, that too... Umm..."`
`"......I'm sorry for hitting Satoko with the chair and stuff."`
`I spoke the words fine, but didn't bother to hide my glum attitude.`
`"Please don't be scared, Rika-chan.`
` We're not here to scold you or anything like that."`
`"Then why are you...?"`
`"Well, I'll say it straight.`
` We need to talk about how to get along with everyone from now on."`
`"..............."`
`"It's just...`
` I just want you to understand something.`
` Some of the responsibility for things ending up this way belongs to you, Rika-chan."`
`"...Mion, you didn't have to say that..."`
`"I think it's an upperclassman's duty to explain these things.`
` ...Isn't it?"`
`"...Mmph."`
`This conversation didn't look like it would be a fun one.`
`If I blew them off, it would probably only get worse, so I decided to just pretend I was listening.`
`Reina took my silence for me being dispirited, and she started speaking in a much more lighthearted tone.`
`"Rika-chan, don't you think it'd be great if you could make friends with everyone and have lots of fun playing with them?"`
`"..............."`
`"So we were thinking...`
` We were thinking about what we could do so you could get along with everybody.`
` Ahahaha, what do you think about that? What do you?"`
`"......I don't know."`
`"You may not know this, Rika-chan, but Mion...`
` She collects a lot of games.`
` Right?"`
`"Well, it's an old hobby of mine.`
` When I was little, I collected a ton of board games and card games for some reason. `
`I haven't bothered with them at all recently, but I couldn't just get rid of them, so I have the whole lot piled up in storage."`
`"She has all these fun games, but she won't play them with anyone, so they're just collecting dust. What a waste, right?`
`I want to play that British burglar game where the thief puts on sunglasses!"`
`"I want to try the game where you connect tree branches like building blocks."`
`"But all the manuals are in English!`
` That Shion—reading those manuals was the only thing she was good at.`
` ...We could just ask her, but she goes to another school far away."`
`"Then we should all try to figure them out together.`
` I'm sure that will be fun."`
`"That's true.`
` If we all play by the same rules, then even if we're wrong, it'll still be fair."`
`"Well, doesn't that sound fun?`
` We were thinking about starting an after-school game club!"`
`"......A club...`
` for games."`
`"Everyone in class can play.`
` And while you're playing with everyone, I'm sure you'll eventually become part of their circle before you know it, Rika-chan."`
`"In other words, this is your upperclassmen being considerate and giving you the chance to fit in."`
`"Again, Mion, you don't have to say it like that..."`
`"I've felt a little sorry for you lately, but I actually think some of your current isolation is your own fault, Rika-chan."`
`My own... fault?`
`Reina and Satoshi fell silent after hearing that.`
`I guess everyone in class shares Mion's opinion.`
`"......My...`
` own fault?"`
`Of course, though this was about me, I had no idea what they meant by that.`
` They were talking about the Rika Furude before "I" came; to "me", she was the same as a stranger.`
`But to them, it must have seemed like my surprised tone was just me not understanding because I was young.`
`They sighed a little.`
`It was an unpleasant sigh, like they were telling me to look at myself.`
` ...I wanted to be freed from this as soon as possible.`
`"Before everyone moved away...`
` Rika-chan, you were kinda like a princess, weren't you?"`
`"......I was...`
` a princess?"`
`"Yep.`
` A princess.`
` ...Rika-chan, you were like a princess to that group of boys. You had them wrapped around your little finger.`
` You didn't even need to do anything, you just let them act for you. `
`...Do you remember Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun?`
` They seemed to like you a lot, so they'd do whatever you told them to.`
` You just sat on your reputation, unconcerned. `
`And you'd do things like make the boys who liked you compete, so you could always get the best deal, like a war profiteer.`
` A lot of kids didn't think that was very fair. `
`So when those boys all moved out at the same time, by coincidence, and only you were left behind, some of those kids thought you got what you deserved."`
`......None of that...`
` was about "me."`
`............`
`"...Rika-chan.`
` We're talking about you.`
` Please listen to what Mii-chan is saying."`
`"............I am."`
`"No, you're not.`
` ...Rika-chan, you think it doesn't have anything to do with you.`
` ...Am I right?"`
`...Whether Rena or Reina, she was still just as sharp about the weirdest things.`
`...I wanted to believe it was just a wild guess, but she had hit the nail right on the head.`
`"Reina, you stop too...`
` I think Rika-chan has thought about it enough already..."`
`"I wonder.`
`She still hasn't said so.`
` It seems to me like she didn't realize it until we told her."`
`"Come on, stop it!`
` We're not here to bully Rika-chan.`
`We really want her to be friends with everyone, right?`
` That means we all have to work hard to change our relationships with each other."`
`".................."`
`...For some reason, I was upset.`
`Because it was as though they weren't talking about Rika Furude...`
` but about "me."`
`Me...`
` a princess...`
` ......`
`There was no guarantee I wasn't one until now.`
`...Loved the most of all the club members... Rena and the boys in the class pampering me, laughing at Satoko and Keiichi's failures as I coolly profited from their conflict.`
`Without giving anything myself, I just greedily devoured the good will people poured upon me.`
`...They were right. That was "me."`
`..."I" hadn't wanted to accept this sad, lonely world, and set myself apart.`
`But, of course, they couldn't have actually been talking about "me."`
`So... though I didn't know the reason, I was still upset.`
`"We were thinking of having Satoko join the club too.`
` ...She's really stubborn, so she won't say it, but she wants to get along with you, Rika-chan."`
`"How does that sound?`
` Do you want to try being in our game club, Rika-chan?`
` I'm sure it will be a lot of fun~!"`
`"...Or, think of it this way.`
` Do you want to...`
` start putting in a little bit of effort to change yourself?"`
`"Some things might be awkward at first.`
`...But I'm sure you'll get along with everyone sooner or later.`
` After all, everyone wants to be your friend, `
`and if you want to be their friend too... then you're both reaching out your hands.`
` I'm sure you'll meet in the middle."`
`"And look, we're... already reaching out to you.`
` All you have to do is grab hold, Rika-chan."`
`......I felt like Keiichi said something a lot like that in some other world.`
`Those words... probably made Rika Furude really happy.`
`But that wasn't "me."`
` ...All this only applied to the Rika Furude from before I possessed this body.`
`For "me," this world was fake. A dream world...`
` and besides, I was in the middle of a hunt.`
` I didn't...`
` have time to hang out with them.`
`But they weren't faking their feelings for Rika Furude...`
` and I found myself without an answer, at a loss for how to respond to them.`
`"...We're sorry, Rika-chan.`
` ...To tell the truth...`
` when we went to wash our hands, and you were talking with Yamamoto-sensei in the nurse's office...`
` we might have overheard you a tiny bit."`
`Reina gave me an apologetic look.`
`...I never thought others would be listening to that conversation, which must have sounded like garbled nonsense to anyone from this world...`
`I'd understand if it weirded them out and they didn't want to come near me...`
` but I couldn't quite understand why it had resulted in this.`
`"...The world you were talking about, Rika-chan... It sounds like a really fun world, where everyone gets along together.`
` ...You said you wanted to go back there, right, Rika-chan?"`
`".................."`
`"So we talked, and... thought about how we could bring you back there."`
`"...Still, it's not like we can call back Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun now that they moved."`
`"Yep.`
` I think everyone wants to go back to that old world... but I think that's definitely impossible."`
`"......Huh?"`
`That startled me.`
` ...There was no way Reina knew about "me" and my "old world."`
`Even still... her words felt full of meaning, and they echoed in my heart...`
`"...You can gather all the fragments of the cup together, but they're just fragments.`
` Once it breaks, it can't go back to the way it was."`
`"..............."`
`"But there's more than one cup.`
` It's a shame the cup broke, but you can always look for another one.`
` But if you look down at the broken cup forever, you'll never, ever find it."`
`"...Here's what we mean, Rika-chan.`
` You can't get your good friends who moved away to come back here...`
` so you just have to make new friends who are just as good as they were."`
`"I think a world like that would be really close to the one you came from, Rika-chan.`
` ...It wouldn't be exactly the same, of course.`
` But I think it's as close as you're going to get."`
`"And by doing that...`
` you can make even stronger relationships than you had before.`
` You know what they say—when it rains, the ground gets harder. Or something like that, anyway."`
`"What do you think,`
` Rika-chan?`
` We'll help out, so you can make new friends quickly.`
` Would you like to give it a try?"`
`"........................"`
`Those gentle words would have been tearworthy if they'd been said to this world's Rika Furude.`
`...But now that "I" had possessed her, she was gone.`
`...The Rika Furude they were talking to was no longer of this world.`
`......I thought to myself that I should just give this body back to her.`
`If I did, the me living in this remote parallel universe would have the chance to change her fate and make this world a happy one, if only little by little.`
`...If I went back to my old world, and gave this leftover body back to Rika Furude...`
`But I couldn't do that.`
`Because for "me" to leave this world... would require the same method as returning the Fragment from this world to the world of the gods.`
`In other words, "my" death.`
`Only "my" death could make "me" go away.`
`...Which meant at the point "I" took over for Rika Furude, she was the same as dead.`
`......But, maybe, just maybe, there was one way to return this body to Rika Furude.`
`That would be for "me" to die a different way.`
`..."I" wasn't a parasite or anything.`
`...In difficult-to-understand terms, I was an individual personality aware of other universes.`
` Or maybe I should call myself a memory aware of other universes.`
`And that meant...`
` that if I could forget about the other worlds, that would represent the same thing as "me" dying.`
`This world was the only world for Rika Furude, and she would live the best she could in it.`
`...If so, "I" would gradually forget...`
` eventually losing my grasp on which world I had lived in...`
` and try my hardest to live in the world I was in now.`
`...Which meant...`
` that giving up on my previous world,`
` and living in this one,`
` was possible simply if "I" decided to do it.`
`Like Reina said, it might be a different world than my old one... but it was the closest I could ever get.`
`It might be a little different from my old world, but the club would still form.`
`In exchange for Keiichi and half our classmates, Satoshi was here.`
`I wasn't best friends with Satoko, but depending on how we interacted in the future, we could at least become regular friends.`
`Hinamizawa would sink underwater in another six months... but I could work hard to make new friends in my new home.`
`That cruel destiny wasn't Rika Furude's alone... it was an impartial destiny, shared equally by all who lived in this "world."`
`Only "I" had the luxury of being a special case and jumping between destinies at a whim...`
`......"I"...`
` didn't know.`
`Which world should I devote myself to...?`
`Reina's words came back to me.`
`A broken cup never went back to normal.`
` And I couldn't find another one as long as I was lamenting the first.`
`......What did the cup represent?`
`...Cups were for filling with water.`
`The water could probably be called happiness.`
`The cup broke, and the happiness inside was scattered everywhere.`
` ...The cup was broken, and I was at a loss, unable to fill it with happiness again...`
`But if I could change the way I thought, and rather than be attached to the broken cup forever, fill a new cup with new happiness...`
` it could open the door to a new world.`
`Still, while that world might be similar, it wouldn't be the same.`
`...My heart had weakened, and I'd been discouraged... Wasn't this only so tempting because my search for the key to go back was so difficult?`
`Before, didn't I swear I'd put in any effort I needed to return to my old world?`
`If I broke that oath, Hanyuu, gambling on my fate, would be left behind for all eternity, all alone... and I'd be the only one so selfishly happy.`
`...While I didn't have any responsibility to make Hanyuu happy......`
` she was my ally and partner who stuck with me for a hundred years...`
` and my friend.`
`So... even if I wanted to give in to temptation, I'd have to ask Hanyuu.`
`Which meant... right now, "I" had no right to answer their proposal.`
`"...Really......`
` thank you.`
` ...I'm very happy..."`
`"It's all right.`
` We'll protect you.`
` So let's make lots of good memories before we have to leave."`
`"No, I...`
` well...`
` ...`
` ...Could you give me time to prepare my feelings?"`
`"Whaaa?`
` What's with that girlish response all of a sudden?`
` It's not like Satoshi just asked you out on a date or anything."`
`"Mii-chan, that wasn't necessary.`
` ...I can understand how she feels, just a little.`
` So we'll wait for you to prepare your feelings, Rika-chan."`
`"...Thank you.`
` ......If...`
` If I do accept...`
` then please, let this Rika Furude be one of your friends..."`
`I bowed apologetically...`
`Here and now, that was the most I could do...`
`...After refusing their suggestion that we all go home together, I left on my own.`
`It was Rika Furude's right, not mine, to enjoy going home with them.`
`It wasn't something "I," Frederica Bernkastel, could accept...`
`What was "I," anyway...?`
`I wondered if another ball could fly into my head like before.`
`That was how this world's Rika Furude was possessed by "me."`
`So if I got hit again, would "I" vanish, and the pure Rika Furude who lives in this world return...?`
`If only I wasn't "me," I wouldn't hesitate to take them up on their offer.`
`This world truly was far sadder than the one I'd come from.`
`...But this world had something all its own... and the opportunity to become a happy world in its own right.`
`If I hadn't known about the other worlds, I wouldn't have been able to contain tears of joy at the mere premonition of happiness I might once again attain.`
`......Were these conflicting emotions those of this world's Rika Furude, sleeping inside of "me"?`
`Those emotions made "me" angry, and I blamed myself, asking why I'd put their offer on hold and went home all alone...`
`"...I'm back."`
`"Welcome home."`
`...My mother always immediately followed that up with a "do you have homework," but not today.`
`"Rika?`
` Come into the kitchen."`
`Her voice was vaguely cheerful and light.`
`I wondered what it was—did she want to surprise me, in a good way?`
`...But I couldn't remember today being special.`
`...A person's expectations sometimes come out in their voice.`
`For the time being, it felt okay to go poke my head in.`
` I set down my things and headed for the kitchen.`
`When I entered, my mother had already started on dinner, despite it being so early.`
`She was in a good mood; I wonder if something nice happened.`
`...Every year at this time, with the Watanagashi Festival approaching, she usually got more and more impatient with all the preparations and setup.`
`Knowing all that, my mother's good mood baffled and confused me.`
`I asked if she needed something.`
` When I did, she suggested something I'd never heard even once in these hundred years.`
`"Come over here and help me make dinner. We're having curry today.`
` Let's make something wonderful and surprise your father with it."`
`"..................I...`
` ......uh-huh."`
`I didn't like curry that much.`
` ...But,`
` before these hundred years...`
` meaning not "me," but Rika Furude...`
` I think she might have liked it.`
`I knew, at least, that my mother was trying to make her daughter happy in suggesting she and Rika Furude, not "I," make dinner together.`
`...I didn't like my mother that much.`
`She was prone to hysterics, and I hated how she always sounded like she was hunting you down when she talked.`
`...When she treated me so nicely, my reason for disliking her felt irrational.`
`Wondering why my mother had had a change of heart, I decided to go along with it so as not to hurt her feelings.`
`"Then you can peel the potatoes.`
` ...Can you do it with a knife?`
` Actually, that's dangerous, so use the peeler instead."`
`"...Okay."`
`I was actually rather good with a knife.`
` I was so good that when I peeled daikon radishes, I could make a long strip of skin at the same time I sliced them.`
`...But there was no reason to damage my mother's pride by showing that her daughter could use knives better than her.`
` ...I decided to make her look good for now.`
`My mother had probably been using knives for a decade now... but I'd been using them for many decades.`
` There was an order of magnitude's difference between us.`
`So I wanted to be proud of using a knife better than my mother.`
` I wanted to brag about it.`
` ...But that might have trampled over her feelings, her want to teach her daughter how to use a knife.`
`......Parents are supposed to live longer than their children.`
`So children respect the things their parents have learned from having lived longer than them.`
`But... witches like me live longer than their parents and learn many more things.`
`...Still, I think I probably never learned what I really needed to.`
`I mean... As long as I genuinely listened to my mother, she'd never get hysterical.`
`...If I didn't feel like respecting her as my senior in life, she wouldn't feel like she needed to act as one, either.`
`...In the end, all that was left was a cold, uncomfortable relationship between parent and child.`
`If I had acted more like a daughter and pretended to be an ignorant child when I needed to be... maybe my relationship with her would have been more peaceful, like this.`
`...Basically, she was Rika Furude's mother.`
` Not the mother of the witch who'd lived for a hundred years.`
` Thinking about it made it seem obvious she'd be cold to "me."`
`"So first we put the ones in the pot that take the longest to cook."`
`"Okay.`
` ......When do we put in the onions...?"`
`"The onions will melt if we cook them too long, so we can leave them for last.`
` You worked so hard on cutting the onions, too.`
` I'm sure they'll taste delicious."`
`".....................`
` ...Okay."`
`My mother smiled. She seemed very happy.`
`Her smile... was warm.`
`I thought I'd completely forgotten over these hundred years... but I remembered, for less than a moment in time.`
`...My parents had to die in 1981.`
` That fate was unchangeable.`
` And besides, we could never get along in the first place, so it didn't matter if they died...`
`As thoughts like those overlapped, maybe my concern with my parents had waned...`
` our hearts had steadily lost their connection...`
` and the situation had steadily worsened.`
`Before now, I hadn't thought I could gain anything from this world... Not once did I think it would make me realize something like that.`
`...With a mother like this......`
` ......Maybe spending time with her would be warm. It would be fun.`
`That's right...`
` The reason I rejected my mother's warmth......`
` Maybe it was because I wanted to soften the sadness I felt at her death.`
`...If I couldn't change the fate she met in 1981, then she might as well hate me.`
` ......Was that the idea at the root of it all...?`
`In this world, my mother hadn't died in 1981.`
` ...She would stay here for a long time to come...`
`...I felt... just a little jealous of Rika Furude.`
`And...... I was stricken with the desire... to return this world's "me" to her.`
`...This world was so different than my previous one.`
`Keiichi wasn't here.`
` Shion wasn't here.`
` Hanyuu wasn't here.`
`But in exchange, Satoshi and my parents were here.`
`There was no club.`
` But there would be one soon.`
`Satoko wasn't my best friend.`
` But she could be in the future.`
`I could weigh my previous world and this one on the scales...`
` but I wouldn't know which way it would tip.`
`......I decided to leave this decision up to Hanyuu.`
`Yes.`
` My destiny wasn't mine alone.`
`...It was Hanyuu's destiny too.`
`Whichever I chose, I would have to talk to Hanyuu before making my final decision.`
`This multiple world concept was something I only had because Hanyuu had lent me her power.`
`If Hanyuu had never given it to me... it would have been over from the very start.`
`Takano would have sliced open my belly, and that would have been it.`
`We put the lid on the curry, so now it just had to simmer.`
`My father returned in the meantime, and really enjoyed seeing us making curry together.`
`Then, at my mother's suggestion, he set the table.`
`...In any normal 1981, he really hated it when my mother told him to do anything.`
`...But he wasn't troubled at all at the prospect in this world.`
`"Rika, put the rice on everyone's plates, please.`
` Can you do that?"`
`"Yep.`
` I can."`
`Of course I can do that, idiot...`
` is something I'd thought many times before.`
` ...But this time, I didn't.`
`I opened the warm, steaming rice cooker and plated the rice.`
`My mother brought the piping hot curry pot over and split it among everyone's plates.`
`"Oh, nice!`
` So Mom made curry for the rice Rika served, huh?`
` It looks delicious!"`
`"He's wrong, isn't he?`
` Saying that even though we made the curry together. Isn't he such a rude father?"`
`"Meep☆."`
`............I peeled "myself" back.`
`Furude Rika shouted that "I" wasn't needed, so I pulled back.`
`"I" withdrew inside Rika Furude... and she got to enjoy a family dinner from the bottom of her heart.`
`When we saw the crooked potatoes, we all laughed pleasantly.`
`"I" would never cut potatoes to be so ugly.`
` ...But Rika Furude was still bad at this, so these things happened.`
`...When I used the same ingredients, the only thing curry tasted like was the curry powder from the store.`
`After a hundred years with the same curry powder, it tasted the same, no matter how you made it...`
` ...but this particular curry tasted different.`
`"I" cried at what Rika Furude had lost...`
` no, at what I had lost.`
`Rika Furude got to experience the warmth she had once forgotten.`
`I wondered if another ball would come flying and hit me in the head...`
`...Then I would pass out for a while...`
` and upon waking again, "I" would be gone.`
`...Wasn't that...`
` the best possible happy ending?`
`"I"...`
` was the stranger here.`
`I thought this universe was the strange one from out of all the other parallel universes, but it was me; "I" was the stranger.`
`Then... what had that world been, the one "I" had reached after a hundred years?`
`Was its happiness that we'd all won... Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Satoko, Shion, and I... was it all worth nothing...?`
`That wasn't true.`
`It was a radiant world, one we'd all won the right to live in after a hundred years of learning to trust in each other.`
`It was replete with a different kind of happiness than this one.`
`Both shone brightly, and neither was better or worse than the other.`
`...Maybe, in the end, most worlds weren't better or worse than any other.`
`I only lived in the extreme worlds, the ones where I struggled to see whether Takano killed me or not.`
`So out of all the infinite universes, I'd started to think of them as either "right" or "wrong."`
`But the multiverse wasn't simple enough to think of in binaries like that.`
`Tomorrow's dinner might be steak or salted saury.`
` It wasn't about which was right and which was wrong.`
` In both of those worlds, I'd spend a happy time eating dinner with family. `
`What if my respective "selves" had been reversed during tonight's dinner?`
` But that was an incredibly tasteless thing to ask... The real problem wasn't that big to begin with.`
`............Neither my last world nor this world was better than the other.`
`I needed to accept that.`
`I still didn't know where the Fragment I needed to return to my world was.`
`But... What if I never knew... and the power of the crystal ball connecting me to Hanyuu disappeared?`
`......"I" would disappear like the stranger I was...`
` and give this body back to Rika Furude.`
`From her point of view, she would have to say that "I" had returned to my old world.`
`Just as "I" once called this world a daydream, for Rika Furude, "my" old world was the real daydream.`
` Her strange delusions of "me" would simply disappear along with it.`
`...Maybe it didn't really matter... how to return to my original world.`
`Which world would "I" decide was the original?`
`...Maybe that was really all this was about.`
`After we finished eating, we cleaned up our places and started washing things.`
`My father said he had a meeting tonight, and he was about to leave again.`
`"Rika, could you wash these for me?`
` I have something to talk with Dad about, so please do the rest."`
`"Okay."`
`I responded cheerfully, as Rika Furude.`
`But "I" had realized something slightly out of place.`
`If she had something to talk to my father about, there were plenty of chances during dinner.`
`But she made me wash the dishes so they could talk amongst themselves.`
`...Rika just had to stay put and wash the dishes.`
`...But "I" couldn't suppress the curiosity that was welling up, and so snuck over to the front door to listen in on what my parents were saying.`
`My mother was the one talking.`
` Her tone of voice... wasn't a cheery one.`
`"Yamamoto-sensei is discussing it with a big hospital in the city.`
` ...From what he said, it might be her heart more than her brain...`
` Apparently there's a wonderful doctor there who can help."`
`...............I knew it...`
` I knew I shouldn't have asked.`
`...Yamamoto certainly hadn't promised to keep our discussion in the nurse's office to himself.`
`As soon as I left, he'd probably called my parents.`
` ...And told them their daughter was ranting about nonsense.`
`He probably explained it as my isolation at school wearing down on my mind and damaging my heart.`
`......Considering what I'd told him, even that would be a conscientious interpretation.`
`"...Did you talk to Rika about it?"`
`"I will after this...`
` I mean, it feels like we're tricking her...`
` Given that tomorrow, the doctor will be here and we'll suddenly be off to the hospital."`
`"..............."`
`"...But, you know, when I think about how she feels, I can understand.`
` Her friends got up and moved away, leaving her all alone.`
` ...I should have tried to understand her feelings... `
`Rika's always been saying she didn't want to move.`
` ...We didn't wait for her to deal with that, and we made her repress it..."`
`".........When is Yamamoto-sensei coming tomorrow?"`
`"He said the evening, but he didn't give me an exact time.`
` He said he'd prefer it if you were there too."`
`"I'll be in the assembly hall tomorrow, so when he gets here, give me a call."`
`"All right."`
`"...Don't be discouraged.`
` ...I understand why she's saying she wants to go back to her 'original world'...`
` but there's nothing we can do anymore.`
` This was decided between the village and the national government. `
`...I at least want to give her some fun things to look back on when she remembers living in Hinamizawa."`
`"...You're right..."`
`"It's time, so I'll get going.`
` ...I'll leave...`
` Rika to you."`
`"All right.`
` ...Come back safely."`
`I snuck back into the kitchen the same as I'd come.`
`...But I think the floorboards must have creaked.`
`When my mother returned to the kitchen, she still didn't sound particularly cheerful.`
`"...Were you listening, Rika?"`
`"..............."`
`"...Yamamoto-sensei called us today.`
` ...He told us what you talked to him about."`
`".........Meep.`
` Yamamoto's really mean for talking about it without asking me."`
`"Rika... I'm sorry.`
` You wanted to live in this village forever, didn't you?`
` We never thought about your feelings, and I think we said a lot of pretty harsh things to you..."`
`"......It's okay.`
` It doesn't really bother me."`
`My mother's apology was meant to be heard by the Rika Furude living in this world.`
` It wasn't for "me" to accept, so I denied it.`
`But my mother kept apologizing anyway.`
` ......"I" was going to deny it again...`
` but I stopped.`
`It wasn't "my" turn.`
` "I" should pull back.`
`...And then... I thought I felt "myself"... begin to fade out.`
`As I did... I felt my eyes grow warm.`
`The rest was, for "me," a misty, hazy world.`
`I cried as I buried my face in my mother's chest.`
` ...And my mother cried as well as she hugged me.`
`............If I could have disappeared like that...`
`This, too... might have been...`
` Rika Furude's life.`
`After that, my mother told a lot of stories of Hinamizawa, as if to reminisce about her own childhood.`
`About what she was like as a kid, what she did, and where.`
` About things happening, or not happening.`
`As she talked... we comforted each other, both of us wanting our beloved village to stay in our hearts forever.`
`"And when your mom was little, all the elderly people in the village treated me like I was really important.`
` That was because they believed I was the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama."`
`"...Oyashiro-sama's...`
` reincarnation...?"`
`"I've never told you, have I?`
` There's an old legend in the Furude family.`
` If there are eight first children in a row who are girls, that eighth girl is said to be the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama. `
`That girl happened to be me."`
`"...N-Not me?"`
`"You're our first child, and a girl, but you would be the ninth one.`
` We have a maternal line, I suppose.`
` Your mom is the eighth.`
` Oyashiro-sama's reincarnation.`
` ...But this is a secret, okay? `
`We have to make sure not to tell anyone about it.`
` The only ones who know are your late grandmother, me, and you.`
` It's a secret between the two of us, okay?"`
`...Sometimes, as proof of trust between girls, they reveal secrets to one another.`
`...For my mother, this was probably a trivial secret that she could use for that reason.`
`...But for "me," it was different.`
`Hanyuu was first able to appear before the eighth of eight consecutive generations of girls. Before Oyashiro-sama's reincarnation.`
`But in this world, Rika Furude wasn't the eighth.`
`She wasn't Oyashiro-sama's reincarnation.`
`So...`
`In this world, Hanyuu couldn't appear before Rika Furude...`
`And that was when...`
` with my face buried in my mother's chest,`
` I felt a warmth...`
` ...no, a literal heat.`
`Does she have a fever...?`
` No.`
`...This felt..................`
` the same...`
` as Hanyuu's power.`
`Well, this was a secret.`
`With my grandmother dead, there was only one who knew my mother was Oyashiro-sama's reincarnation: the woman herself.`
`Which meant... if my mother was gone...`
` "The Fragment of there already being a reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama in this world" would disappear...!!`
`My warm tears ceased to flow...`
` and I felt my eyes drying up as I plummeted to the bottom of the abyss of despair...`
`...It was her.`
`Mom had the Fragment in her...`
`If I could have...`
` I would have chosen never to remember what that fact entailed......`
