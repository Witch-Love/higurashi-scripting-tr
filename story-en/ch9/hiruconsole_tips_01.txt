`"...Anyway, a matchmaking magatama, huh?`
` Depending how it's used, that might be able to lead toward world peace."`
`"World peeeace?`
` That seems like a rather large-scale proposal.`
` Just how might you go about that?"`
`"Here's what you do.`
` Give it to the leaders of two countries that are in the middle of some kinda dispute.`
` That way, they'd be able to get along and live happily ever after."`
`"...There's no way that would solve all of a country's problems.`
` Even if the higher ups are able to reconcile, it won't change anything unless the people around them are able to come to an agreement.`
` The two of them would just be forced out of their jobs, don't you think?"`
`"Plus, that magatama only gives you one-sided affection with no consideration for your partner's feelings.`
` I think that's a little different from genuinely liking someone.`
` That's more like dependence or servitude... not a very happy feeling."`
`"Ultimately, love is only possible when two people like and understand one another, that's what Rena thinks."`
`"Well, in that sense, if national change is too much to ask for, then the same could probably be said for trust between friends.`
` Using some convenient tool to make people like each other without any reason or rationale just sounds too good to be true."`
`"In the end, even if it's unrefined, the important thing is developing mutual understanding."`
`"Hmm~, understanding, huh?`
` That's an easy thing to say, but pretty tough to actually do.`
` You might think you're trying to be considerate of someone close to you, but in a lot of cases they were thinking something completely different..."`
`"Maybe it's arrogant to be thinking for someone else's sake in the first place.`
` Because when you think like that, you're totally putting yourself on a higher pedestal than the other person."`
`"In which case, there are times when it's better to share our true feelings with one another so we can deepen our understanding of each other."`
`"...This story is very deep. Meep."`
`"...Hohoh?`
` Then Sis, why don't you share your true feelings with Kei-chan, right here and now?`
` You might be surprised how deeply you'll be able to understand one another~."`
`"Huh?`
` N-no, well, th-this and that are, umm..."`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Mion? You've got something to tell me?`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"Th-th-th-there's no way I can say thaaaat!!"`
`"...`
` Hey Rena... why did Mion just beat me and then storm out?`
` Right, maybe this is another thing I should be asking the person in question directly?"`
`"I wondeeer?`
` Rena doesn't knoooow~♪."`
`"Unbelievable...`
` Are they both equally clueless?`
` The road ahead is going to be full of difficulties."`
`"...Although, perhaps expecting Keiichi-san to be more understanding on this matter is too much to ask for."`
`"That is the cliche for a galge protagonist, nipah☆."`
