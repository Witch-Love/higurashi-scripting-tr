`The next day, Saturday.`
`Coach was waiting for us there... along with the Hinamizawa Fighters and the Okinomiya Titans.`
`In other words, this was...`
`"A-a baseball fieeeeld?!"`
`And what's more, today was apparently joint practice day for both teams.`
`"Aah, I knew it...`
` I figured it might be the case, since he deliberately waited overnight and specified this location."`
`"Unbelievable!`
` I wish he'd just stop this nonsense and hand it over so we can resolve this already!"`
`"...Meep, this is such a roundabout way of doing things."`
`"No, no, it's not like that at all!`
` In this contest, I'm putting the ambitions I always envisioned at stake!"`
`"Whether it gets fulfilled or I have to give in, I must demonstrate the strength of my feelings to you all who stand before me!!"`
`"Okay, okay, I get it... Sheesh."`
`Incidentally, Rena fought back when we tried bringing her home afterwards, so after the scuffle we gave her some of Coach's special sleeping pills, and she was now sleeping soundly. She shouldn't wake up until close to this evening.`
`Normally that would've left her absent from school, but today is a holiday for teachers.`
`And that's why all of us can head to Okinomiya early in the morning without any hesitation.`
`Hmm? ...All of us?`
`"Hey, Shion.`
` I thought your school wasn't closed today...?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh really~? Is that so?"`
`...Well, whatever. Seems like she skipped yesterday too, so let's not pry too deep into it.`
`"Anyway, let's settle this already, and get that magatama back!`
` All right Coach, what's the game?!`
` We'll take you at anything, bring it on!!"`
`"Heh heh heh... It's quite simple.`
` We'll settle it right here, in a home run derby!!"`
`"H-home run derbyyy?!"`
`"Yes!`
` You may select power hitters from the Hinamizawa Fighters, and the contest will be decided by how many home runs our representatives hit out of 10 at-bats!"`
`"And if there's a tie after 10 at-bats, we'll go into sudden death until one team pulls ahead!`
` So, how about it? Do you accept the terms?"`
`"Yeah, fantastic!!`
` By the way, we're allowed to choose the pitcher we use against the opposing batter, right?"`
`"That should be fine.`
` All right then, the representative of the Hinamizawa Fighters will be..."`
`"Hello, helloooo!`
` Rena Ryuugu, present~♪."`
`""H-huuuuuh?!""`
`"H-hold on, Rena!`
` Weren't you knocked out on sleeping pills?!"`
`...When I looked at Coach, he seemed just as surprised. So that means he didn't intend for this to happen?`
`"R-Ryuugu-san?`
` How did you wake up?`
` That should've been a large enough dose of sleeping pills to put an elephant under for an entire day?!"`
`"...Hold on Coach, that's definitely a lethal dose for a human, isn't it?"`
`"Aahahahahaha!`
` That's the power of love, Master♪.`
` If anyone even thinks of breaking the bond between Rena and her master, I'll beat them to death with this bat~♪."`
`"...L-love? Master?`
` Wh-whooooaaaaa?!`
` That's my Super Maid, master of the ways of maid-craft!!`
` Then, Ryuugu-san!`
` I'll leave everything to you!!`
` Please, take them down!!"`
`"Understood!!"`
`Hey, don't just go deciding things on a whim, Coach.`
`...I mean, Rena isn't even a member of the Hinamizawa Fighters, is she?`
`The team members behind me stroking their arms were all clearly sulking.`
`Sure hope this won't be a problem next time I lead them...`
`"O-oh no, Keiichi-san...!`
` Look, Rena-san used to help out the Fighters from time to time, and she was even more of a power slugger than Mion-san, you know? `
`Any run of the mill pitcher would be calling for a substitute!!"`
`"Hmph... Don't worry, Satoko!`
` I thought this might happen, so yesterday I called in one of my strongest helpers.`
` ...Come on, you're up!! Kameda-kuuun!!!"`
`"Gah ha ha ha!!`
` I've been waiting for you to holler, Keeeeei!!"`
`And then, stepping onto the scene and standing firm, was the Koshien class ace pitcher, Kameda-kun!!`
`He's usually a hot-blooded idiot who loves sweets, but in uniform he's a completely different person, a total wizard!!`
`His full power fastballs are impossible to hit, even for Rena!!`
`"Please, Kameda-kun!`
` Lend us that iron arm of yours for the rest of the day!!"`
`"Don't treat me like a stranger, Keeeei!!`
` We're comrades who dug into jumbo parfaits together!!`
` We're sworn friends, brothers even!!`
` I am always willing to rush to your side at times like these, K!!"`
`"All riiiight!!`
` I thought you'd say that, pal!!"`
`Then, we gave each other a firm handshake of passionate friendship. ...Mion and the others behind us were staring at us with cold white eyes, but I dared to ignore them in the moment.`
`"Which means!`
` Rena, your opponent here is Kameda-kun!!`
` Even you are no match for him!!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha!!`
` Keiichi-kun, you're too soft, too soft!!`
` Rena has been waking up early in the mornings to read biographies of major leaguers, just in case something like this might happen!! `
`Don't go thinking this'll be easy and things will go how you expect, all right~??"`
`"...Umm, Mion-san.`
` Does reading biographies of baseball players actually do anything to improve your baseball skills?"`
`"Wh-who knows...`
` This ol' man doesn't think those things are all that related though..."`
`"...Meep.`
` I'm sure this is like the misconception viewers have that watching fighting movies makes you stronger."`
`...At any rate, the representative of Coach's team (which you can't really call the Hinamizawa Fighters) is Rena. And the pitcher going against her is Kameda-kun.`
`Meanwhile, the representative of the club members' team will be me, Keiichi Maebara!`
`And the pitcher facing off against me will be...`
`"Hey, to keep things neutral here, how about I also pitch to K... I mean, Keiichi Maebara?"`
`"Oh?`
` You'd do that for me, Kameda-kun?!`
` Ah, sorry, then let's do th..."`
`"Kameda!!"`
`"...?!"`
`"Ahahahahaha. Kameda-kun, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...No cheating, all right?`
` You two aren't scheming anything, are you?"`
`"W-we're not scheming anythi..."`
`"That's a lie!!"`
`"I know how close the two of you are, all right?`
` So Kameda-kun, I'm sure you're planning to go easy on Keiichi-kun when you're pitching to him.`
` Wasn't that your plan? I'm not mistaken, am I? ...Am I? `
`Ahahahahahahahaha."`
`"I-I... was...!!"`
`"So, Keiichi-kun?`
` When you're at-bat, Rena will be the one pitching.`
` But don't worry, it'll be all right.`
` It's not like I'd aim for your head or anything.`
` Ahahahahahahaha."`
`"R-right..."`
`The scary thing is, you can't tell if she's joking or not...`
`Meanwhile, the first at-bat was about to begin.`
`Rena was at the plate, and Kameda-kun was on the mound.`
`"All right, let us begin!`
` As coach of the Hinamizawa Fighters, I, Kyousuke Irie, will serve as the umpire!`
` Balls don't count, so pitchers, please keep your pitches in the strike zone."`
`"And everyone else from both teams, you're in charge of retrieving the balls from the outfield~!!"`
`""...Okaaay~...""`
`...Sorry for getting you all involved in this stupid showdown right before you were supposed to have a game together.`
`Some of the kids even muttered "Maybe I should go home today..."`
`"...Heh.`
` Can't believe that I, Kameda-sama, am playing a serious match against a girl.`
` Let me tell ya, my fastballs are pretty darn fast, all right~?`
` If you wanna throw in the towel, now's the time."`
`"...The weaker the dog, the harder they bark.`
` Whatever, bring it on... Parfait Man."`
`"...!`
` Then take this!!"`
`Kameda-kun's fastball came in on Rena's inside corner!!`
` But...`
`*craaaack*`
`"...N-nwhaaaaa?!"`
`Rena took a full swing at Kameda-kun's fastball, easily made contact, and... it went flying beyond the home run line, far off in the distance.`
`"I-incredible...?!"`
`"N-no way...?!`
` E-even in the regional qualifiers, nobody's ever managed to hit one of my full speed straight pitches...??"`
`"All right, with that, Rena claims the first point of the game!`
` ...Okay, you're up next, Keiichi-kun.`
` Step up to the batter's box."`
`"Y-yeah...!"`
`I faced Rena as she quickly strode to the pitcher's mound, then entered the batter's box and readied my bat.`
`"Let's go!!"`
`Rena slowly raised her leg from the pitcher's set position, and then from her shoulder to her elbow to her wrist, she tossed the ball in a thoroughly efficient maneuver.`
`"...?!"`
`Coming down the center, a little low... S-so fast?!`
`I felt lost, but I somehow managed to put strength into my grip, and then...!!`
