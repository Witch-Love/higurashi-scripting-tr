`"...Ah, geez!`
` How unpleasant, how utterly unpleasant!`
` ...How could Jirou-san fawn over a girl that much younger than him?!`
` I mean, I suppose I'm not honest with him all the time!`
` Whenever he asks me for something, I like to refuse at first, just to tease him!`
`...But I wish he would understand that it's only because I really do like him!`
` I mean, if Jirou-san absolutely begged me to do it, I wouldn't mind being his photo subject in my work clothes, but...`
` Ahh, but it's so embarrassing!`
` But if he insisted, then`
` eeeeeeek?!`
`Did you hear all that?!"`
`"No, I didn't hear anything."`
`"Wh-What is it?`
` Did you need something?`
` If it's about Jirou-san, I don't want to hear it."`
`"...Who are you mad at?`
` Is it Rena?`
` Or is it Tomitake-san...?"`
`"It's not your fault, Rena-chan.`
` I was just feeling fed up with that weak-willed idiot."`
`"I thought so.`
` Rena was fed up too.`
` He got to spend all that time with a charming woman like you, and he got distracted by another girl? He's the worst. `
`...How miserable he must be, to not notice how attractive you are, Takano-san."`
`"I... I know, right?`
` Ho ho ho ho!`
`Wait, you were the one who got between us in the first place.`
` Besides, what happened to Jirou-san?`
` Why did you come after me?"`
`"Hau.`
` I don't care about Tomitake-san, really.`
` And also, Rena...`
` well, to tell the truth...`
` umm........."`
`"Hm?`
` What is it?`
` Could you say it a little louder?"`
`"The one Rena actually loves is you, Miyo-san!!"`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaat?!`
` Wait, ho, ho ho ho ho ho!`
` It's not nice to tease adults, Rena-chan..."`
`"What is an adult, really?`
` Am I not allowed to love someone because I'm not an adult?`
` I thought loving someone was how you became an adult...?"`
`"Uh,`
` umm...`
` ho ho ho ho ho ho...!`
` Hey, don't cling to me...!`
` Is this one of your punishment games?!"`
`"Nothing of the sort!!`
` Rena has always had eyes only for you, Miyo-san!`
`Ahhhhh, I want to call you my big sister, Miyo-san!`
` I want to be your little sister!!`
`I want to greet you every morning and tell you your tie is crooked and fix it for youuuu!!"`
`"Y-You know, people make this mistake sometimes, but I don't actually swing that way at all..."`
`"That's a lie!!!"`
`"Rena understands!!`
` I see the dirty looks you give to men!`
` It might look like you and Tomitake-san are in a relationship, but in reality, you're even lying to yourself! `
`It's only so that you can fool yourself into thinking you can have a normal love!!`
`I know it eats away at you, too, Miyo-san!!`
` Men are nothing but beasts! `
`There's no way a person and a beast could ever understand one another.`
` But... I'm sure Rena and Miyo-san can!!`
`I want to discover the darkest secrets of Onigafuchi Village with you, Miyo-san.`
` I want to do a real watanagashi with you...`
` and cut open stomachs and pull out people's insides... with you...`
` With you..."`
`By the time we arrived, Rena was in the middle of an incredible attempt at seduction.`
`Did she think this was a joke?!`
` "Your liver is so kyute, Rika-chan, I want to take it home"? You call that a joke?!`
`"Ahh, ahahahahaha!`
` Sorry about this, Miyo-san!`
` It looks like spring has come in Rena's head, and, well~"`
`"...Spring?`
` What do you mean by spring?"`
`"Well, umm, ahaha!`
` Everything Rena's blurting out right now has nothing to do with what she actually wants, and..."`
`"Silence,`
` you dirty ape.`
`Ahhhhh, Rena-chan!`
` It took until now to realize it.`
` You're right, you're completely right!`
` Thanks to you, I finally realized what I was missing by being with Jirou-san!"`
`"Hau, Miyo-san..."`
`"Hey, hey, no hugging allowed!!`
`Bughybgbrbhhr?!"`
`"...Rena didn't even show mercy to Satoko!"`
`"Hau~ Rena won't forgive anyone who tries to tear her away from her true love, even if it's Satoko-chan~!"`
`"Geez... It's even worse than with Mr. Tomitake, since this one's accepting it!"`
`"Thank you, Rena-chan!`
` I feel like I could stay with you forever!`
` Now, let's go bring about Oyashiro-sama's curse—together! `
`And then we'll line up at the table of the gods and hold each other tight for all eternity!!"`
`"Aaahhn, Miyo-saaan!`
` Umm, is it all right if I call you my big sister from now on...?"`
`...Oh, great!!`
` At this rate, the Great Hinamizawa Disaster will happen tomorrow night!`
`The two of them will cut open my stomach and make a stew with my insides!!`
`"Hanyuu!`
` Takano definitely has the magatama, right?!"`
`"Y-Yes, she does!!"`
`"Mii, Keiichi, Satoko!`
` If we leave things be, it won't only be Rena's life on the line—something terrible could happen to the whole of Hinamizawa!! `
`We need to get the magatama away from Takano as quickly as we can!"`
`"Yes, we do!!`
` That key ring with the white seal you have—that's Rika's, okay?`
` Please return it to her!!"`
`"I don't want to.`
` Why should I have to give you something someone else gave me?`
` Still, this was Rika-chan's?"`
`Takano took the white magatama out of her pocket and stared at it, fascinated.`
`"Yes, it is!`
` Rika-chan says it's a precious treasure of the Furude Shrine!"`
`"Mion, you dumbass!`
` If you say that to her, she'll...!"`
`"What was that?`
` A precious treasure of the Furude Shrine...?`
` *giggle* *giggle* Ohh ho ho ho ho ho!!`
` Now that I know that, I won't be giving it back so easily!`
` Let's get going, Rena-chan! `
`It's time for a thorough investigation of this mystical jewel!`
` Ahh, what shape is it?`
` What weight, what size?!`
` Ahhn, maybe we'll see how it tastes, too!!"`
`"Oh no, it tastes terrible! Get her!!"`
`"Ohh ho ho ho ho ho ho!`
`No, no, I won't be giving it back~!"`
`"Hey, you! Wait right there!!!"`
`"Hau, not so fast! Rena won't let you chase Miyo-san!!"`
`Rena stuck out her arms and prevented us from following Takano!`
`...Ah, if anyone else had done that, they wouldn't have been much of an obstacle, but with Rena, it looked like it would be a pain.`
`...Actually, with Rena as she is now, I feel like even Akasaka with his armor-piercing bullets would be in trouble!`
`"C-Crap...!`
` Rena, move aside!!`
` We only want that magatama Takano-san ran off with!!"`
`"You can't have it.`
` Rena Ryuugu won't let a single soul get in the way of Miyo-san's research!!"`
`"Gah, if we move into close range, Rena will have way more reach and speed!`
`Which means we have to get her from outside her range!!`
` Sorry, Rena! Don't hate me for this!!"`
`Mion pulled something out—two handguns?!`
`No, they were those model handguns she always made a point of walking around with, despite not only never pulling them out but also them looking completely unusable. No more than a precaution!!`
`"Kids, never point a weapon at another person like I'm about to do!!`
` Take this—my Mion Bullet!!"`
`With splendid form, she showered Rena in a torrent of BBs!`
`Her shooting skills looked just like that certain style where just mastering the basics increases your combat ability by 120%!!`
`But Rena didn't move a single step. Instead, she swung her hands through the air and blocked all the BBs from a point-blank range!!`
`"Oh?`
` Mii-chan, was that your only trump card?"`
`Rena grinned, then pointed her palms out at us.`
`Then, moving her fingers like a magician playing with a ball, she twirled all the caught BBs between her fingers!`
`"I'm not very impressed with you shooting a model gun at someone's face. Not very impressed."`
`"...Urgh..."`
`"Huh?`
` What's the matter, Kei-chan? Does your stomach hurt?"`
`...Mion is just the best.`
`"Now it's Rena's turn to get going!! It's Rena's turn!`
` Something terrible will happen to anyone who gets in the way of Rena's romance~!!`
` Hau hau hau~!!"`
`"I-It's time for you to do something, Keiichi-san!`
` Do something to Rena-san with that silver tongue of yours and put an end to this!"`
`"Th-That's easier said than done!!`
` That's a secret art among secret arts, and not even I can just use it whenever! `
`It's so secret that ancient China feared it as an ultra-secret art that would end your own life if you used it—a final, ultimate secret art that martial artists risked their lives on!! `
`But despite me saying that, Hien has used it several times already, hasn't he?`
` He came up with the theory that it's like having multiple lives.`
`People will say you only have one life to live, but in Japanese culture, there are few ancient writings that understood the remaining lives system—just look at how we say that cats have nine lives.`
`In the first place, the lives system was a fundamental part of shooting games since times immemorial.`
` What?`
` All that is perfectly obvious, you say?`
` You're wrooooong!!`
`A true remaining lives system is when you get to replay from the last checkpoint before you died!`
`Coming back to life in the same place you died may look like a remaining lives system, but it's actually no different from a hit point system!`
`Who could have predicted that this obvious, important system in shooting games would ironically collapse in the genre's biggest hits?!`
`Take Grad**s, for example—established as the highest achievement in the shooting game world!! `
`When you die in that game, all your power-ups go back to zero, and you have to restart back at a predetermined respawn point. `
`During later stages of the game, you would die right when you respawned, over and over, rewinding to the exact same place, so it didn't matter how many lives you had left!`
` It's a trap!!`
`It's practically what invented the word 'trap'!`
`And its sequel, Sala****er, brought a novel new idea to the shooting game genre at the time:`
` respawning in the same place you died!`
`Now, even children could play, free from worry!`
` Anyone could brute force their way through the game, no matter what stage or boss they were on, as long as they had lives left and 50 yen for each continue!!`
`But it was at this point that the games stopped being sacred!`
` Enemies you couldn't beat, no matter how many times you tried...`
` And bosses...`
` and stages!!`
` And the exhilaration you feel at finally winning—that is what Higurashi is!`
`The excitement at breaking through the unbreakable fate of 1983...`
` It's much like the sense of exhilaration you get...`
` from clearing Tr**an after over two years of attempts!!`
`I ask you, is there any game in our time that whets your appetite for victory for such a long time as that?`
` No, there is not!`
` And why is that?`
` Because anyone can just brute force their way through the game and see the ending!!`
`No matter how recklessly you play through a game, once you beat it, it loses its charm.`
` And weak players will get tired of the game without ever having truly played it!`
` In the end, it was none other than those weak gamers who brought forth this age of weakness!!`
` Ko**mi acknowledged this mistake!`
`As proof, the actual sequels in the Gra**us series abandoned their respawn system and brought back their trap system!!`
`Well, actually, for Touhou, it's fine to respawn on the spot.`
` I mean, if we had to go back to the beginning of the stage every time we died to Royal Flare,`
` when the heck would I be able to see the little sister?!`
`I've still never gotten to see the last boss of EoSD or PCB's extra stage with my own skills!!`
` Please, I'm begging you, Z*N-san, give us continues in the extra stage too,`
` so I can brute force my way through because I really want to see the little sister and Yukarin!!`
`And why is it that the extra stages are such a cakewalk for literally everyone else in the world?!`
` What am I missing? Love? The ability to see moving objects? Libido?!`
`Ahh, at this point, I want to write a sound novel about a love triangle between the 'shoot and I'll move' girl and the doll-using girl and the anemic witch girl for the next Touhou-only event!`
` Ending it in tragedy, of course, lol tee-hee!`
` What do you think of that, Yatazakura-san, BT-saaaan!!!"`
`"Hau...`
` Rena has absolutely no idea what you're saying."`
`"Well, that's good...`
` I had no clue either..."`
`"Really?`
` I knew what he was talking about.`
` I mean, I had the skill to see Mokou-chan!`
` The Returning Bridge was a close call, though!"`
`...Oh, boy, what a haphazard ability...`
` And it actually stopped Rena dead in her tracks, too.`
` If you want to kill Keiichi, I guess you have to do it all at once. `
`If you foolishly ask if he has any last words, there's no telling what would happen.`
` ...Ah, I get it.`
` Takano was right to kill him with a single bullet in Minagoroshi, wasn't she? `
`If he'd gotten to say something at the end like the others, it would have really softened the blow of that tragic scene...`
`"...Wait, Rika.`
` He stopped Rena, but it doesn't matter if nobody is going after Takano."`
`"Wait, huh?!`
` Were we all entranced by those fantastic words?!`
` Stupid, stupid! What the heck are we doing?!"`
`"O-Oh no!`
` Takano-san is gone!`
` We lost sight of her!!"`
`"Wait, Kei-chan, according to one of Z*N-san's readme files, there's a part where he says that bombs are basically the same as remaining lives."`
`"No, those are just the modern shmup bombs that immediately make you invincible when you press the button!`
`When bombs first appeared in Tig*r H*li, it took almost a second for one to go off when you activated them."`
`"Rena doesn't really get it, but the fairies that drop items for you when you use a continue are really kyuute, kyuute!"`
`"I have absolutely no idea what any of you are talking about."`
`......I'm sorry, Satoko.`
` I'm able to keep up with them.`
` Raid*n is nostalgic, too.`
` Ah, I get it. We started with Hien and ended with Raid*n.`
` ...Meaning we left quite a lot behind.`
`"No, wait!`
` Takano, Takano!`
` None of that matters. We have to go after Takano!!"`
`"O-Oh, that's right!!`
` We have to get the magatama back!"`
`"Keiichi-san, you engage Rena-san in some more strange conversation for us!!`
` We're going!!"`
`"Is that so?`
` Have a nice time.`
` I wonder if something happened?`
` Hau."`
`"Hmm?`
` Wait, Rena, do you not care about Takano-san anymore?!"`
`"...Huh?`
` What happened to Takano-san?`
` Hau."`
`Rena looked at us blankly.`
`...As far as I could tell from her expression, she didn't really understand what she was doing here.`
`...Could that have meant Takano didn't have the magatama anymore?`
`"I-It's highly possible.`
` If Rena went back to normal, then the white magatama would no longer have an owner."`
`"...In the worst case, it's okay if nobody finds it, right?`
` There's no problem as long as nobody picks it up."`
`"We can't do that!`
` If an ant picks it up by mistake and brings it back to its hill, what will you do then?!"`
`"...There would be an ant farm at the Ryuugu residence the very next day."`
`Anyway, we have to catch Takano!`
` With her ill-natured disposition, she might have thrown it away somewhere!!`
`"...And now we have her.`
` You caused us far too much trouble."`
`"Ahh, geez!`
` I need to get ready to do some analyses with Rena-chan, so let me go~!!"`
`"Before that, return Rika's magatama!!`
` It's really important to her!"`
`...But judging by how Rena looked, Takano no longer had it.`
`"What's this...?`
` That's odd.`
` I could have sworn I put it in my pocket...?`
` How odd?"`
`"Whaaaat?!`
` Did you drop it somewhere?!"`
`I see... So that was the punch line...`
`After a lot of effort, we struggled to capture Takano.`
`She ran all around the village, making fun of us, and at the end of the manhunt, we tied her up.`
`...She must have dropped it while running around the village...`
`...Now we could only wait for someone to pick it up.`
`When that happened, Rena would react, and we would be able to figure out who it was.`
`...But when that happened, Rena would fiercely resist any attempts we made to restrain her...`
` This is truly, seriously a pain in the butt!!`
`"...The Magatama of Fuwarazu?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` We don't know how the one ended up flying into your mouth, but anyway, that's the kind of magic power they have."`
`"Then when someone picks up the white one, Rena falls in love with them, even if she doesn't mean it...?"`
`"That's the idea...`
` Your heart is literally lying around somewhere in the village."`
`"I-I don't want that...!`
` Hau...`
` The feeling of falling in love with someone should belong to me alone.`
`...If it doesn't, Rena's true feelings will...`
` Hau..."`
`"Ho ho, what's this?`
` Rena's true feelings?`
` Is there someone you like?`
` Why don't you tell this ol' man~?!"`
`"H-Hau~ I can't even tell you, Mii-chan!!"`
`"Gyphbghghphbhynn!!"`
`"M-Mion...`
` Try a little harder to understand a girl's heart...`
` Though it's weird for a man to say that."`
`"...If we find the white magatama, Rika-chan will do something about it, right...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So now we're desperate to find the white one before something terrible happens.`
` ...Though I think it's already caused a big uproar."`
`"...P-Please, Keiichi-kun.`
` Find the white magatama and save Rena...`
` I don't want someone else to have control over my feelings...`
` Uuuu..."`
`"R-Right!`
` I got it.`
` We'll save you, Rena!`
` ...So if the magatama's power takes hold of you again, please go easy on us...`
` Nobody can stop you when you're in kyute mode..."`
`"I-I can't...`
` It was like this with those two, but... My head got all filled with a fuzzy feeling... and I couldn't think about anything anymore...`
` So Rena doesn't think she'll have any mercy when it happens... `
`Before, when you all came, Rena wondered why you all got in her way.`
` I thought for sure you were going to tie me up, pour gasoline on me, and have a big explosive barbecue."`
`"...I-I see...`
` Anyone Rena is fond of will be helpful in a few ways.`
` ...Hahaha..."`
`"...Hau...`
` At this rate, I'll never be able to become a cute bride...`
` ...Hau..."`
`"Anyway, all we can do is keep searching.`
` ...For both Rena and the villagers, we have to settle this as soon as we can."`
`In the end, we could only go back along the route Takano had fled and look to see if it was lying anywhere.`
`But there was no way we could find a single jewel no bigger than the tip of your thumb.`
`When it started to get dark, everyone grew tired, and we started thinking about the more passive approach of waiting until Rena reacted to something...`
`"...E-Everyone, I'm sorry...`
` Rena's causing you so much trouble..."`
`"It isn't your fault.`
` You were just unlucky.`
` I'm sure we'll fix this together!"`
`"Okay..."`
`"It's late, though, so let's call it quits for today.`
` ...Rika-chan, could you read the scroll again to see if there's any better way to do this?"`
`"......I will.`
` To take responsibility for causing this disturbance, I'll brave a super-spicy kimchi dish tonight."`
`"Au au au au au!!"`
`"...Who? How unrefined, to flail around like that!"`
`We decided to call off the search for the day.`
`I could only hope somebody normal picked it up...`
