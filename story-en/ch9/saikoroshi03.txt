`When I tried using the crystal ball with Yamamoto today, it still hadn't recovered enough for him to talk to Hanyuu.`
`Only half a day had passed... but maybe if I went to the storehouse... I'd get through.`
`Hanyuu once told me the old air from the past had remained in the storehouse, and that she felt comfortable there.`
`Maybe that meant... the storehouse was filled with Hanyuu's power.`
`In other words, while the crystal ball didn't have quite enough power, maybe being in the storehouse would help a little.`
` Late that night, I slipped out of bed and snuck into the storehouse.`
`I wanted nothing more than to talk to Hanyuu.`
`I went to the altar before the holy vessel and spoke into the crystal ball...`
`"...Can you hear me...?`
` Hanyuu..."`
`The light in the ball was feeble.`
` ...But its otherworldly glow was clearly present.`
`Please, let her hear me...`
`My wish was granted, and a quiet voice, so low it might disappear at any moment, spoke in answer.`
`"......I can hear you, Rika..."`
`"Hanyuu, thank goodness, listen!!`
` I...`
` I......`
` uuuuuuu!!`
` I don't know what to do!`
` I don't know!`
` Uuuu!!"`
`This wasn't the time for crying.`
` ...I needed to tell her everything I discovered and ask Hanyuu's opinion.`
`I quashed my frantic emotions... and told her the Fragment was in my mother.`
`Hanyuu stayed quiet for a few moments.`
`...She knew, of course... that I'd have to kill my mother to return the Fragment to the world of the gods.`
`"...It makes sense, doesn't it?`
` You can only appear to Oyashiro-sama's reincarnation.`
` ...I'm not the eighth in this world, so you can't appear to me.`
` ...The ninth isn't good enough, huh?"`
`"It was a very long time ago.`
` ...Ancient times. So ancient even I've mostly forgotten."`
`It happened back when Hanyuu was still living in Hinamizawa.`
`Before Hanyuu became Oyashiro-sama...`
`It was how it all began, which Hanyuu never told me about no matter how much I asked her.`
`"I...`
` ......my human self, that is...`
` When I decided I would become a god...`
` My daughter...`
` Your ancestor, Rika, was very sad about that. `
`She knew I'd made the decision... because I'd lost hope in the human world."`
`I took all the sins of the human world upon me.`
`For there was no other way to cleanse those sins other than to destroy the sinners themselves.`
`People were forcing their sins on each other. An ugly existence.`
`Their excessive cruelty caused me to lose hope in this world.`
`I undertook all the sins of the human world, and cleansed them by letting them kill me.`
`I entrusted that final duty to my own daughter.`
`I thought that unless I gave her that role, she would one day be despised as the daughter of a demon god, and lose all hope in the human world herself.`
`My daughter didn't like that role, but she understood the weight of her mission, and in the end, she went through with it.`
`But she said something to me.`
`That she would change the human world, in which only the price of life could purify its sins.`
`Humans would combine their strength and help each other, cooperating with mutual benefit in mind.`
`She swore to me that she would create this utopia, which her mother had only dreamed of.`
`Please, Mother, do not lose hope in the world of man.`
` I swear that I shall heal that sadness...`
`But I would become a god.`
` I couldn't accept my daughter's feelings...`
`......No, actually, that wasn't it.`
`...I had already lost hope in the corrupted world of man, and I just didn't want to look at it anymore.`
`But... my daughter made a firm promise that she would remake that world into something better...`
`Then I shall believe in what you feel.`
`When in this land people live happily, aid one another, support one another, and think as one, I shall return to this land once more.`
`My daughter killed me and took control of the village, the divine power of the demon god dwelling within her.`
`She became their leader, and created doctrines so that everyone would trust in and help one another.`
`By making them to fear a curse where discordant hearts would revive the specter of the demon god.`
`She led them strictly, not letting my purification go to waste, so that those purified sins would never again revisit the village.`
`And so the village did regain a temporary peace, but I never descended to them again.`
`.......I had rejected the human world much too strongly.`
`But no matter how strong the power to reject, it can never last forever.`
`Whether hearts, or walls, or lids or doors...`
` there is nothing that time will not decay.`
`Even the power shutting me away from the human world wouldn't last forever.`
`...My daughter would learn the limits of that power through a revelation from a higher god than me.`
`It was said that when eight generations of Furude bore a girl as their first child, I would come again.`
`The miracle of eight consecutive firstborn girls would be the key that broke my power of rejection.`
`My daughter left that legend to the Furude family, and it passed down to her descendants, so that this land would continue becoming my ideal...`
`"...So, Rika.`
` When you were born as the eighth girl in a row.`
` ...I was connected to the human world again.`
` ......Long ago, I may have hated and shunned the human world. `
`But a millennium without contact was more than enough time to heal my sadness. `
`...At some point, I actually started to feel sad at the prospect of living in a world where I was all alone.`
` I had intended to spend those thousand years in rejection... but it was also a punishment for me. `
`I... realized how shallow my feelings had been when I hated and despaired over the human world.`
` ...And before I realized it, the Furude family started giving birth to consecutive girls.`
` ...When your mother was pregnant, I wished so, so much for it to be a girl..."`
`"...I'm sure.`
` I mean, the first face I remember seeing wasn't my mother's—it was yours."`
`"Maybe abandoning the human world for a thousand years was my punishment.`
` Humans can only live in the human world.`
` And they must live earnestly in the world they are born into. `
`...For someone who made light of that and tried to abandon the world so easily, maybe an exile of a thousand years is a fitting punishment."`
`......Hanyuu's words were heavy.`
`Maybe, having been carefree in our walk between countless worlds, even comparing our own lives to dice rolls... we had been sinful.`
`"...I lived with you, my friend and daughter of one thousand years ago.`
` ...And when we came to the dead end of 1983......... I committed another sin.`
` I used my power to change your fate."`
`"......Are you saying...`
` that in the very first world...`
` you should have accepted the fate of Takano cutting me open and killing me...?"`
`"......It may sound cruel to you, Rika, but that is how I feel right now.`
` I made light of the world I lived in.`
` And I made light of the world you lived in, too. `
`I should have lived in earnest in the world where we were together. I should have welcomed it, no matter its end."`
`"Stop that.`
` Wallowing in masochism might make you feel better, but it makes me unhappy.`
` ...I said I didn't want to surrender to that fate...`
` and that I'd fight on forever to achieve a much more wonderful life... `
`and made this hundred-year journey with you.`
` We're at the end—it's absurd to come out with that now!`
` You're just being sentimental! `
`Aren't you just making light of this world, too, which you and I built together over a hundred years?`
` Don't you think that's selfish?!"`
`"...It is man's sin to save a dying animal, then bask in rapture.`
` We go up the snowy mountain, kill the beasts, and offer their numbers to the gods."`
`"After all this, you're saying it was my fate to die, too?!`
` You've gone insane!!`
` I don't care what you say—the world we won is a result of our sweat and tears! `
`You and I are the only ones who can understand how brilliantly it shines!`
` And now you're rejecting it?!"`
`"...Rika, please let me get back on topic.`
` ...Once I had my fill of this world with you, the eighth, I planned to disappear at the end of your life. `
`It had nothing to do with the time you'd be alive for, so I never told you.`
` But in that world, your mother is the eighth.`
` ...That means I've already had contact with the world of man...`
` was satisfied with how wonderful Hinamizawa had become, and have already left for a higher plane. `
`...In that world, I've already left.`
` That's why I can't appear there."`
`"But there's a Fragment of your world there.`
` And it's in my mother.`
` Which means this.`
` Only my mother knows that she is the eighth.`
` If I kill her, the contradictory force saying you can't appear here will vanish. `
`Correct?"`
`"That's right.`
` Originally, it was an obvious fact that your mother is the eighth in that world...`
` and killing her wouldn't necessarily change anything. `
`But after you drifted here from another world, Rika, it would be like mooring a boat to dock.`
` ...It was fortunate only your mother knew the truth. `
`If a lot of other people knew, you would have had to kill them all."`
`"........."`
`"I'm sure you wanted my opinion on whether you should kill your mother to return to the previous world or stay in this world."`
`"......I did."`
`"This whole time, I've been investigating what kind of world you're in.`
` ...And when I found out what it was... I expected this day would eventually come. `
`And I predicted you would grow indecisive and talk to me about it, and that you would want to choose a world based on the result of our discussion.`
` ...So I thought long and hard.`
` About how to guide you. `
`Unlike the world of gods, the words in the world of man are narrow.`
` ...No matter what words I choose, they will carry bias within them. `
`I thought very hard about what words to say so that you would truly choose for yourself.`
`...And I still am.`
` After all, you've left the answer in my hands.`
` ...If I suggested you should choose this world, you would choose it.`
` You would shift the responsibility of paying the price to me. `
`That would be cowardly, and there is no worth in a life resulting from such a decision. `
`...As someone who has trodden countless worlds and left her footprints outside the world of man, you must make a responsible choice.`
` Without relying on me.`
` With your own strength."`
`"......I know what you're trying to say.`
` ...You couldn't bear me shifting the blame...`
` and saying 'this happened because I did what you said.'`
` ...Decide your own life for yourself. Easy enough to understand."`
`"I wanted to tell you this, too.`
` ...I was happy, spending my life with you.`
` And through those countless worlds we walked together, I learned that Hinamizawa overflowed with kind and gentle cooperation. `
`It had everything I wanted from the world.`
` ...I wanted to say that even if you chose a world without me in it, and I was to disappear, I would still be happy."`
`".........Hanyuu..."`
`Hanyuu had foreseen this.`
`...Foreseen that this world would grow ever warmer for me.`
`But Hanyuu herself was in opposition to this world.`
`...Any amount of discussing this with Hanyuu, who was from the previous world... would only make it more difficult to forsake that one.`
`She had even anticipated that after discussing it with her, I would need to make a decision from an impartial viewpoint.`
`That's why she said it.`
`She wanted to accept whatever fate Rika Furude's decision gave her.`
`She didn't want me to worry about her, and live in the world that I liked the best...`
`"...Let's say I did choose this world.`
` ...What would happen to you?"`
`"Because of that world's rules, our long journey together would come to an end.`
` ...For you, a life in that world...`
` And for me, the fact that my time has already ended in that world would be applied."`
`"Doesn't that mean you would disappear?!"`
`"...But that's a really, really pleasant thing.`
` ...Rika, you seem to think of it as me dying.`
` ...And at first, I thought so too--that the me in that world would die. `
`...But the Hanyuu of that world... She may have disappeared, but she was filled with joy.`
` ...She spent her life with your mother, enjoying her time to the fullest. `
`Your mother is still alive, but that world's version of me is having a wonderful dream, enveloped in kindness, in a sleep from which she'll never awake. `
`...I'm sure that warmth, that comfort, is like that of a mother's womb.`
` ......Now that I know that...`
` I actually wonder if you will choose that world, for me..."`
`"......Are......`
` you serious...?"`
`"...If you had lived for one thousand years, Rika, you would understand that warmth..."`
`I could feel an ecstasy in Hanyuu's words...`
`...Hanyuu had lived for a millennium... and she understood that in a way I couldn't.`
`"You have to be joking. I'm just a kid. I'm only a hundred years old. Of course I can't understand."`
`".........Rika.`
` Would you please stop using me as a reason to run away from this choice?"`
`"............Mgh."`
`...That was the truth.`
`My old world and this one are being weighed on scales in my heart.`
`...It isn't tipping, even slightly, toward either side.`
`Trying to shift the responsibility for choosing onto Hanyuu was just me being irresponsible...`
`"I can tell you everything about that world's construction to help you make your choice.`
`First... Keiichi Maebara, who told us many times that destiny could be broken. `
`...He did not transfer schools in this world."`
`"I knew that for a while now.`
` He wasn't in my class."`
`"For a time, Keiichi suffered the stress of his entrance exams...`
` but, unlike in the previous world, he wasn't firing any toy guns at children. `
`He strengthened his mind, endured the temptation, and finally overcame his mental weakness.`
` ...Right now, he's trying to deal with the exams awaiting him as someone with a firm pride in his breast."`
`"......Which means Keiichi's sin is absent.`
` ...Which is why he never moved here."`
`"Rena Ryuugu, too, never moved to Ibaraki, since her parents' company stayed in business.`
` Therefore, the divorce didn't happen, either.`
` For that reason, Rena will feel no guilt."`
`Rena had no sin either.`
`"On the day of the ceremony where the elder sister had her back tattooed, Mion Sonozaki and Shion Sonozaki didn't switch places."`
`"...I see.`
` I got the feeling that the Mion at school seemed somehow different.`
` ......She always loved board games, but she talked about her little sister knowing more about them.`
` ...I see...`
` I get it."`
`"Mion didn't push her role as the successor onto her younger sister, and now spends her days training to be the head of her family. `
`Shion, too, attends a distant school so she can support the family without getting in the way, and she's working her hardest as we speak."`
`"...The sisters both felt guilty at switching on the day of the tattoo ceremony.`
` ...If that didn't happen, then..."`
`Mion and Shion had no sin.`
`"...I don't think I need to go on, but Satoko Houjou doesn't carry the sin of patricide.`
` Satoko grew closer with her stepfather, and they rebuilt their relationship. `
`Because of that, she wasn't possessed by that terrible illness."`
`"The Houjou family didn't oppose the village, and they weren't even ostracized.`
` ...Satoko has no sin.`
` Well... For Satoko and her family, this would be their ideal world."`
`For Satoko and her family...?`
`Wait, no...`
`Isn't this...`
` the ideal world for everybody...?`
`Keiichi came to Hinamizawa because he had committed a sin.`
`But in this world, he didn't, and was right now living his very best.`
`Rena avoided her sad fate, too, and never sinned.`
`She called herself by her given name, Reina, and was living happily.`
`Mion and Shion were leading happy lives, too.`
`...Without the tattoo incident, they were friendly sisters, the way they'd been born.`
`They were forced to live apart due to family matters, but that wouldn't be enough to tear them apart.`
`For Satoko, this world was exactly the world of her dreams.`
`Surrounded by the warmth of her family and big brother, she was leading a bright and healthy life.`
`...This is the world that I, as her friend, should be wishing for the most.`
`For Satoshi, well, this was the only world in which he still existed.`
`...In all the worlds I'd been to, this was the only one where he was alive.`
`Satoshi couldn't exist anywhere but here.`
`...And Rika Furude.`
`For Rika, this world was...`
` .........this world was...`
`Maybe I had zero friends.`
`Compared to my old world, that was very sad.`
`But I could change that now, through time and effort.`
`Maybe I was sad Keiichi wasn't here.`
`...But Keiichi was living a resolute life in the place he originally lived.`
`Instead, I had Satoshi.`
` He wasn't the same as Keiichi, but he was very kind and considerate...`
`Even the club I was disappointed didn't exist could start the very next day, if I wanted it to.`
`With the Houjou siblings, Mion, Rena, and me.`
` And maybe my other classmates, too?`
` What would the club be like with so many people...`
`I didn't think I'd be able to compare it to the fun we had with Keiichi and the rest.`
` I knew I wouldn't be able to place one over the other...`
`My parents were in this world.`
`And I'd already learned how to interact with them, as Rika Furude, who had regained the love of her family.`
`My parents weren't in the previous world.`
`...But I had lively roommates that wouldn't leave me feeling lonely.`
` Satoko.`
` ......And Hanyuu.`
`If I chose this world, I'd have to say good-bye...`
` to Hanyuu, the friend I'd spent a hundred years with.`
`Friend...?`
`No.........`
` If what Hanyuu said was true...`
` then she was my ancestor, and a mother to me.`
`...Which meant she was on the exact same level as my father and mother.`
` She was my family.`
`My parents and Hanyuu were both very important to me.`
` ...I couldn't possibly weigh them against each other...`
`"......That world is the ideal world, born of someone's dream.`
` Nobody related to you has sinned.`
` It's a very, very pure, clear, and beautiful world. `
`I've already left that world, and Rika's life hasn't been corrupted.`
` ...So I have no sin, either.`
` And you, Rika.`
` You haven't corrupted your own life, so neither do you."`
`"Even Takano has no sin.`
` Not a single person does.`
` A perfectly white, blank world..."`
`"That's right.`
` And you can choose that now, Rika.`
` ......Maybe this world is a valuable opportunity given to you at the end of your century-long journey by the god of fate, who even I've never met."`
`"............They could have been a little more compassionate about it."`
`"Which is why that god gave you the chance to go back to your old world, too.`
` ...By committing the gravest sin of matricide...`
` you can choose to release yourself from this sinless paradise."`
`"...Hanyuu.`
` You said your daughter killed you.`
` ...What do you think of me repeating the act?"`
`"......If I were your mother, I would probably say this.`
` If it made you happy, I would not spare my own life.`
` ...It might be too early for you to understand, Rika. `
`But it's a feeling only someone who has given birth to a child and become a mother could know.`
` I was once a mother, so I understand. `
`...If you said going back to your old world would make you happy, your mother would gladly offer you her life."`
`"She couldn't...`
` She's the one person who wouldn't ever say that.`
` She'd just scream 'are you crazy?!' and go into hysterics..."`
`...But... Then I remembered my mother's smile when we made curry together.`
`Would it be so strange if...`
` such fearsome words came from her mouth......?`
`"I don't regret my daughter killing me.`
` Thanks to that, the sin she might have inherited was cleansed.`
` If I had spared my own life, my daughter might have been persecuted, same as me."`
`"...But have you ever thought about what the daughter who killed you felt...?"`
`"......"`
`"...It's easier to die, isn't it?`
` You can wallow in devotion and virtue as you die peacefully.`
` But the killer has to bear that cross forever.`
` ......Didn't you say so before? `
`Your daughter vowed to create a Hinamizawa where everyone wanted to help each other. All for your sake.`
` And your daughters, over a thousand years, went along with your sin.`
` ...Maybe you shouldn't have died. `
`I don't know what the sin you were bearing was, but you should have lived and fought.`
` Fought so that your descendants wouldn't have to bear the sin. `
`But you surrendered, and for a thousand years, your descendants have been bearing your cross.`
` ...Right?!"`
`"..............."`
`Hanyuu was silent.`
`...That, without a doubt, was Hanyuu's sin.`
`It was easy to die for her daughter's sake.`
`But her daughter's guilt would never heal.`
`But when Hanyuu answered, she remained undaunted.`
`"Then, let me ask you, Rika.`
` ...You, who say I should have lived and fought.`
` What will you do now, in that world? `
`...Do you wish to live in that world, accepting the reality you are in, and always fighting the oddities different from your old world? `
`Will you abandon that world that you gained after a hundred years, stained in grime and sweat, and yet still beautiful?!"`
`"..............."`
`She was right—maybe this world was beautiful...`
`But that didn't mean the way my old world shone wasn't beautiful too.`
`Why wouldn't it be? We'd won that fate after such a long journey...`
`"And even now, you call that world, which you gained at the end of a century, your original world.`
` ...So however pleasant this world may be...`
` shouldn't you throw it all away...`
` fight away the desire to stay in this world, and return to your original one?`
`Even if you had to destroy this world, liberated from the sins of all related to you?!"`
`".........Urgh......"`
`...My daughter, who tells me to fight.`
`You, too, should fight.`
`To fight is not to defeat and overcome the obstacles before you.`
`In the end, that is no more than a simple detour on the straight path before you.`
`To truly fight is to make your own choices.`
`At every choice in life, at every crossroads...`
` people hesitate.`
`Having one choice brightly illuminated and then selecting it—such a predetermined choice is not a fight.`
`When no matter how many times you are presented with the choice, you choose the same one, it's inevitability.`
`A real choice is when you truly think and worry. When you never know which you should choose.`
`It is precisely the same as the choice between the red box and blue box you spoke of once before.`
`Will you choose the red box or the blue?`
`To choose without guidance demands incredible courage and determination.`
`That is a true choice.`
`If you knew what was in the boxes, it would no longer be a choice.`
`It is because you do not know what is inside that you can be satisfied with what is in the box you choose.`
`If you knew the contents of the other, it could lead to despair.`
`Being left at a crossroads, with no guidance and no hints, is what it means to live.`
`You may lazily continue to choose the right, or knock over the sign and choose at random. `
`You may also search carefully for hints, worrying over how beneficial the left or right would be, and remain at the crossroads forever...`
`Thus, you would be able to accept the final result awaiting you as your own responsibility, would you not?`
`You would not grow old and go into your coffin wanting advice from your parents, would you...?`
`Worry.`
` Choose.`
` And go forward.`
`That is the fight.`
`I earnestly worried, and chose my own life.`
`My daughters earnestly worried, and chose their own lives.`
`For each and every one of us, that is sacred. It is precious.`
`The descendant one thousand years later must not sully that.`
`All who lived in that age were always beautiful.`
`You must not speak of their lives using the values of later generations.`
`".................."`
`"Lastly, I'll tell you something very important.`
` ...The Kamu-no-Mikoto-no-Ri's power that connects us will soon be lost forever.`
` I will never again be able to interfere with that world."`
`"...So this is the last night I'll be able to hear one of these helpful lectures."`
`"There is one more thing.`
` The Fragment that has appeared in your mother will lose its power forever when the sun sets tomorrow.`
` 'Losing' doesn't mean 'disappearing'. `
`It means you will forever lose the chance to take back that Fragment with your own hands."`
`"Which means...`
` I need to make my decision about whether to go back to my original world by sundown tomorrow...`
` There's no third option to put the choice off..."`
`"No.`
` You may also choose to flee the decision, purposely ignore the last moment you have to choose, and passively stay in that world. `
`...If you did, would you live that life differently than one you chose proactively?"`
`...Whether or not I chose proactively... was also whether or not I would accept this world.`
`...If I continued to live here without accepting it... I would drag along all the distress that "I" currently held, forever.`
`Compared to that, maybe it would be a lot better just to choose one or the other.`
`But... Even that wasn't easy...`
`Hanyuu had said that very distress itself was the battle...`
`"......Now, Rika.`
` ...Fight.`
` Your fight will last until sundown tomorrow.`
` But please, don't run away.`
` ...Because whichever world you decide on, I know that world will be a wonderful one. `
`...Just like the world you gained after fighting for a hundred years was.`
` The world you choose after fighting through this will become wonderful, I'm sure of it. `
`...So please, Rika, you mustn't choose one without fighting.`
` People are never, ever satisfied with the result of a choice they didn't struggle with."`
`"...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...Thank you,`
` Hanyuu.`
` I'll......`
` I'll fight.`
` ...With...`
` this choice.`
` ...If I can meet you again, it will be in our original world.`
` .........And if...`
` it's this world...`
` then take a good rest, to heal your millennium of exhaustion. `
`.........Thank you for everything.`
` Thank you so much.`
` ...It was because of your strength...`
` that I...`
` mistook my own life for something I could do over as many times as I wanted.`
` ...If that's who I am...`
` then I feel like it would be strange, somehow, if I was living in my original world. `
`...It was easy for me to think that if I slipped up in any small way, I could just do it over.`
` But that...`
` wouldn't make that world a wonderful one...`
`......In that sense, I understand, just a little, your sin of using your power on me when you shouldn't have.`
` ...But that sin belongs to me, too, for walking through such an easy life. `
`As we traveled all those worlds, I called it 'rerolling the dice', treating my own life without respect.`
`...I think...`
` that this world taught me the weight of that decision.`
` ......So at the end...`
` being able to choose a wonderful world either way...`
` means I really am lucky, right? `
`...I have no doubt that I'm the most fortunate person in all these worlds.`
` Thank you, Hanyuu.`
` Thank you for giving me your kind words until the very end...`
` when I was just stupid and conceited. `
`...I'll worry over this with everything I have.`
` I'll worry and worry and worry...`
` and grasp a really, really wonderful world.`
` ...So thank you...`
` Hanyuu.`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
`...Hanyuu......`
` Please.........`
` answer me... `
`...uuuuuuuuu..."`
`The crystal ball was now quiet and cold in my hands...`
` and gave off only a dull reflection of the flashlight that illuminated me...`
`I shed all the tears I could.`
`I thought if I didn't... I would hesitate when it came time to choose.`
`So I cried out everything I had.`
` And I thanked her for our hundred-year relationship.`
` ...Because, depending on my choice, I might never get to say those words again.`
`Then, I replaced the crystal ball on the altar, where it was now just a marble, slipped out of the storehouse, and crawled back into bed.`
`...There was no way I was going to sleep.`
`At least, that was what I thought, until I wrapped myself in linens, felt the cool wind on my bare feet, and drifted off to sleep without realizing it......`
`Rika Furude`
` was going to sleep...`
`"I"...`
` was going to sleep...`
`Good night...`
` ...`
`...`
`eve`
`ry`
`one`
`.`
`Go`
`od`
` nig`

` ...`
`...`
`"`
`me`
`.`
`"`
`And the sun rose again on another wonderful day for Rika Furude.`
`...She took her first step, her first small effort, to become friends with her classmates again.`
`And at home, she was wrapped in her parents' love.`
`...And...`
` the sun brightening her wonderful day...`
` fell behind the mountains...`
` ......and disappeared...`
