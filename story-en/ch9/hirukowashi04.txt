`According to Hanyuu, the Magatama of Fuwarazu wouldn't take effect until after a short period of time.`
`By the time we peeled Rena away from Ooishi and took her out of the mahjong parlor, she'd suddenly gone back to her normal self.`
`But we couldn't waste time, because if we did that, she'd start getting cozy with Keiichi.`
`We got on our bikes and rushed to the shrine.`
`"Man, this is really taking a while.`
` It was just about dinnertime, and now this ol' man is starving."`
`"But it's good that we settled everything safely!`
` Though it may be rude to Rena of me to say, today was rather fun!"`
`"Fun or not, we got a glimpse of how terrifying Rena really is!`
` Can't say I'm totally satisfied with the ending, though."`
`"Why not?`
` Did we not resolve things safely and smoothly?`
` You're being a bit odd, Mion-san."`
`For some reason Mion didn't seem to be very amused seeing Rena and Keiichi riding side by side.`
` ...It was funny to me, so I let it slide.`
`"...All right. Rena, Keiichi...`
` Once you clean your hands, you two have to pray.`
` And keep praying until I say it's okay."`
`"Got it.`
` Come on, Rena, let's get this over with and settle things!`
` If we waste time, that weird power will start affecting you again!"`
`"Y-Yeah...`
` ......Hau... Little by little, well...`
` I think I feel it coming on..."`
`"Hey, Rika-chan, this is bad! Please hurry!"`
`"...I am hurrying, so you focus your mind on prayer."`
`"A-All right... Mmmgh..."`
`"......Hey, Keiichi-kun."`
`"What?"`
`"Back there, when you... um, saved me. Thanks."`
`"Do I look like I'd abandon a friend?`
` There's no need to thank me."`
`"...Okay.`
` ...The things you said to me back then, well, I was kind of happy... Kind of.`
` ...When you said you'd rescue me.`
` That by itself... Even though my mind was all fuzzy... I heard it loud and clear. `
`...It made me happy."`
`"I-I didn't mean anything special by it.`
` Well, uh, it just seemed like the right thing to say at the time, and I mean, it's pretty cliche!"`
`"......Keiichi-kun, you want to get the magatama out of your stomach as soon as you can, right...?"`
`"That's a dumb question.`
` I don't want to have some weird thing stuck in there forever."`
`"...R...Right.`
` ...It would bother you if, well... someone like Rena started clinging to you..."`
`"H-Hey.`
` Don't get me wrong, here...!`
` I'm not in a rush because I hate you or anything.`
` ...I mean, when the power starts up again, you'll, uh, start clinging to me, right? `
`I mean, I'm, uh, a man too, so I wouldn't hate that, but...`
` Your emotions being toyed with... I don't think that's fair.`
` ...Because that's not how you really feel, right? `
`That love you have is for the person you actually fall in love with. It's unfair to them if you let this weirdo mystical power direct it at me."`
`"...Yeah, you're right.`
` ......Oh, but, Keiichi-kun.`
` Back when we were playing mahjong, did you hear the others talk about how amazing it is that I match myself to my partner?"`
`"...Well, I guess."`
`"This isn't just me being humble, but... everyone can put in the work to get someone they fall in love with to like them back, if they want.`
` It's not a special power Rena has. `
`...If the person you liked said they liked homemade cookies, Rena isn't the only one who would want to do her best to make some.`
` Mii-chan and Satoko-chan and Rika-chan all would. `
`And of course you have that power too, Keiichi-kun."`
`"Is that how it works?`
` I guess I can relate to liking your homemade cookies, though, Rena. I really thought they were delicious when I ate them yesterday!"`
`"Th-Thanks.`
` ......And Rena doesn't always match herself to her partner, either.`
` Sometimes, when she tries to pull them into her own world, she drags them in without thinking of the bother she's being..."`
`"Aha ha, you mean with the treasure hunting?`
` Well, at first I was pretty confused about that!`
` I was surprised when I first learned a normal girl had a hobby like that, but it ended up being a good memory for me."`
`"...Yeah, it makes sense that it confused you.`
` Because it's weird...`
` Rena shouldn't bother inviting you out for that..."`
`"If the other person doesn't seem like they'll enjoy it, it's probably better not to force them to come, yeah.`
` There are a lot of guys out there who are too soft to say anything."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...You're right."`
`"But don't get me wrong!`
` I've always thought it was fun!`
` After all, I promised that if tomorrow's club ends early, I'll go treasure hunting with you again."`
`"Y-Yeah.`
` You did.`
` Yeah..."`
`"Well, I'll stick with you until you find someone you truly want to bring on a treasure hunt.`
` So don't worry, and leave the manual labor to me!`
` But I don't think I'd be able to move a refrigerator by myself.`
` Aha ha ha ha."`
`"Hau... Oh no...`
` Keiichi-kun... The Magatama of Fuwarazu... its power is coming up again..."`
`"Ah, crap, that's not good!`
` Just focus on praying for now!`
` Those feelings will go away in a few moments, so hold tight!"`
`"...You're right.`
` They'll disappear soon."`
`"Sheesh, I can't believe a god made such an annoying treasure!`
` He should think about the trouble he's causing."`
`"...M...Maybe.`
` ...Rena, well... I think it was a wonderful treasure...`
` Some people really like someone. They really love them... and need something to give them a little push. `
`...I'm sure there have always been lots of people like that.`
` ...This magic treasure gave people like that a lot of happiness, I think."`
`"Hmm.`
` Well, you're the biggest victim of all this, so I guess I can agree."`
`"Ah... umm......... Hauu... no... no more..."`
`"Hey, Rika-chan, again?! Hurry!!"`
`"......I am hurrying. I'm going as fast as I can!"`
`"...Ke... Keiichi-kun, this... umm, it might not be how I really feel...`
` It might be the magatama's power, okay...?`
` W-Well, Rena Ryuugu...... She really... really loves you, Keiichi-kun. `
`...I just wanted to tell you that... since the magic is going away soon..."`
`".....................St... Stupid.`
` ...Don't let that power get the better of you...`
` ...You want to be true to yourself, right?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I hope the magatama's magic... goes away soon..."`
`Because if it doesn't, then...`
` no matter how brave my words are...`
` they wouldn't tell you anything...`
`"...A-Au au au!`
` Did you hear that, Rika!`
` Rena just confessed to Keiichi, au au au!!"`
`"......Yeah, I heard just fine.`
` I don't give a damn about Keiichi, but this ticks me off for some reason.`
` Maybe I'll make them bunny hop up and down the shrine stairs and tell them it's part of the ritual."`
`It was a good thing Mion and Satoko couldn't hear that.`
`...If they had, they'd probably drop Keiichi into a hundred-game-long losing streak of punishment games.`
`...Ahh, should I tell them about it right now?`
` That would feel perfectly refreshing.`
` And also, Akasaka, if you were here, why didn't you come to my place and say hello instead of being so absorbed with your mahjong! `
`Maybe I'll go tell on him to his wife in Tokyo, and make a few things up along the way.`
` Grrr.`
`And yet, with the kind of day today was, there was one certain idiot wearing a refreshed smile, as though something good had happened!`
`"Onigafuchi Village... was always a very small world.`
` ...They needed something wonderful to happen once in a while.`
` ...That was why I granted them the Magatama of Fuwarazu."`
`"Look, I know you're trying to wrap everything up now.`
` But you're going to start stalking this newborn couple with that dumb smirk, aren't you?"`
`"Th-That's a mean way to say it!`
` If you've forgotten, I'm a god! That was very disrespectful!`
` Au au au!!"`
`"If I apologized for being disrespectful...`
` I'd have to make a few offerings to put you back in a good mood, right?!`
` Those cream puffs I had Akasaka bring back? Oh, how strange! `
`I've got powered-up kimchi cream puffs, a red-hot spiciness the likes of which this country has never tasted before, coming your way.`
` Maybe they'll go well with bok choy!"`
`"Those would go terribly together!!!`
` Kimchi is for the grilled meat store. Cream puffs are for my refined and elegant breaks!!`
` It's the same with toilet cleaners.`
` Don't mix them! It's dangerous!!"`
`"...H-Hey, Rika-chan.`
` How long do we have to do this?"`
`"Oh, I'm sorry.`
` The ritual is over now, so you're all good now, nipah~â˜†`
` I'm starving from using up all my power, so I'll have to eat a big plate of kimchi as soon as possible!!"`
`Au au au au au auuu!!!`
` Bang, slam,`
` bang, slam!!`
`Anyway, well, we had a half-baked ending, but everything worked out peacefully.`
`...For that night, anyway.`
`"H-Hau~!!`
` Chie-sensei, help meeeee! It's a molester~~!!"`
`"That's cruel, Rena-chan!`
` You promised me yesterday!`
` Look, I got you a nurse outfit in your size!`
` Let's have a private photoshoot, just you and me!!"`
`"Noooooo!!`
` You're sweaty, so let me goooo~!!"`
`"Hands off, Jirou-san. Rena-chan really doesn't want you doing that!!"`
`"No, you let go, Takano-san!`
`I finally found my soul mate and the greatest photo subject in the world!`
` I'm going to fill all my film with pictures of Rena in a nurse outfit!`
` Hau~ I'm taking you home with me~~!!!"`
`"Rena-chan doesn't have any interest in dirty apes like you!`
`Right, Rena-chan?`
` Starting today, you can call me...`
` o`
`-nee`
`-sama...`
` okay?`
`Oh no, your tie is crooked!"`
`"Nnnngh, both of you, let me go~!!`
` Why is this happening to me? Why?!`
` Uwaaaaahhn!!"`
`"...This isn't because of the magatama, so I can't do anything else.`
` To take responsibility, I'll only eat a mixture of kimchi, wasabi, and mustard for all three meals today."`
`"Au au au au au au au au...`
` Rika, you're a demon~`
` A savage~!!"`
`Then think about what you've done!`
`And once you're sorry, make a magic love item that's a bit more considerate and then give it to me.`
`...You better promise!`
