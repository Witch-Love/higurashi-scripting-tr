`"Keiichi~!`
` You have a phone call!"`
`"Huh?`
` During dinner?`
` I wonder who it is.`
` Could it be about Rena?!"`
`"It's from Rena-chan's father."`
`"...What?!`
` I've got a bad feeling about this!!`
` H-Hello?`
` Yes, good evening!"`
`"I apologize for calling this late.`
` Is Reina there?`
` She ran out of the house earlier this evening and hasn't come back."`
`"She ran out of the house?`
` Umm, how was she?"`
`"Well, she was in a headlong kind of run, like when she's playing a prank on someone.`
` I'd thought she was going to one of her friend's houses..."`
`"...That settles it.`
` Somebody picked up the white magatama!!"`
`"I'm very sorry for being late!!"`
`"...What's the situation?"`
`"We just got permission to go into Rena's room.`
` Judging by how she was acting at school, she must have left some clues in there."`
`"Yeah.`
` Come to think of it, I've never been in Rena's room before.`
` ...Makes me kind of nervous!"`
`"""Oh, wow..."""`
`"I had a feeling, but... This room is really something.`
` I can't tell whether it's a collection of trinkets or just a mess of junk!"`
`"...And yet she knows exactly where to find each and every one of her treasures."`
`"It's just as terrific as she is.`
` How did she fit all these things in here?`
` She must have been a dog in her past life!`
` I bet she liked collecting a lot of shoes and stuff."`
`"I always thought girl's rooms would be like... more tidy, more cute and bright and girly...`
` Maybe that's just a misconception that guys have. `
`I mean, Rena's room is like this, and Mion's room has comics laying around everywhere."`
`"Ahahahaha, well, this old man isn't a little girl, after all~"`
`"...Meep?`
` I think that was just Mii's manga room.`
` Keiichi, have you ever been in Mii's actual room?`
` Not in the main building, the one farther away—`
` mmff!!"`
`"R-Rika-chan, shhhh!!`
` Shhhh!!!"`
`"Ah, would you look at this!!`
` Look at all the books over here!!"`
`Satoko pointed over at Rena's desk.`
` A big pile of books, some open, sat on top of it.`
`"What kind of books is it this time?!`
` Hmm~?`
` Comic book volumes, maybe?`
` What's this...`
` 'Modern Washizu Mahjong'`
` 'Like the Crying Dragon'`
` 'Story of a Mahjong Wanderer.'`
` ...Wait, these are all books on mahjong!"`
`Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!`
`"...Well then, it's time for me to declare riichi.`
` I finally got a good tile."`
`"That's a lie!!!"`
`"Rena knows.`
` Akasaka-san, you've been pretending to build your hand since turn 5, but you're actually just discarding your draws.`
` You're switching the tiles in your hand to make it look like you're keeping them.`
`But why would you suddenly declare riichi now? Why now?!`
` Rena understands. `
`You could stay in tenpai without riichi, but you got a good tile to get rid of and make your discards look good, all for a trap? All for a trap?!"`
`"Nfu fu fu fu fu!!`
` Now this is a surprise!`
` Ryuugu-san, how in the world did you become such an incredible mahjong player?! `
`It's true—Akasaka-san's discards are nice and filled with pin tiles, and it even has a suji, making the 6-pin look like a safe tile, doesn't it?"`
`"...Heh heh. You're good.`
` That was a splendid read."`
`"That's a lie!!!"`
`"Why do you keep lying? Why?`
` You were lying just now.`
` This is a trap to get Ooishi-san to think you're waiting on the 6-pin!"`
`"Ho... ohhhhhhhhhh!`
` Is that true, Akasaka-san?!"`
`"...Gah...`
` You're good, Rena-chan.`
` Have you been playing mahjong long...?"`
`"No, not really. I just read a bunch of manga.`
` ...Because, well, hau.`
` I just wanted to play with Ooishi-san..."`
`Rena's cheeks flushed pink, and she snuggled up next to Ooishi's arm...`
`Ooishi grinned, not as dissatisfied as he'd like others to think, his upper lip pulling way up high in his excitement.`
`"Hmm, nfu~?!`
` Na, nah ha ha ha ha!`
` Well, what's going on now?!`
` Does this mean I finally have the charm of a dandy now that I've reached the end of my middle age?!"`
`"Oh, this is the tile you wanted, Ooishi-san.`
` Here you go~!`
` If you ron this, you'll get a mangan, and you can turn the tables on Akasaka-san, hau~!!"`
`"Would you look at that!`
` You even know the tile I needed!`
` Nfu fu~!`
` I've been blessed with a good partner tonight!"`
`"Guh... If I lose any more, I won't have enough money to pay for the Shinkansen fare back home...`
` ...I'm sorry, Yukie, but I can't back down here! Not now...!!"`
`"Hau~ What a kyute tile, I'm taking you home with me!!`
` Pon!`
` Chi!`
` And another kan!!`
` I'm taking all the sou tiles home with me!!"`
`"Ohh, Ryuugu-san, Akasaka-san is already in riichi!`
` Isn't it dangerous to reveal more dora?!"`
`"O-Ooishi, what a game!`
` The table is like a typhoon...!`
` Young lady, your hand is clear for all to see. I won't play into it...`
` Hm, this isn't a sou tile...`
` and with more dora on the table, I'll press my attack! `
`I'll call another kan as well!!"`
`"Hau, I'll ron off your kan!!`
` Chankan,`
` dora,`
` dora,`
` one red,`
` a mangan~!!"`
`"...Wha, wha, wha...`
` What kind of mahjong are you playing, young lady?!`
` A yaku-less hand?!"`
`"...W-Well, beginner's luck happens sometimes.`
` You have to be especially careful when playing against a beginner."`
`"Hau.`
` Well, that tile fell over when you were making your wall, Akasaka-san...`
` Mr. Investigator, you got a glimpse of it, didn't you?`
` You've been looking over at it all game, thinking about something..."`
`"Wh-Whaaat? You mean you predicted my kan and used it in a trap?!"`
`"Well, well! Nah ha ha ha!!`
` Wonderful!`
` Ryuugu-san, what talent you have!!`
` This is a surprise!!"`
`"Hau!`
` If Rena does even better, will you let her be your partner, Ooishi-san...?"`
`"Yes, yes, of course, yes!!`
` Come, come, let's keep the momentum going tonight!`
` This is the first time in my life I've had such a compatible tag-team partner!!"`
`"Guh... No, we can't show her mercy anymore!`
` We'll have to play for real, or we'll never beat her!"`
`"...Not even you can compete with her, Akasaka?"`
`"I can feel raw ambition, the kind that not even a lot of veteran players have!`
` ...This smell of gunpowder... There's no mistaking it.`
` This girl has a gift!`
`Ooishi-san, this has gotten interesting!!`
` I'll give it my aaaalllll!!"`
`"Bring it oooon!!`
` Ryuugu-san, let's take everything Akasaka-san's got!!`
` He'll be paying for our entire victory celebration tonight!!!"`
`"Hau~!!`
` We'll take him together~!!`
` And then we'll have a night celebration all by ourselves, hau~~!!!"`
`"...R-Rena is amazing...`
` She could do anything if it was for someone she liked..."`
`"The word 'impossible' isn't in her kyute mode's dictionary...`
` Even during club, none of us have as many ups and downs as she does."`
`"...You're right.`
` Her results after she's exploded and when she hasn't are strikingly different..."`
`"Anyway, we can let these people play their mahjong games.`
` ...More importantly, Hanyuu!`
` We have it this time, right?!"`
`"Au au!`
` There's no doubt—Ooishi is carrying it right now!"`
`"...Ooishi, we're sorry for interrupting you on the job.`
` Did you happen to pick up a white magatama in Hinamizawa, or rather, a white key ring with a seal on it?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Oh, yes, I believe I did.`
`I remember... I figured I'd bring it to the person managing lost property, but I forgot!`
` If I don't bring it there, that'd be misappropriation, you know."`
`"That belongs to Rika!`
` Please return it at once!!"`
`"That's right!`
` That magatama is the reason Rena's acting like this!`
` We'll turn her back to normal, so please give it back!"`
`"Ah, you idiot, what are you...?!"`
`"Whaaaaaaaat?!`
` I see, so that's how it was...`
` And here I thought I'd reached the peak of my middle age...`
`Then if I return this key ring to you all, Ryuugu-san will go back to normal?`
` Hrm, I'm not sure I like that! `
`I'll need Ryuugu-san's help to retake everything I've lost tonight!`
` So I'll be borrowing her for a little while longer!!"`
`"We can't let you do that!!`
` Rena asked us...`
` to save her!`
` And I promised to save Rena!`
` Give her back right now!!"`
`"Nfu fu fu fu~ What to do...`
` Well, just like how you all settle differences with your classroom club games, in this parlor we decide everything with mahjong.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`"That's right~ Nfu fu fu!!`
` If he gives that magatama back, Rena won't be able to be Ooishi-san's partner anymore...`
` Rena doesn't want that. She doesn't... Hau."`
`"It'll be fine~!!`
` When Ryuugu-san and I give it all we have, nobody can beat us! We're the greatest mahjong team that's ever lived!!"`
`"Hau~!!`
` Rena will be with you forever, Ooishi-san...`
` Hau~☆"`
`"Idiot!`
` That isn't how you really feel!!`
` The magatama is just making you lie to yourself!!`
` Do you remember what you said when you were sane?! `
`You said you didn't want someone else to have control over your feelings—you wanted us to save you!!`
` So Rena, I'll rescue you!!`
` Sorry, but can someone give me their seat?"`
`"Hrm, hmm.`
` I don't mind, but...`
` They've already cleaned me out."`
`"...I get it.`
` We can't let Ooishi-san get away with misappropriating someone's lost property.`
` I'll help you, Maebara-kun!"`
`"Ahahahahahahaha!`
` Keiichi-kun, I think you'll get stripped down to your underwear, cleaned out, and then thrown out of the parlor.`
` Just like when the Platypunks kicked out Torneko!"`
`"...You don't really mean that.`
` ...You actually asked us for help.`
` Rena, I'll be the one to rescue youuuuu!!!"`
`"Uh, right.`
` He won't rescue you,`
` we will!`
` That's important, so don't get it wrong!"`
`"...Mii needs to learn to read the mood, nipah~☆"`
`"Well, I don't favor the odds if Keiichi-san is by himself!`
` Let's all help him, as his staff advisors!!"`
`"Come, come!`
` We'll have a single east round with this seal key ring on the line!!"`
`"Let's raise the stakes.`
` We'll take back everything we lost today."`
`"...Well, Akasaka-san is finally baring his fangs, too...`
` Nfu fu fu!`
` Serious east round games like this are a lot more exciting than playing lazily all night long!"`
`"Then we have our match between Keiichi-kun plus the club members with Akasaka-san versus Rena and Ooishi-san's lovey-dovey puyo-puyo combo!!`
` Whoever gets first place wins for their team!"`
`"I get it. So even if I come in last, if my partner is first, we'll still win!"`
`"So even if Keiichi-san can't pull his own weight, Akasaka-san just has to get first place in his stead.`
` This is not all that disadvantageous!"`
`"Oh, but it is!`
` That just means the partner can deal into their ally's hand as much as they want!`
` The more in-sync they are, the more terrifying it is!`
`Rena's team has far more of an advantage with this rule!!"`
`"Maebara-kun, let's take it slow and steady.`
` Mahjong games are only lost when you get riled up and stop thinking!"`
`"Still, Akasaka-san...`
` You can't lose in mahjong when it's not heated, but you can only win when it is.`
` Nfu fu fu!`
` A team getting third and fourth despite never dealing in happens quite often!"`
`"......Those who don't really understand mahjong, myself included, would like an explanation.`
` What are the rules to this game, anyway?"`
`"Au au!`
` An east round game, also called a tonpuusen, is a short match that ends as soon as the dealership goes around once! `
`If the team with the first place player wins, then victory will be determined by how well the partners work together! `
`And since it's such a short match, Keiichi and Akasaka won't have any time to feel each other out!`
` Au au au!!"`
`"...Hey, can't you just go around behind them and tell us what tiles they have?"`
`"A-Au au au! That would be cheating!"`
`"You know, the Magatama of Fuwarazu you made are just as much of a cheating device!!`
` Just take responsibility and help us out!"`
`"Rika-chan, what are you muttering about?`
` Please be quiet. I'm trying to focus!!"`
`"...Keiichi.`
` I have a way to cheat and secretly look at their hands.`
` Now we can't possibly lose!"`
`"Ku ku ku!`
` When did you set that up?`
` If we know their tiles, we'll never lose!!"`
`"...Great.`
` This is a good flow. Maebara-kun, how are you doing?"`
`"Er, I've got no clue.`
` Maybe I should be backing you up..."`
`"I'm making a hon-itsu with man tiles.`
` Save up low-numbered man tiles, and wind tiles too, just to be sure."`
`"I get it. I'll collect the tiles you need, and then deal them in!`
` Got it!!"`
`"So this is a team match!`
` Once Akasaka-san knows the tile he needs is in Keiichi-san's hands, he can declare riichi, then get even more points with a sure-fire ippatsu!!"`
`"Which means Kei-chan has to be careful.`
` If the other team realizes which one is collecting tiles for the other, it'll be really bad. `
`He has to choose his discards carefully to make sure it looks like he's playing normally!`
` Otherwise, he'll make a mistake and deal into them, and it'll all be for nothing!!"`
`"It'll be fine!`
` We have Rika-chan reading their tiles!`
` I won't let a single dangerous tile out of my grasp!"`
`"......Hau~`
` I wonder what they're talking about? I wonder.`
` ...I'm sure it's a trick.`
` Ooishi-san, be careful.`
` Whenever Mii-chan and the others smile like that, they've got an evil plan up their sleeves."`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` All of the club members are playing, so I'm prepared for that, of course!`
` But we're not going to go down quite so easily!`
` Riiiight?"`
`"Riiiight☆"`
`...Wow, they're two peas in a pod.`
` ...I don't know how Rena really feels, but she certainly seems happy right now.`
`"...Maebara-kun.`
` I need to discard a tile, but it's the dora.`
` Judging by the state of the game, Ooishi-san wants to call it...`
` actually, he could even be going for a cheap hand to win right away. `
`...You said you had a way to look at our opponents' hands, right?`
` Can you check to see if it's safe?"`
`"There it is!`
` Rika-chan, how's it look?!"`
`"There it is.`
` How is it, Hanyuu?"`
`"Au au.`
` Ooishi's hand is a jumbled mess. He doesn't have anything ready."`
`"...It's a complete mess."`
`"Heh heh, you heard her, Akasaka-san."`
`"...All right.`
` I'll discard it."`
`"Nfoh hoh hoh!!`
` Rooon!!"`
`H-Hanyuuuuuuuuu!!!`
`"A-Au au au au au?!`
` B-But look, Ooishi's hand is a mess right now?!?!"`
`Ooishi turned his hand over and plucked the winning tile right into it.`
`...Yes, at a glance, it looked like a jumbled mess—but only because he purposely hadn't organized his tiles.`
`Once a person gets to veteran-level and above in mahjong, they can easily read where another player's discarded tiles came from in their hand and, to an extent, predict what else they had.`
`So he'd kept his tiles out of order on purpose—a high-level technique to confuse his opponents!`
`"That's not like you, Akasaka-san.`
` Nfu fu fu!!"`
`"......Guh..."`
`Ah, Akasaka's making a face.`
` ...He probably thinks we aren't reliable.`
`Grr.`
` I can't stand being thought of as useless because of Hanyuu.`
`...In any case, now that Hanyuu won't be of any help, the only thing we can do is watch their struggle and hope.`
`"Hau~~!!`
` Pon for me~!`
` Once more as a bonus: pon~!!"`
`"All right, Ryuugu-san, just a moment longer~!`
` Here, kan!`
` My, how strange—Ryuugu-san's open pon is worth three dora now~!"`
`"Hau~!!`
` Ooishi-san, that was wonderful~!!`
` Hau hau hau ☆!!"`
`"...Crap. It looks like Rena's the attacker, and Ooishi-san is her backup!"`
`"Kei-chan, Akasaka-san's hand is cheap, but it's nearly done!`
` Rena's three dora are scary.`
` Deal in and end the hand!`
` You'll lose points, but Akasaka-san will get back what he lost in the last hand!"`
`"All right, got it. Akasaka-san, this one, right?!"`
`"Nice discard.`
` Ron!`
` Pinfu, with one dora!"`
`"Aahhhhhh!!`
` Keiichi-kun, that was mean!!"`
`"Sorry, Rena.`
` I'm serious too!!`
` Akasaka-san, we can't lose this match no matter what!`
` Please, lend me your strength!!"`
`"Of course!`
` And I'll get a first-class seat with a luxury meal on the way home!!"`
`Before we knew it, an audience had formed, and there was a rare level of excitement in the parlor.`
`Generally, to prevent cheating, parlors didn't allow people to watch other players' games.`
`The only time people could gather like this was when some special event was going on.`
`"...Nfu fu.`
` Well, you got me.`
` I'll just have to declare riichi!"`
`The onlookers stirred.`
`In a short east round-only match, people normally prioritized quick, surefire wins over high value hands.`
`Declaring riichi added a yaku and got you more points, but it meant declaring you were in tenpai, so it would make your opponents cautious.`
`...In other words, it made them go against the fundamental concept of a short match!`
`"Keiichi-san, my trap senses are tingling!!`
` It must be a trap!"`
`"I trust you, Satoko!`
` What kind of trap could it be?!"`
`"From what this ol' man can see, Rena's hand has been too quiet...`
` She's been in tenpai for a few turns now, switching dora and red tiles into her hand...`
` And now she's on a clear double-sided wait...?"`
`"...I don't understand any of that.`
` How is that and Ooishi's riichi a trap?"`
`"Anyway, it's my turn.`
` I'm on support, so I can discard more easily than Akasaka-san.`
` I'll have to discard something already out so I don't deal in.`
` Any tiles Ooishi-san already discarded are perfectly safe, right? `
`Like this one?"`
`"Keiichi-san, that's the trap!!!`
` I bet Rena-san's waiting on the safe tile Ooishi-san just used to declare riichi with!!"`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!"`
`"Setting up one obvious trap to draw your attention, then putting the real one somewhere else!`
` It's the very first thing you learn in trap school!!"`
`"......Well... Hm.`
` That's possible.`
` But we can't ignore Ooishi-san's riichi, either.`
` This is a difficult situation!"`
`The audience hummed.`
` That reaction told us our read was probably true.`
`Rena's team seemed to realize we'd seen through their trap, and started grinning at each other, wondering how we'd get past it!`
`"...If we keep going, eventually Akasaka-san will have to discard dangerous tiles..."`
`"...Don't we win if Akasaka gets first place?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Which means we have to take the safe route to minimize risks.`
` Fortunately, that dangerous tile is in Kei-chan's hand, too.`
`In other words, Kei-chan has to discard that tile and step on the landmine first!"`
`"Au au!`
` Akasaka's hand is very pretty.`
` And pretty hands are worth a lot of points!"`
`"...I see. Akasaka can't pass such a good hand up.`
` Then it falls to Keiichi to be the outrider!"`
`"I'm sorry, but please!"`
`"Even if I get last place, Akasaka-san just has to get in first...!`
` All right.`
` Here I go!!`
` Uooryahhh!!"`
`He slammed down the dangerous tile...!!`
`And?!`
` Did it pass?!`
`"Nfu fu fu~ How unfortunate indeed."`
`"Hau~`
` ...Unfortunate indeed."`
`"Q-Quit being so vague about it!`
` Did it go through or didn't it?!"`
`"Oh, it went through.`
` Nfu fu!"`
`We made it through, somehow.`
` ...But Mion didn't let the subtle movement from Rena escape her!`
`"...Rena's good at seeing through other people's lies, but not so good at hiding her own, is she?`
` Ku ku ku. Your eyes just drifted there for a moment."`
`"H-Hau...`
` No they didn't..."`
`Mion knew.`
` That tile was the tile Rena needed!`
`But Rena overlooked it, avoiding a direct hit on Keiichi on purpose.`
` Why?`
` Because she wanted to go for our team's ace, Akasaka!!`
`"How naive, Ooishi-san.`
` Maybe you should have let her ron."`
`"...Hmm~?`
` I'm not sure what you're on about.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`"Well, then I'll just discard the same tile now."`
`"Hrm...!"`
`Ooishi's expression twisted in anguish...!`
`The rules of mahjong state that once you've let your winning tile go,`
` and that winning tile is discarded again before your turn comes,`
` you're not allowed to win off of it!!`
`They'd seen through the trap perfectly and evaded it with brilliant team play, and the crowd began to stir, satisfied, with praise.`
`"But my riichi is still in effect!!`
` Ryuugu-san, it looks like they saw through us!`
` You should go all in and declare riichi!!"`
`"Hau~~!!`
` Rena riichis too!!`
` The same as Ooishi-san, hau hau hau~☆!"`
`"...He's good!`
` Akasaka's hand is in tenpai!`
` What will you do, Akasaka-san?`
` Go for it?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Nobody's hand is changing at this point!`
`All right, I'll declare riichi too!!"`
`"""Woooaaahhhhhh!!"""`
`"Oh, really now?!`
` We're both in riichi over here!`
` Will you really be able to win?!"`
`"Hau, you got in the way of Rena and Ooishi-san's private riichi, boo hoo!!`
` But it's okay, because Keiichi-kun will give me my tile.`
` Won't you?"`
`"Gah, just can it...!!`
` My hand's coming along too.`
` With just one more good tile, I'll turn this situation around!"`
`"...I see. In some rounds, everyone has a fast hand.`
` People are often waiting on the same tile in times like these.`
` Please be careful!"`
`"Ahh, a double ron could happen...`
`...Kei-chan, if you deal into a double ron in an east round, we won't be able to recover...!!"`
`"I wouldn't discard it even if you told me to!!"`
`"...But the further along your hand gets, Keiichi, the less tiles you'll be able to discard.`
` It will get more and more dangerous!"`
`"Crap, do I keep going, or play it safe...?!"`
`"Kei-chan, try getting as far as you can first.`
` If you end up with a dangerous tile, then you can abandon your hand."`
`"Right, got it!`
` Huh?`
` This tile is...`
` Oh, it fits!"`
`"...Urgh. It fits, but not in a good way...`
` You don't have tanyao or pinfu.`
` You're in tenpai without a yaku!"`
`"A-Au au au!!`
` I've been watching the whole time, so I know this is right!`
` That tile on the end of the wall in front of Ooishi, the one with a scuffed corner, is the tile Ooishi needs!!"`
`"Really?!`
` You know for sure?!"`
`"Y-Yes, I do.`
` Ooishi has the yaku where all his tiles come in pairs, so there's only one tile he doesn't have!"`
`"Oh.`
` I know that yaku.`
` It's called chiitoitsu, right?"`
`"I get it. It's easy to control your discards when going for a chiitoi.`
` It's the best yaku for the team's support!`
` Who will end up drawing that tile?"`
`"...1 2 3 4,`
` 1 2 3 4,`
` oh, that isn't good!!`
` It'll be Akasaka-san's draw!!"`
`"Hau~ Satoko-chan is making a worried face.`
` I wonder why, I wonder why?!"`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` I know why.`
` That's the face of someone who just drew the wrong tile!"`
`""Nfu fu fu fu fu~ hau~!!""`
`"...Rika-chan.`
` Will Kei-chan's unneeded tile pass?"`
`"Umm, I'll check!`
` ...Hanyuu?!"`
`"Au au au au au au, it's fine.`
` It's okay!`
` This time, I know it!"`
`"She says this time it's for sure."`
`"All right...`
` Kei-chan, discard it and declare riichi."`
`"H-Hey, wait!`
` If I do that, I'll have to discard whatever I draw.`
` Since both our enemies are in riichi, I won't be able to avoid it! My defenses will be down!"`
`"...I... I get it.`
` That's an option too!`
` Akasaka-san, are you all right with that?!"`
`"......It was a good hand, but if the enemy's sure to draw their winning tile, we don't have a choice!`
` Please do it!"`
`"All right, Kei-chan, time to riichi!!"`
`"D-Damn...!`
` Don't blame me for what happens!!`
` If this passes... Riichi!!"`
`"M-Mgh..."`
`Once again, Ooishi made a face.`
`And another wave of noise came from the crowd of onlookers.`
`...I had no idea what it meant, since I didn't know the rules, but it seemed like that was a masterful play.`
` ...I wonder why?`
`"It passed, right?`
` Great!`
` With all four players in riichi, this hand ends in a draw!"`
`"......Ha... Hauu...`
` A draw?`
` It's over...?"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` Now, Rena-san, if you wouldn't mind showing us your hand?!"`
`Rena revealed her hand, and another loud stir rippled through the crowd.`
`From their reaction, I guessed she had a fairly high-value yaku.`
`...Mion never ceased to impress.`
` She knew we had a poor chance at winning, so she forced a draw.`
`"Agh... So close...!`
` If she'd pulled off her haneman, we would've had it in the bag...!"`
`"We won't let you win so easily.`
` I'm serious, and Maebara-kun and the rest are just as serious.`
` We're in this for the long haul!!"`
`"Nah ha ha ha!`
` This has turned into quite the interesting night!`
` A high-level battle indeed!`
` This is the kind of mahjong I've always wanted to play!!"`
`"Yes, and my blood is boiling for the first time in a while.`
` It's time to get even more serious!!"`
`"But it won't work.`
` Rena is here, so Ooishi-san is going to win for sure.`
` After all, Rena and Ooishi-san were fated to meet again ever since their previous lives. `
`Rena and Ooishi-san will become legendary mahjong players together!`
` Hau hau hau~☆"`
`"...You fell in love with Tomitake-san, so you started using cameras.`
` With Takano-san, you said you wanted to do your very own watanagashi.`
` And with Ooishi-san, you learned about mahjong. `
`You just fly headlong into everything, don't you?!"`
`"Hau~!!`
` Rena would do anything for the person she loves!`
` This is where we settle things!!!`
` Hau~ I think I'll chi that!!`
` I'm taking it home with me!!"`
`"Heh, I'm not letting you.`
` I'm ponning that.`
` Give it to me!!"`
`"Great, and I'll use the chance to riichi!!`
` Now, if Keiichi-kun deals in, I'll have a riichi ippatsu pinfu tanyao—a mangan!"`
`"Then I'll pon that to get rid of the ippatsu!!`
` Without that, it's only three han!`
` Your hand just got a lot cheaper!"`
`"And Rena will pon the tile Ooishi-san discarded!!`
` And now here's one for you, Ooishi-san☆"`
`"I'll kan that!!`
` Make or break time! Will I crush you with a rinshan?!"`
`"B-Bring it ooooooon!`
` Draaaaaw iiiiiiiiiitttt!!!"`
`Mahjong is a game where luck and skill are intertwined.`
`Even the greatest of veterans can be overturned by luck.`
`But the game is too deep for amateurs to win with just luck alone!`
`Those who won in the end were only those with enough passion to create their own luck...!!`
`"Bring it to me now, uwoohhhryaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`"Please, God in heaven!!`
` Let Ooishi-san draw what he needs~~!!`
` Hau!!!"`
`Ba-bummm!!`
` But it wasn't enough!!`
` Ooishi, no rinshan!`
`Which means Ooishi's team can no longer stop Akasaka from winning!!`
`"All right, this is the one!!"`
`"Nice discard!`
` That's ron.`
` Riichi, pinfu, tanyao!`
` Now I'm finally at the top."`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` We've done it!!"`
`"But it's not over, and he doesn't have a big lead!`
` Let's not get ahead of ourselves!"`
`"Hau~ The game isn't over!!`
` The power of Rena's love can turn this around. Piece of cake!"`
`...The match seemed unthinkably intense from the position of an idle spectator...`
` but Rena still truly impressed me.`
`We all knew a bit about the rules of mahjong from when it came up during club, but she shouldn't have been strong enough to sit at the same table as Ooishi and his group. `
`...And yet, she fell in love with Ooishi because of the Magatama of Fuwarazu,`
` studied enough to match his abilities, and actually caught up with him.`
`"...Meep.`
` Rena has surprisingly terrifying latent abilities..."`
`"This incident has proven beyond a doubt that Rena is incredible!"`
`"Yeah... This ol' man thinks she's pretty good."`
`"She's more than pretty good!`
` Even without this team match, Rena still has the ability to rival Ooishi-san and Akasaka-san!"`
`"Ah, that's not what I meant.`
` ...I was just thinking, well, that trying to match her tastes to the one she likes and putting all of her effort into it is praiseworthy itself.`
`When you start to like someone, the first thing you'd do is try and pull them into your own world, right?`
` You'd try and get them to like the things you like."`
`"...Isn't that the normal thing to do?"`
`"That's what I would do.`
` There's probably more of us than you think.`
`...But Rena's different.`
` Whether it's Tomitake-san, or Miyo-san, or Ooishi-san.`
` She tried her very best to match herself to their interests. `
`The short time she took to learn it all is crazy, of course, but I'm not surprised about that as much as I am about her putting in the effort to match her partner."`
`"Perhaps you're correct...`
` All that work matching yourself to them would be exhausting, wouldn't it...?"`
`"Right?`
` Maybe pulling someone into your own world means tiring them out.`
`So if you were a good couple from the start, you'd both have to step into the other's world to an extent. `
`...But not many people try to meet them halfway without being asked.`
` Everyone else tries to make the other person step into their own footprint, but don't make the effort to step into the other's."`
`......For some reason, Mion's uncharacteristic musing hurt a little.`
`"......I understand what you mean.`
` I think I always pulled others in, and never tried to step into their world.`
` ...That probably goes for Satoko, too.`
` And Mii. `
`......By the way, Mii, you never let anyone who asked into the club, but you actually approached Keiichi yourself, didn't you?"`
`"Uh, huh?!`
` Ah, aha ha ha, did I?!`
` Well, err, there were no ulterior motives there, aha ha ha ha, this ol' man doesn't know what you mean~!"`
`...If there was anything this incident taught me.`
` ...It was that Rena would be a great wife in the future.`
`"...Which means we have to settle this match as soon as we can and get Rena back into her right mind."`
`"...Yes, we do...`
` ...All day, I've been thinking of Rena-san as a funny person...`
` but she's not funny at all—in fact, we should be learning from her."`
`"Hey, would you old ladies in the crowd quit trading gossip?!`
` More importantly, check to see whether this one will pass!"`
`"Aye aye, sir!"`
`"Hau~ Hau hau hau~!`
` If it's the right one, it will hurt~!!`
` Oh, this one is Ooishi-san's!`
` Here you go~!"`
`"Nfu fu fu.`
` Ron!`
` Rena-san and I are the greatest team on the planet!!`
` Boy, if only you had been born twenty years earlier!"`
`"Hau~ Our age difference doesn't mean anything~!!`
` Ooishi-san and Rena, the greatest team!`
` Hau☆"`
`"...Keiichi.`
` ...We all know now how good a person Rena really is.`
` ...Let's...`
` end this farce."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I don't know what kind of love she'll have or what kind of person she'll marry.`
` ...But that's for Rena to decide.`
` ...She doesn't need any creepy magic to help her out!"`
`Hanyuu mumbled in protest, but I ignored her.`
`Some might want to borrow that magic's strength, but others would create their own destiny without relying on another's power.`
` ...Rena was obviously the latter sort.`
`Well... There is no former or latter.`
`Everyone wants to create their own destiny, with their own strength.`
`When you start thinking that some people can do that but others can't, it's like admitting to yourself that you're one of the ones who can't do it.`
`...Rena's force of will seemed divine.`
`She laughed in such a vulgar way, but she looked noble.`
`I've lived one hundred years, but I didn't think I could come anywhere near the lesson Rena, who hasn't even lived half that time, had made me learn.`
`That broad smile of Rena's was only for the person she had truly decided on.`
`Eventually, the heated match ended, and we tallied the scores.`
`There were no huge hands, only the trading of a few point sticks here and there, so it seemed like they found it difficult to know who won.`
`Ooishi and Rena both seemed like they'd won to a certain extent.`
`Keiichi was certain to be dead last, but he did a good job giving Akasaka support.`
`If he could take first place, they'd win as a team, so Keiichi getting last was decided from the start.`
`"Oh,`
` oh,`
` oh,`
` oh,`
` ooohhhh!!`
` We did it, Akasaka-san is first place!!`
` Yeeeeeahhh!!"`
`"...Phew!!`
` It looks like all the point sticks from the four-way riichi did a lot."`
`"Aaaahhhhh... Hau... We loooost..."`
`"No, no!`
` We may have lost the match, but we were in a dominant position from beginning to end!`
` In a normal mahjong game, we would have won by a landslide!`
` Well, really, winning or losing doesn't matter. `
`We got to play some truly excellent mahjong.`
` Ryuugu-san, you're very good at getting your partner fired up. At making mahjong fun.`
`...But I can't say I'm all right with you coming here by yourself so late.`
` If you're going to come here, please do it once you're an adult, all right?"`
`"...Hau...`
` ...Okaaay..."`
`"We won the game, but I feel like we've lost something else."`
`"...Heh heh. We'll chalk it up to Rena being amazing.`
` ...*yaaaaaaawn*`
` With all that tension gone, I'm tired all of a sudden, even though it's still early..."`
`"Oh, yes, I promised to give back this key ring, didn't I—whoops?!`
`Sorry!!"`
`When Ooishi plucked the magatama from his pocket, his fingers slipped and flung it away!`
` And... wh-why did Keiichi have to choose that exact moment to yawn?!`
`"Ngah?!`
` Nggnhh!!!`
` Aaahhhh?!`
` I-I-I swallowed it!!"`
`"Wh-What?!`
` What are you doing, Kei-chan?!`
` Throw it up, throw it up!!`
` This ol' man will punch you in the abdomen. Satoko, hold his arms behind his back!!`
` And...`
` wham`
` wham!!"`
`"G-Gwehh!!`
` P-Please stoooop!!"`
`"Oh, be quieeeeeeeeeeeet!!"`
`"Fghoh, gwehh!!`
` My body's going to regret this later!!"`
`"Ha...Hanyuu...`
` Does this mean we're too late?"`
`"Au au au au au!!`
` Once it goes into someone's stomach, it gets melted down and absorbed!`
` We need to do something before thirty minutes go by!!`
`But we have the red and white magatama now! `
`If we take Keiichi and Rena to the Furude Shrine, I can undo the curse right away!"`
`"All right, then, we're bringing the two of them to the shrine before they do something they can't take back!`
` Come on, Mii, Satoko!`
` We're dragging them over there!!"`
`""Aye aye, sir!!!""`
