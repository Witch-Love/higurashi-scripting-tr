`"Treasure hunting!!`
` There's two fun things about it.`
` One is obviously finding kyute treasures, but do you know the other?!"`
`"...Getting all sweaty, not finding anything, realizing how precious our lives and time are, snapping out of it, and going home?"`
`They say you don't get tired when you're having fun, but... Where in that slender body was Rena storing all this horsepower?`
`Rummaging through an oversized garbage heap was exhausting in and of itself.`
`It didn't take long for me to pull out a picnic blanket, spread it on a decommissioned vehicle's roof, and sprawl out on it.`
`"Nooo, that isn't it!`
` It's the time you spend looking and wondering what kind of kyute things you'll happen to find.`
` That's what makes it so much fun, even if you don't find anything."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Well, it wasn't boring for me, either.`
` Thanks to all the work, this bottle of barley tea you brought tastes great!`
` This is definitely better than the stuff at my house. `
`How should I put it—it's like they smell different, or something."`
`"That's the normal kind.`
` You just put a pack in a teapot and boil it to get the flavor."`
`"Oh, boiling it must be the secret!`
` We just dump cold water in and put it in the fridge.`
` I guess you don't get the flavor if you don't heat it up first."`
`"Oh, that's right, I forgot!"`
`Rena pounded her fist, then put her treasure hunting aside for the moment and came over to me.`
`Then, she brought over a bag and took something out before unwrapping it.`
`...Why, how considerate! They're cookies! Their lack of uniformity meant they had to be homemade.`
`"Did you make these yourself!?`
` I'd be glad to have some.`
` Mm, yep, these are great!"`
`"They're leftovers from yesterday.`
` Dad ate most of them, so there weren't many left.`
` Rena didn't even get to have that many."`
`"I see, I see, so I shouldn't eat them all myself.`
` I'll just eat half.`
` You have some too!`
` These are cookies after my own heart!`
` Mm, munch munch!`
` This flavor, this texture, oh, they're extraordinary!!"`
`"Rena doesn't need any, so you can eat them all, Keiichi-kun.`
` You look so happy with them, so both Rena and the cookies she made are really happy too."`
`"Really?`
` Guess I don't need to hold myself back!!`
` I could kill!`
` I could kill a man just to have one of these cookies!!`
` Munch munch munch!!"`
`"Ahahaha, that's a terrible thing to say, but I'm happy. I am!"`
`This fun moment sitting together...`
`Going with Rena on a treasure hunt was the right choice.`
`...If I only ended up shutting myself up in my room with Mion's comics, it would have been rude to the day itself!`
`Scarlet began to creep into the sky.`
`Flocks of birds started flying past...  Maybe they were going back to their nests.`
`Rena had already put away the cookie wrappers. ...It looked like it was time to go.`
`"So what did you dig up today?"`
`"Hmm, hopes for tomorrow, I guess!"`
`"This pile goes a lot deeper~!`
` I'm sure something will turn up.`
` Rena can tell by the smell, hau~!!"`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` If you say something will turn up, I'm sure it will.`
` Don't lose heart!`
` Will it be gold, or a hot spring?!`
` I can't wait."`
`"If I go treasure hunting tomorrow too, will you come with me?"`
`"Hm?`
` Me?`
` Hmm.`
` I'll consider it if I can eat more of your homemade cookies."`
`"I-I didn't bake any more cookies, so I won't have them tomorrow...`
` ...If I don't make cookies... you won't come?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ahahahaha, don't look at me with those eyes!`
` O-O-Okay, I get it!`
` I'll help you, so don't give me that look!`
` You'll break my glass conscience~!"`
`"Hee hee, ahahahahahaha!`
` I got Keiichi-kun to help me tomorrow~!`
` When Keiichi-kun is with me, hau, it's fun even if I don't find anything.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`Rena usually went treasure hunting alone, but she probably also had fun doing it with friends once in a while.`
`She gave me a fresh, invigorating smile, the kind she didn't usually show anyone during club games.`
`After that, we decided to clean up, pack up, and leave.`
`And the moment we went up the embankment, there was a sudden dazzling flash!`
`"Ack, my eyes!"`
`"Hah-hahaha!`
` Caught those blissful smiles on candid camera!"`
`"T-Tomitake-san.`
` And Takano-san, too!`
` Hello~!"`
`"Hee hee. Hello there.`
` Jirou-san has no tact, does he?`
` Wrecking your date like that..."`
`"I-It wasn't a date or anything. Not a date, not a date!`
` Right, Rena?!"`
`"H-Hauuu."`
`"Ha ha ha ha!`
` A boy and a girl coming to an empty place like this to talk about the future?`
` Well, well, that's fine!`
` That's the kind of discussion that will strengthen the bond between you.`
` Right, Takano-san?"`
`"Hee hee.`
` Back when we first met, Jirou-san would always have the funniest, most awkward ways of asking me out."`
`"I remember one masterful excuse in particular.`
` What was it..."`
`"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there!!`
` That was my mistake, and, well!!"`
`Takano-san ran off, giggling, and Tomitake-san chased after her.`
`From afar, they looked like they had to be a great couple.`
`"They seemed mismatched at first, but they like each other a lot."`
`"Yeah.`
` They have completely opposite personalities. Maybe they went together like the bumps and dents in puzzle pieces."`
`"Hau...`
` Just like a bump and a dent.`
` Hau hau, what do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean."`
`"N-N-N... No, no, I wasn't trying to say anything weird!`
` Stop blushing! You're only making this more awkward!!"`
`"I wonder, I wonder!!`
` Bumps and dents~~ bump dent bump dent~!!`
` ○△凸※◎~!!!"`
`Ahhh, oh no, Rena's completely broken!`
`The only way to solve this is her usual method: punching me out cold.`
`All right, Rena, I'm prepared! Give me your usual lightning-fast punch and KO me in an instant!!`
`But then, something flew towards Rena and clunked her in the head. What was that?!`
`Rena suddenly choked up and fell to her knees, coughing over and over in a way that clearly wasn't normal.`
`"H-Hey, what's wrong?!`
` Are you okay, Rena?!"`
`I rubbed Rena's back as she coughed. ...What the heck just happened?!`
`"What's the matter?!`
` Are you all right, Rena-chan?!"`
`"Hang on.`
` Can you breathe?!"`
`"Did you two throw something and hit Rena just now?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`I definitely saw it. Something came flying and hit Rena in the head.`
`I was sure it was something Tomitake-san or Takano-san had thrown... but they wouldn't do something so mean, would they?`
`Then what was it? Are you telling me that whatever it was fell from the heavens, or something?`
`"Are you all right, Rena...?!`
` Do you need a handkerchief?"`
`"...Th... Thanks...`
` uuuu... *cough* *cough*...!"`
`"Did you swallow something the wrong way?`
` Have you calmed down?"`
`"I-I was looking at the sky and fooling around... when something suddenly flew into my mouth... and I swallowed it...`
` uuuu..."`
`"Swallowed it!?`
` What did you swallow?`
` Does your stomach hurt or anything?!"`
`"It doesn't, but... I feel a little strange..."`
`"...I wonder why.`
` Did a bug fly into your mouth?"`
`"If it's bothering you, you should try vomiting.`
` They should have a sink at the office site you can use.`
` Drink a lot of water, then put your finger in the back of your throat and throw it all up."`
`"That's a good idea...!`
` Rena, I'll help you stand, so let's go!"`
`"...Huh...?`
` ...I feel better..."`
`"What?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` It felt like something was rolling around in my stomach, but it went away.`
` ...I don't feel it anymore."`
`"Are you sure it was nothing?`
` I hope you're all right..."`
`"...If it's really bothering you, we can take an X-ray of your stomach to see if there's a need to remove it.`
` Are you sure it was nothing?"`
`"...Yes.`
` Yep, I'm totally fine now.`
` Even I don't get it.`
` ...I'm fit as a fiddle."`
`"Really...?`
` Should we go to the clinic and have Coach look at you, just in case?"`
`"No, I'm good!`
` I'll do that if I feel sick tomorrow.`
` But I'm all better for today.`
` Thanks for worrying about me, everyone."`
`The person concerned said it was nothing, so there was no point in prying any further.`
`We said farewell to Tomitake-san and Takano-san, and then I walked Rena back to her house.`
`At first, I was worried about Rena suddenly growing worse. But as I listened to her go on and on about how fun today's treasure hunt was,`
`My worries drifted away, and we got to talking about going hunting again tomorrow.`
`"Bye, Keiichi-kun.`
` Thanks for taking me home!`
` If club tomorrow ends early, let's go treasure hunting together again!"`
`"Yeah!`
` And thanks for the cookies and barley tea today!!"`
`"It won't be homemade,`
` but I'll bring some kind of snack tomorrow.`
` Please look forward to it~!"`
`"Awesome!!`
` I can't wait!"`
`Rena's mood seemed so good that she was fit to burst.`
`As I watched her, I completely forgot about the fuss over the foreign object earlier...`
