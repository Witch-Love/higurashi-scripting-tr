`"...Meep, it couldn't be?"`
`"You saw it too, Rika?`
` I knew it, no doubt about it...!"`
`Satoko seemed to have sensed something, and walked up to me. And then,`
`"Keiichi-san, please pay close attention!`
`...That pitch Rena-san just threw was a slider!"`
`"A slider? ...What's that?"`
`"You haven't heard of it?!`
` It's a breaking ball that travels at nearly the same speed as a fastball before bending away from the batter! `
`In some ways it's even harder to hit than a curveball. A magic pitch that the pros use!"`
`"Wh-whaaat?!`
` How is Rena able to throw pitches like that?!"`
`"Well... isn't it because she read those biographies?`
` Of great pitchers in history?"`
`"What the...?!`
` There's no way pro baseball players would be raking in the huge salaries they get if that was all it took to learn magic pitcheees!!"`
`"...But she really is throwing them, though.`
` I'd like to say I expected as much from Rena-san... but honestly, I was surprised too."`
`"...Meep.`
` No matter how powerful that magatama may be, Rena is amazing for being able to throw a magic pitch for the sake of the person she loves."`
`"T-true..."`
`As we were talking, Rena began her third at-bat. Kameda-kun was halfway teary-eyed as he threw the third pitch. And then,`
`*craaaack*`
`"E-eeeeeek?!"`
`The ball was again batted at an arc, sending it soaring high in the bright blue sky.`
`But... fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, the trajectory sent it beyond the foul line, so it was declared a foul ball.`
`"...Though, judging it by distance alone, that hit was good even for a pinch hitter."`
`"...Gh."`
`I shuddered, once again reminded that I'm up against one hell of an opponent.`
`"...Tch, guess I hit that one a little too strong.`
` All right Keiichi-kun, come step up for your third at-bat.`
` Are you prepared for this?`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"...!"`
`The power difference between us was on full display as I stepped up to the plate.`
`Is this next one going to be a breaking ball? Or a straight shot...?`
`Damn it, worrying about all these additional pitch options, I can't stay focused...!`
`"...Take that!"`
`Rena's pitch was coming in the outside corner.`
`Just barely within hitting range!`
