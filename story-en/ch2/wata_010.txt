`...There was no way I'd be able to sleep.`
`When she hung up the phone like that, I realized for the first time what kind of situation I was in, as well as who the only ally who would support me was.`
`I waited with bated breath for Shion to calm down and call me back.`
`What would I do if the phone rang while I was sound asleep...?`
`No matter how long I waited, however, it never rang.`
`......Exhausted, whenever my mind started to wander, I would jolt awake as though I heard the phone ring.`
`In the end, I brought the cordless phone with me into my futon and went to sleep with it in my arms.`
`...Though it still didn't amount to anything...`
`Morning came, and by that time, I was pretty sure she wasn't calling back.`
`...That was when a fierce drowsiness assailed me.`
`"Damn it...!`
` This is no time for sleep, Keiichi Maebara!"`
`I slapped myself in the face a few times.`
`Then, I went to the washroom and washed my face, which was something I usually didn't do.`
`...That wasn't enough, either, so I even brushed my teeth.`
`After that, I was finally wide awake.`
`When Mom saw how strange I was acting, her eyes went wide...`
`"What's wrong, Keiichi?`
` Are you going somewhere today?"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you don't look so good today.`
` ...Do you have a cold?"`
`"...I'm not sick, I just didn't get much sleep.`
` If I space out and start talking nonsense, just humor me..."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` I wonder what kind of nonsense you'll say! I wonder!`
` ...Now I'm looking forward to it. Hau."`
`I felt utterly shattered, and I still hadn't picked myself back up this morning—and for precisely that reason, Rena's honest smile was a sight for sore eyes.`
`"Yo.`
` ...What's up, Kei-chan? Rena?`
` Good morning."`
`"Whaaat?`
` Mii-chan, you look like you didn't get much sleep either! Either!"`
`Her usual cheerfulness was completely buried in shadow.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I went to bed at like, three.`
` ...I'm a little tired."`
`I understand, I've done that before."`
`I joked, trying to shake off my sleepiness. I was trying to be considerate.`
`...However, neither Mion nor Rena smiled—in fact, they didn't even pay attention.`
`Rena's expression immediately darkened.`
`"............What?`
` ...Wait... is it about the mayor?`
` He still hasn't been found?"`
`"......Nope."`
`"Hey, wait a minute.`
` What are you talking about? You can't find the mayor?"`
`Even the classroom, which was normally bursting with bright, joking voices seemed filled with a different sort of murmur today.`
`"Good morning, Keiichi-san.`
` ...Have you heard?`
` It looks like something terrible has happened."`
`"...I don't really know this mayor person... but he's an old guy, right?`
` Couldn't he just be wandering around, senile?"`
`"The mayor is certainly not senile.`
` He's a sprightly man who can teach both calligraphy and swordsmanship."`
`"......He probably got lost somewhere, like me."`
`"...A-A lost Rika!☆`
` Hau~~~! I wanna take you home with me~~!!"`
`...Getting lost is only 'kyute' because children like Rika-chan do it.`
` ...A worn-out old man getting lost isn't moe in the slightest!`
`...While my mind entertained dumb thoughts like that, our teacher arrived.`
`Everyone rushed to their seats.`
`"Good morning,`
` everyone."`
`Good morning!`
`The class greeting was normal, but...`
` ...the atmosphere in the room was heavy.`
`"Some of you may have already heard...`
` but last night, despite the late hour, the mayor never came home.`
` Is there anyone here who saw the mayor yesterday?"`
`...One or two hands went up in the silence, and they told her about having seen him.`
`...None of it seemed to be vital information, however, and everyone began whispering amongst themselves...`
`"If anyone has seen the mayor, please tell an adult about it, all right?`
` ...Now then, let's begin class."`
`After that, the same old lessons began.`
`The rumors, once quieted, blossomed in flowers again at lunchtime.`
`...I could hear a few different conversations.`
`They were mostly related to the mayor's disappearance.`
`...Summing them all up, I came out with this.`
`Yesterday evening, the mayor went to a meeting at the shrine's assembly hall.`
`The meeting ended after the sun had fully set, and everyone left.`
`The elder's house was a bit far from the center of Hinamizawa.`
`...It was already late, and Hinamizawa doesn't have a lot of lights outside.`
` ...Nobody saw the mayor after the meeting.`
`However, because he would have been hungry, he wouldn't have taken any side trips—he would have gone straight home.`
`...However, no matter how long his family waited...`
` ...he never returned.`
`Some thought there might have been an accident.`
`...They left no stone unturned—they searched from the irrigation channels to the water wells, and even in the rice paddies, but they didn't find him.`
`Of course... there was a limit to how far they could search in the middle of the night.`
`The police were going to wait for daylight, then have the young men of the town help search.`
` If after all that they still didn't find him, they were apparently even going to go looking in the mountains.`
`Even now, at this moment, the adults were probably all searching for him...`
`...The more they searched in vain...`
`...and the more time passed...`
`...the only thing that came to mind was...`
` ...the curse.`
` The rumors of Onikakushi—of the 'demoning away.'`
`...Had he become this year's sacrifice to Oyashiro-sama's curse, which had recently been occurring every year...?`
`That scary possibility, which everybody thought about but nobody could say aloud, was slowly but surely spreading throughout the village...`
`Was he demoned away... and offered as a sacrifice to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger...?`
`My classmates were whispering to each other that the curse didn't happen this year, so there shouldn't have been any sacrifices.`
`...I, on the other hand... I knew.`
`The curse did happen again this year, and there were two people that died.`
`...This may sound strange, but... I hadn't exactly thought the elder would be the one to go missing.`
`My reason was clear.`
`...Shion and I should have been a higher priority than him.`
`The four of us were thieves that broke the taboo and set foot into the sacred ritual storehouse.`
`If Tomitake-san and Takano-san had suffered mysterious deaths... then it should have been my and Shion's turn next......`
`"...This time should have been Shion and me... eh?"`
`...I laughed painfully to myself.`
`I'd yelled at Shion over the phone that I didn't want to end up in such a terrifying situation, but...`
` now that someone other than me had disappeared, I could only think that I should have been the first to go.`
`......Onigafuchi, the bottomless swamp said to have been the place where they drowned sacrifices long ago.`
`...Just as it ran through my thoughts, the villagers must have also considered the swamp.`
`Maybe police divers were plumbing its depths even now...`
`...They probably wouldn't find anyone.`
`...Not a single missing person had ever been found.`
`They'd always suspected Onigafuchi, but not once have they ever turned up a corpse from it.`
`...After all, it was a devilish, bottomless swamp from which no one who sinks can ever return...`
`...I could hear someone telling their friend that in the classroom...`
`"...Now that you mention it, Satoshi-san... he left around this time last year, didn't he?"`
`Huh?`
` Satoshi?`
`......I've heard that name before.`
` ...He was... right, he disappeared because of last year's curse.`
`The conversation was happening in the seat next to me, so I could hear it clearly.`
`"...Didn't we search the whole village like this for Satoshi-san, too?"`
`"We didn't find him, either.`
` ...Hmm... What did we decide that was?`
` ...A demoning away, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I heard he withdrew all his savings and ran away from home.`
` Someone from the police said there was someone who saw him get on the bullet train at Nagoya Station!"`
`.........Ran away, huh?`
`I wasn't that interested in the reason, which seemed understandable in this case.`
`Everyone else who disappeared had their own reasons too.`
`Either they were still on the run because they were criminals, or they were a corpse that couldn't be found.`
`...It's not like any of them suddenly disappeared into thin air for no reason.`
`But,`
` they disappeared.`
`...Someone disappeared whenever the curse took a life, as if by design.`
`They may have had various understandable reasons, but they still disappeared.`
`.........From that point of view, it really might have been a demoning away this time.`
`The mayor's disappearance was the first such incident without a clear reason behind it.`
`...Of course, coming to that realization didn't help to resolve anything...`
`"...It looks like I messed up the seasoning today.`
` Ehehe... Sorry."`
`Normally, Rena's lunch would have been devoured immediately, but today there was still a ton left.`
`...That wasn't because Rena's lunch didn't taste good or anything, though...`
`"Th-That isn't the case.`
` Your lunch today is as delicious as always!"`
`Satoko dips her chopsticks into Rena's bento box and pulls bits of food out one after the other.`
`"Yes, delicious indeed!`
` Today in particular, in fact!`
` Chomp chomp!!"`
`"Ahahaha... Huh? You know those are pumpkin croquettes, right?`
` Are you okay?"`
`"......Nggh...... ...Y-Yes!`
` If it's your pumpkin, then it's delicious!"`
`...Did Satoko dislike pumpkin?`
`Regardless, she forced herself to smile and shoved more into her mouth.`
`...Everyone knew.`
`Nobody's lunch tasted very good today.`
`Satoko kept shoveling it down, repeating her remark on how good it was.`
`"...If it's that good, then I guess I've gotta have some, too. Satoko's gonna eat it all if we let her."`
`"I-It's just so good, so I would certainly like it if Keiichi-san were to eat some as well...!"`
`"Well, sometimes I have to show my adult generosity, right?`
` Okay, don't hold back on my account!`
` Eat enough for the both of us today!"`
`"Fu... fuwaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`...She really, really hated pumpkin, didn't she?`
`That made it all the more touching to see Satoko's own brand of generosity.`
`...I grabbed her head and started stroking it.`
`...Satoko, in a somewhat exaggerated fashion, was bawling, tears streaming down her face.`
`"No way.`
` ...You'll never grow up if you give away such good food.`
` Rena, you eat too.`
` I only have leftover vegetable stew, but it tastes great after having sat overnight."`
`"...Yeah!`
` The daikon radish has such a pretty color going through it. It looks delicious.`
` I guess I'll have some, then~"`
`Rena reached out with her chopsticks, ...and at last, the usual lunchtime atmosphere began to return.`
`That was only at our desks, however.`
`...The dark tales of Oyashiro-sama's curse, which had recurred for five years in a row, didn't cease.`
` The whole classroom remained stuck in this somber mood...`
`...Oyashiro-sama's curse had happened for five years straight.`
`Everyone had wanted the previous year to be the last.`
`...What was Oyashiro-sama's curse, anyway?`
`They were going to build a dam in Hinamizawa.`
`The people building it were bad.`
`So they were cursed.`
`...I would admit that much.`
`...Still, the dam project was frozen years ago, wasn't it?`
` So why was the curse stubbornly persisting...?`
`I hit myself on the cheeks to perk myself back up.`
`Everyone was trying so hard to brighten the mood—I couldn't go straight back to thinking about the curse like that...!`
`I forced the grim story out of my head.`
`...Driving Oyashiro-sama's curse out of my thoughts was actually a good idea.`
`...In the end, that meant I would also be driving away the most terrifying thought of all—that I could be the curse's next target...`
`"...Mion's taking a while, isn't she?`
` How long does it take to wash your hands?"`
`Mion had said she was going to wash her hands and left, and she hadn't come back yet.`
`"...Ahahaha.`
` She's probably taking a little afternoon nap somewhere.`
` ...I think she was up pretty late last night looking for the mayor, after all."`
`...I smiled wryly and let out a sigh.`
`...Today was no good.`
`However much we tried to lighten the mood, things always came back to the mayor.`
` ...It was just a no-good day.`
`...I had just transferred here recently, so the shock of a curse happening five years running was... an unimaginably big one.`
`......Maybe I do need to appreciate that.`
`"...When Mii-chan was really little, the mayor would always spoil her.`
` When she was going through her prankster phase... he loved her like his own daughter.`
` ...She's told me that often."`
`......I see.`
` ...Mion was in shock, too.`
`Someone disappearing at all because of a curse was a very scary thing.`
`...If the sacrifice was someone you knew, though... then the shock must be a hundred times worse.`
`Satoko, as if she'd come to the same conclusion, bit her lower lip and looked downward...`
`"Oh, Rika-chan is taking a while, too.`
` Maybe they're taking a nice afternoon nap together?"`
`"...Rika wasn't out that late.`
` ...As soon as she yawned, everyone gathered around her and started saying 'good night, good night!'"`
`Now that she mentioned it, there were a lot of old people rubbing their prayer beads in fervent gratitude towards Rika-chan during the festival, too...`
`An image of the indulgent elderly came to mind.`
`...Had Rika-chan discovered a way to get herself to be pampered like that...???`
`"...Is there a reason the old people treat Rika-chan like an idol?`
` Is she their ideal image of a granddaughter or something?"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` I don't know anything about that~!`
` But, b-b-b-but, I want to see Rika-chan yawning~~~!!`
` ...It's probably all like, fwaahh~...`
` ...Hau~~~!! I wanna take her home~~~!!!"`
`"......I don't personally think it's that cute.`
` ...It's more of a 'gwahh,' and she opens her mouth really wide so you can see the back of her throat...?"`
`Rena's handy at times like these...`
` I finally managed a heartfelt laugh.`
`...Oh, right.`
`I'm on day duty today, aren't I?`
` I need to go water the flower garden.`
`The garden is right outside the teacher's lounge, too, so they can immediately tell if you don't do it right.`
`"Gh-Gh-Gh, gheehehhhh~~~...!!`
` Can't... breathe......"`
`...You know, Rena is...`
` ......`
` I can't say it out loud... but she's a notorious... [censored], isn't she... (sweat)`
`Hearing Satoko make a weird noise like a chicken being strangled was kind of hilarious, and I couldn't help but laugh.`
`At some point, the classroom had erupted into laughter too.`
`...Maybe Rena was doing it on purpose.`
`Even if she wasn't, this nonsense was a welcome sight.`
`Anyway.`
`...Let's get over to the flowers while I still have time.`
`Slowly and quietly, lest I destroy the room's newfound peace, I left the classroom.`
`The watering can was hanging up outside the kitchen.`
`This building had originally been an all-male forestry service building, so there was apparently nothing so thoughtful as a garden here before.`
`When they decided to have a school share the space, they built one there as a modest gesture of appreciation.`
`But, well, the flower bed... it was a little... longer than you'd expect.`
`It went all around.`
`It went all over the place.`
`It was so big one would need to refill the watering can five or six times to get it all done.`
`I was doing this together with a kid who was also, thankfully, on day duty today...`
` She was in the lowest grade, though, and a full size smaller than even Rika-chan.`
`I couldn't make a kid who would struggle just to lift the full watering can help me with this...`
`......If you were placed on day duty with someone who liked this sort of thing, they'd do it all for you, so it'd be cake.`
`"No point in blaming her.`
` ...I give up. I'll just get started."`
`Watering can in hand, just as I was about to leave the building, the old man from the forestry office addressed me.`
`"Sonny, there's a vegetable garden behind the warehouse, right?`
` It's all just about dried up.`
` Water that too, would you?"`
`"Oh, you mean that curry vegetable garden?`
` The one with the potatoes and carrots, and other things that are only ingredients for curry?"`
`It's definitely the personal garden of our curry-loving teacher, but...`
`Making students responsible for its upkeep is getting them involved in her personal affairs.`
`I couldn't say that to his face, though, so I gave up and decided to carry out my day duties.`
`The sunlight out front was strong.`
`...The great chorus of cicadas was strongly underlining how nothing was different today than yesterday.`
`I passed by the classroom... and I don't know how it happened, but Rena and Satoko were in the middle of a huge melee.`
`While I was gone, the kids had arranged all the desks in a circle, forming a ring, while everyone was cheering them on.`
`......Yeah. That's how it should be.`
`Once school ended, we would need to return to reality, where talk of the elder's disappearance would once again be all over the place.`
`I wanted everyone to forget about everything and have fun, just like yesterday, if only while they were at school.`
`In that sense, Satoko's whirling elbow and Rena's backwards flying spin-kick made for a pleasant sight.`
`...Even if, as a result, they flipped over my desk...`
` Agh, that's my pencil box!!`
` ...Guh...... I'll just let it happen today.`
`I set to work, hastily watering everything, wanting nothing more than to be done as soon as possible.`
`That should about do it!`
` No sooner had I thought that than I remembered that I had to water the teacher's curry vegetable garden too.`
`"...That's such a pain...  but I have a feeling that it'll come back to bite me if I don't."`
`I gave up, filled the can with water again, and headed behind the warehouse.`
`This was a place students didn't like to go—it was always damp here, and you couldn't discard the possibility of slugs and pill bugs being around.`
`So when I ran across her in a place like that, I was surprised.`
`"Whoa!!`
` Oh... it's Rika-chan.`
` ...Don't scare me like that..."`
`Rika-chan was just standing there like a puppet... devoid of life...`
`...I was the only one who was startled here.`
`Rika-chan didn't even seem to react to my appearance.`
`".........Rika-chan...?"`
`...Finally, she noticed me.`
`...Her expression was clearly abnormal.`
`...There was red under her eyes... stained with tears and dirt.`
`...There were blades of grass stuck in her hair, too, and her clothes looked as though she'd fallen to the ground.`
`"Rika-chan...?!`
` Are you... are you hurt?`
` Did you fall...?!"`
`"......*hic*`
` ...N-No.`
` ...That isn't it,"`
`Rika-chan said in the brightest voice she could manage as she rubbed her eyes...`
`She didn't look anywhere near normal, though.`
`"What happened?`
` You weren't sleeping on the storehouse roof... and then fell off or anything, did you...?"`
`"......Don't worry about me.`
` I have something I want to ask you, Keiichi."`
`...Rika-chan walked over and clung to me.`
`At first, I thought she was playing a trick on me.`
`...Eventually, however... I realized it was so that I wouldn't run from the question she was about to ask...`
` I shuddered.`
`"What...`
` ...what do you want from me?"`
`She looked straight into my eyes.`
`Her upturned eyes... bored right into me.`
`...It was as though they were trying to pull the answer out of my own eyes, without actually asking me the question.`
`It was scary... so I averted my eyes from hers...`
`"......Keiichi.`
` Did you... do something bad on the night of the festival...?"`
`My body gave a jolt from its very core.`
`...Rika-chan, who was clinging to me, might have felt my shiver.`
`A nervous tingle crawled up from my feet... and after going up my back and freezing my entire body... it made its way into my brain...`
`"......Keiichi.`
` Do you really not remember?"`
`"............"`
`My head... began to throb...`
` ...I don't... I don't understand anything.`
`Mion asked me,`
`Ooishi-san asked me,`
`Shion asked me,`
`...and now Rika-chan was asking me...`
`We thought nobody knew... about what we did last night, but...`
` In fact, everyone knew...?!`
`They all knew... and they came to ask me.`
`Again, and again... until I admitted it.`
`...When I thought about it... it was pretty clear the whole thing was out in the open.`
`...After all... don't Tomitake-san and Takano-san's deaths prove it?`
`"......Keiichi?"`
`...I... how should I respond?`
`We never should have entered the forbidden storehouse... and even though I regretted it so much, was she saying it wasn't enough...?`
`...However... I had all but decided what I was going to say.`
`"I... I'm not exactly a good kid, you know?`
` ...I've done lots of bad things, so I can't remember anything specific."`
`Just as I had with all the others... I evaded the question.`
`Rika-chan... stared up at me with innocent eyes.`
`...Her eyes were so painful that I had to look away.`
`After a few moments of mutual silence, Rika-chan released me.`
`"...I'm sorry for asking you something strange.`
` Please forget about it..."`
`she said, smiling her usual smile.`
`...Then, tap tap tap tap... she went running off, as if nothing had happened.`
`...As she retreated in silence, I could feel her accusing me...`
`............`
`.........`
`"...Ri... Rika-chan...!"`
`If she didn't hear my voice, then I was going to give up.`
`...However, she heard it.`
`...Rika-chan swiveled around and waited for me to continue.`
`...I was the one who had questions now.`
`Still... asking any of them could just be... a half-assed way of admitting what I did...`
`"...Hey, Rika-chan."`
`"......What is it?"`
`...If everyone knows anyway... then I should be able... to at least ask this, right?`
`Why is everyone asking me about the night of the festival?`
`...That evening...`
` ...Had I done something... that wrong...?`
`I felt plenty sorry about it... and I only looked, anyway...`
`I didn't break anything, or steal anything.`
` ...Really!`
`...Still... Tomitake-san... and Takano-san... they died so miserably.`
`...Since those two had come to such an end... there's obviously no way 'it' would forgive only me...`
`"............"`
`Rika-chan cutely tilted her head in confusion... and waited for me to say something.`
`......If I were to admit to what happened that night, though... she might suddenly do a one-eighty, as if flipping a switch.`
`...That would make sense.`
`...Rika-chan... was the shrine maiden...`
`She was the least likely to forgive me for breaking the taboo, wasn't she?`
`Upon reflection, wouldn't telling her... be more terrifying than telling Mion or Ooishi-san...?`
`"............"`
`...Rika-chan could just give up and leave, couldn't she?`
`...She didn't.`
`...She only, she only... was quietly, quietly waiting... for me to say it myself.`
`...Say it, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...If you really are sorry... then you should say so.`
`Of course... it's normal to hesitate, given the crazy way Tomitake-san and Takano-san died.`
`...A pulping machine called 'chaos' was grinding up my brain...`
`...The juice wrung out of it... turned into big droplets of sweat... which began to fall...`
`"......Keiichi."`
`Rika-chan suddenly straightened up... trying to pat me on the head.`
`"......I don't really understand what you're worried about, Keiichi."`
`...I had nothing to say to that.`
` ...I lowered my head a little so that Rika-chan's palm could reach it.`
`...She petted me, kind of like one would a cat.`
`"......Do you know about the big storehouse a little way behind the shrine grounds?`
` It stores the implements we use for rituals."`
`...My breath literally stopped.`
`...Rika-chan, though, wasn't acting in a coercive way at all.`
`"......Apparently, on the night of a festival, a cat snuck into the storehouse."`
`"A... cat...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` A cat.`
` Meow, meow."`
`Rika-chan knew.`
`...She realized I was in fear.`
`...I could tell she was desperately trying to choose the right words so that she wouldn't scare me.`
`"...The cat always wanted to explore inside the storehouse, but...`
` ...I was mean to it, and never let it go inside.`
` ......So, on the night of the festival... `
`...the cat couldn't hold itself back any longer, and went inside."`
`The cat...`
`...It was clearly supposed to be Takano-san.`
`...Or, wait... was it... supposed to be me...?`
`"......Inside... there were actually lots of things that scared the cat."`
`Rika-chan made a cute gesture like a ghost was coming out to frighten me.`
`"......The cat was both terrified and amazed.`
` ......It ran away as fast as it could, clatter clatter, shiver shiver, meow meow. It was terrible."`
`"Th...... This cat... who are you saying it was?"`
`"......The cat is a cat.`
` Meow, meow."`
`Rika-chan still avoided saying it.`
`...The cat, though, was without a doubt... me.`
`"Rika-chan...`
` ...Please... tell me.`
` The cat... what should it do now?"`
`...Maybe it was a desperate question to ask.`
`...I had sort of admitted to being the cat.`
`"......The cat is just a cat, so it can just keep meowing and everything will be fine."`
`"E-Everything will be fine... that's stupid...!"`
`"......Shouldn't it just keep meowing?"`
`Geez... Rika-chan and I have put together an entire conversation... using 'cat' as a codeword.`
`I didn't say it directly... but...`
` I had already admitted it.`
`I didn't want to end up like those two.`
`...I didn't want to be... a sacrifice, like Shion said.`
`......That's what I thought... so I stubbornly remained silent.`
` ...But now... that's enough......`
`"...It can't just keep... meowing.`
` ...The dog saw the cat... making mischief and sneaking inside."`
`"......The dog."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...It was the dog.`
` ...It keeps coming to the cat... and trying to get it to say that it snuck inside."`
`"............"`
`After I said that, Rika-chan's expression clouded over.`
`...She was trying to hide it, but I'd already noticed her eyes darkening.`
`"...Rika-chan......"`
`The silence was frightening... so I spurred her on.`
` ...At that point, Rika-chan grinned.`
`"......It's all right.`
` I'll protect the cat."`
`...Huh?`
`...I thought for a moment... that I had misheard those words, so dependable they were.`
`"......The cat is really scared... but it really isn't all that bad.`
` I think all of the dogs are just misunderstanding."`
`"Eh...? It's not all that bad...?"`
`"......The cat is worrying too much.`
` I'll do something about it for sure."`
`Rika-chan will... do something about it...?`
`...I don't even know left from right at the moment... so Rika-chan didn't look all that dependable.`
`"...It might be hard, but I'll do my best.`
` Go for it, yay!"`
`She clenched her fist and stuck it in the air.`
`...Rika-chan said that the cat can just keep meowing.`
`...She said to leave it all to her.`
`...I-Is that... really all it took... to resolve this whole thing...?!`
`"Will you... really be all right... Rika-chan?"`
`"...If I don't do my best, then something bad could happen to the dogs, too."`
`.........I had no idea what Rika-chan was talking about anymore.`
`She had been talking to me under the assumption that I was aware of certain things.`
`...So at first, I understood her.`
`...Around the middle, though, I stopped understanding anything.`
`...However, one thing I did know was......`
` to not worry, and to leave it to her...`
`Rika-chan straightened up once again, patted me on the head, and smiled.`
`......I was so moved... by that reassuring feeling... that I couldn't help but start to cry...`
`"...I'm so... rry...`
` ...The cat... it really was... just a little bit of mischief.`
` ...It didn't think... any of this would......"`
`"......It's too much of a scaredy-cat.`
` ...That's why it should never have seen the storehouse."`
`...She was right.`
`...It was far too shocking for someone to see based on a little bit of interest alone...`
`...That's why they made it so difficult to look at in the first place, wasn't it...?`
`"Rika-chan.`
` ......What will happen... to the cat?`
` ...Two of the cats that snuck in... well... that night, they......"`
`...`
`...I'd heard Tomitake-san and Takano-san's deaths were being kept a secret.`
`...Rika-chan might not have known about it.`
`"............Tomitake and Takano?"`
`I gave a start at the sudden mention of actual names.`
` ...Though it's weird to do that at this point.`
`"......You should forget about them."`
`Thp...... my spine... froze again.`
`"Fo... Forget...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` It won't do you any good to remember those two, Keiichi.`
` ......The more you think about it, the scarier it will get.`
` So you should forget about them as soon as possible."`
`She said something so enormously terrifying... without letting the smile on her face waver at all.`
`"......I don't know where you heard about it from, but you should forget everything. Make your mind as clean as a scrubbed bathtub."`
`"F-Forget? ...Rika-chan... you know, don't you?!`
` You know... how those two died......!!!"`
`"......No matter how they died, it has nothing to do with you, Keiichi,"`
`Rika declared this in a flat voice.`
`...Nothing to do with me.`
`...So forget about it.`
`......The girl before me... she was innocent and lovable... and even seemed trustworthy... but suddenly she took on another dimension.`
`......Don't get involved with their deaths.`
` ......I'll help you, Keiichi.`
`Those two contradictory statements... twisted and distorted my image of the girl in front of me.`
`"...Wh-What about Shion...?`
` ...What'll... happen to her......?"`
`It might have been dangerous to mention Shion's name, but...`
`...I couldn't stop myself from asking.`
`...Rika-chan saw through everything anyway.`
` ...There was no way I was going to fool her or keep anything from her at this point...`
`"......The younger of the sister cats?`
` Meow, meow."`
`"Y-Yeah.`
` ...The little sister cat."`
`Rika-chan appeared to think upon this for a moment.`
`...It was hard for me to endure even this momentary silence.`
`"......The big sister cat is angry.`
` The little sister cat did something bad, so she's really mad."`
`"The big sister cat......"`
`...That could only mean Mion...`
` ...I recall being questioned by her yesterday.`
`"......Keiichi.`
` ...The big sister cat is not in a good mood at all.`
` ...I think we should leave her alone for a while."`
`Not in a good mood... Those words sent a shiver through me...`
`...Mion... was mad.`
`She was mad... that we entered the ritual storehouse...`
`"......Let's stop having club from now on."`
`"Huh?`
` ...Wh-Why...?!"`
`"......I think we should leave her alone."`
`Rika-chan ended her sentence with such force that I couldn't say anything in response.`
`...Hey, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...Don't disobey Rika-chan right now.`
`......She's the only one... who said she'll help me right now...`
`I'll leave things to her, just as she said to.`
`...I mean, she even said... that the cat should just keep meowing...`
`...I'll forget everything... like she said.`
` I'll leave everything to her.`
`......I'll forget everything—about Takano-san and Tomitake-san, and what I did that night...!`
`Just then, we heard a bell, far away, marking the end of our lunch break.`
`"I... guess we should go back to class..."`
`"......Keiichi."`
`As if she had noticed how miserable I was, about to leave everything to her and flee the scene... Rika-chan called out to stop me.`
`".........If the misunderstanding dog comes to try and bite the cat, please tell me, okay?"`
`The misunderstanding dog...`
`...She put it in such a cute-sounding way... but the true meaning behind those words... was an eerie one.`
`"......Who is... the misunderstanding dog?"`
`"......The dog that bit the mayor.`
` ......I don't know why it did that.`
` If it was going to bite anyone, it would have been the trickster cat first."`
`...The flow of blood in my body... felt like it completely stopped for a moment.`
`......Rika-chan had admitted it.`
`...The sacrifices of that terrible calamity...`
` ...she admitted that if they were to happen again, it would be Shion or I.`
`This... I didn't know what was true about the girl standing before me...`
`...My suspicion gave way to fear... and nearly began to change into anger...`
`Was she... a savior who would protect me...`
` ...or a stranger... trying to capture and kill me for the sake of a horrible tradition?`
` ...I had no idea what was true......`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` ......The cat is already scared... and I said something to scare it even more.`
` ...I'm really sorry."`
`Rika-chan bowed so quickly it looked like her head had been pulled downward.`
`...Still... she was right. I was cowering.`
` ...I could distinctly feel my body shaking violently.`
`So when Rika-chan reached her hand out to pat me on the head... I pulled away without thinking...`
`"............"`
`"...Ah... I'm s—..."`
`Rika-chan made a very sad face... but I just couldn't bring myself to put out my head for her again...`
`That day, Rika-chan said she wasn't feeling up for club activities, so she suggested we don't bother.`
`There's always vetoes when someone doesn't feel up to it.`
` ...Rena and the others seemed really disappointed...`
`...The big sister cat is not in a good mood.`
`I remembered Rika-chan's words... and quietly stole a glance at Mion's expression.`
`If I could forget the way she questioned me yesterday though, her behavior was the same as it always was...`
