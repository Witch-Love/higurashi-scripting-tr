`<The Human Sacrifice Ritual>`
`The sacrificial ritual was a simple drowning, involving plunging sacrifices into Onigafuchi Swamp, which was considered hallowed.`
`Of the rituals of Onigafuchi Village, this one was unique in that the sacrifice would sink slowly over the long course of three days and three nights.`
`I believe that it wasn't so much the killing of this sacrifice that was important,`
` but rather the symbolism of them sinking as the 'submerging' of Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`For that purpose, they must have had a passion for learning various methods for keeping the sacrifice from sinking too quicklyâ€”to force them to sink more slowly.`
`Unfortunately, as far as I can tell from the records, those methods were not recorded.`
`My thoughts are that they may have used logs or some similar material to create a raft,`
` then set up a scaffold on there, hung the sacrifice up with ropes, and let them sink little by little over time into the swamp.`
`However, if that were the case, it would not be strange if the 'ritual implements' used for such a ceremony were honored as holy and enshrined somewhere.`
