`<The Hidden Demon>`
`The inhabitants of Hinamizawa believe that the blood of demons flows in their veins. As such the character for 'demon,' 鬼, is treated as very sacred.`
`For example, usage of the character 鬼 in names is apparently a right reserved for only the leaders of the Kimiyoshi and Sonozaki families.`
`Case in point, we can see it in the current Sonozaki family leader's name—Oryou—is written with the character 魎.`
`This, and only this, is proof that she is a legitimate leader of the Sonozaki family.`
`In the same way, Mion Sonozaki, its successor,`
` contains 鬼 in her name, with 'Mi' being written as 魅.`
`It also goes for Oryou's daughter and Mion's mother, Akane, who did not succeed her. `
`It's known that before the disowning, Akane's name was actually written as 蒐, though it was changed afterwards to 茜 (still read as 'Akane').`
`Incidentally, it's thought that the first character the mayor Kiichirou's name, 喜, originally meant 'demon,' which can also be read as 'ki.'`
`It should be said that names using the character 鬼 aren't limited only to successors of the Sonozaki family.`
`You can even find it in the last names of the Three Families.`
`For example, the characters for 'Kimiyoshi,' 公由, are likely a split-up version of 鬼. If you write it in reverse and top to bottom, as 由公, it clearly resembles the character 鬼.`
`As for the Furude family (古手) who have been in the Shinto priesthood for generations—the word for 'fortune-teller' can be written, without interval characters, as 占手. `
`I think that with the addition of a demon's horn—the tick on the top of the character 鬼—the 占 became the 古 that is used in their name now.`
`In the case of the Sonozaki family, where Sonozaki is written 園崎, I can't find any reference to the character 鬼, perhaps because it's already ingrained into their first names.`
`They were the clan responsible for running the Watanagashi ceremony, so I think that instead, they included the contents of that ceremony into their last name.`
`The 'zaki' in 'Sonozaki' is a conjugation of the word for 'slice,' and the 'sono,' written as 園, probably contains the hidden meaning of 'human body,' as it is a complicated mess (organs) enclosed by four sides.`
`I think, in other words, that 'Sonozaki' comes from 'those who slice open the gut.'`
