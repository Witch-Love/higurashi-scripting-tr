`"Hey, Mion.`
` Here."`
`"Wha— What is it, Kei-chan...?"`
`I thrust the bento box she'd given me yesterday at her face.`
`"It's the bento box you gave me yesterday.`
` Thank you.`
` It was delicious."`
`"...Heeh......... ah..."`
`...Mion's face quickly flushed bright red.`
`...Hey, now, you were the one pretending to be Shion when you gave it to me...`
`You're gonna give it away if you get all red like that when you're being Mion...`
`At this rate, she might trip and fall right into her own grave, so I decided to help her out.`
`"Listen.`
` I was pretty hungry yesterday.`
` Out of the blue, Shion came all the way to my house and gave me some food in a bento box.`
` This is that box.`
` I made sure to wash it clean!"`
`"Ah, ...ahaha, r-right!`
` Shion's really considerate, huh~?!"`
`That was so transparent.`
`...Was Mion always this terrible at lying?`
`...Her expression was different than usual... but it looked strangely cute.`
`"So, w-what did you think?"`
`"...You two are like peas in a pod.`
` You're twins, right?`
` Obviously you'd look the same."`
`"Umm, ...not... not that... err..."`
`Mion looked kind of bewildered, like she was waiting for a specific answer.`
`...When she said "impression," maybe she didn't mean Shion, but the bento...?`
`"Oh, of course!`
` It was delicious."`
`"...Eh, ...ah... really?"`
`"I never lie about liking food.`
` If I say something's good, then it's objectively good!`
` You can feel free to give my recommendations to every single person you meet.`
` Tell Shion it was seriously great, all right?"`
`"Ah... o-okay!`
` Tell Shion, right?`
` I will!`
` I think she'll be happy...!`
` Ahahahahaha...!"`
`We're going along with Shion having given it to me, not Mion, aren't we?`
` Yet, her laugh... it came from deep down, and it sounded really happy.`
`...I guess she really can laugh nicely enough that just looking at her makes me feel better too.`
` A sarcastic remark made its way onto my tongue, but I swallowed it back.`
`As Mion went to put the bento box in her bag, she noticed a clattering noise.`
`"...Kei-chan, there's something inside.`
` Huh?`
` ............Wow..."`
`Gah... She opened it...?!`
`The thing inside was a little embarrassing, so I wish she hadn't opened it here.`
`Panicking, I hid it with my hands!`
`"Umm... well!`
` This is, well, my mother told me to put them in as thanks!`
` I didn't come up with it or anything!`
` Don't get the wrong idea!!"`
`"...It's so pretty...`
` Candy..."`
`There was a handful of candies, neatly wrapped in paper, inside the sparkly-clean bento box.`
`...When I was cleaning the box out yesterday in the sink, Mom came over and interrogated me, and I fessed up as to who had given me the food.`
`Then she told me that something like this called for a display of gratitude.`
` ...I didn't want to, because it was embarrassing, so I argued that it wouldn't be like me to do that...`
`"...Well... that's what happened.`
` ...I mean... urgh..."`
`I was so embarrassed it felt like fire might shoot out of my face.`
`...Mion laughing the whole thing off like she usually did would be fine... but for some reason, she was staring at the candy in the box with fascination.`
`"...Th-Thank you."`
`"D-Don't thank me.`
` Thank my mom—she put them in there!`
` B-B-Besides, you're not the one I need to be thanking, right, Mion!?`
` Those are for Shion, okay!?"`
`"...Ah... right.`
` You're right...`
` ...Okay.`
` I'll be sure to tell Shion!`
` I just know she'll be happy."`
`Mion, looking a little downtrodden, put the lid back on the box.`
` ...Seemed like I ended up saying something a little mean at the end.`
`"Mii-chan, you look sort of cozy today.`
` Did something happen?`
` Did it?"`
`"...Perhaps she's caught a fever?`
` The red in her face is probably due to the increased body temperature.`
` ......Hey, Rika.`
` Why are you petting my head?"`
`"......Satoko, I'm sure you'll be able to catch fevers soon enough."`
`...*pet* *pet*`
