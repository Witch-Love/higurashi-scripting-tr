`*rabble* *rabble* *rabble*...`
`"Hey! Are you worn out already?`
` Tomorrow's the real thing!`
` We're gonna be partying until morning, until the very end of it all, got it!?"`
`"Got it!`
` I'll give it everything I've got!"`
`"Wa-ha-ha!`
` All right, then! Youth is the greatest!"`
`"Good work, everyone!`
` Tomorrow is Watanagashi at last.`
` Let's get some shut-eye in and save our energy for tomorrow night!"`
`Tomorrow was finally Watanagashi.`
`Festivals are split into two groups: those who enjoy them, and those who support them.`
`The former only need prepare their minds, but the latter needs not only that, but also painstakingly crafted plans and preliminary arrangements.`
`While the general majority attending goes about enjoying the festival without a care in the world, we'll be strained the whole way through.`
` ...Why?`
`"You sure as hell know why!`
` Because the beer after everything's over is the best damn beer you'll ever have."`
`"Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`At times like these, it's best to have energetic, physically fit people!`
`It wouldn't be worth it if you didn't do your best until the end, enjoying it the whole way!`
`"Oh, he's here...!"`
`Ooishi-san came in.`
` Everyone hurried to stand up.`
`"Hello, everyone. Excellent work out there.`
` Ah, you can be at ease."`
`"""Thank you, sir!!"""`
`Not even my seniors, who usually talk big about themselves, can hold a candle to Ooishi-san.`
`We all bow as if we were one of those cheering squads of old.`
`Kuraudo Ooishi.`
`A detective just waiting to retireâ€”one who doesn't pay much mind to rules and regulations, and doesn't do too much in the way of real work.`
`He looks like a rotten old man with a penchant for dirty jokes.`
` My seniors, though, tell me he was a real fighter in his younger days, and that he may or may not have quite a heroic legend trailing behind him...`
`...Anyway.`
` He surely had much more dignity and presence in the room than the section chief who came in with him.`
`"Everyone, I really, really thank you for your hard work on the preparations for the festival tomorrow."`
`Everyone present stands upright and lends their ear to the chief's directions.`
`"We're on heavy alert for any thrill-seeking criminals expecting another incident like last year.`
` I need all of you to focus your energy as much as possible in your mission to prevent any crimes from happening."`
`"""Yes, sir!"""`
`"Of course, it would be best if nothing happened.`
` ...However, everyone.`
` Please assume that an incident will, in fact, occur. `
`Prevention is number one, but it probably won't be enough.`
` This year, too, someone will die, and someone will disappear.`
` There's really no doubt about it.`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`Everyone, apart from the section chief, smiled painfully.`
`"Ooishi-san... that won't do!`
` We need to be more serious about this..."`
`"The important part isn't to get past the night of the festival.`
` ...It's to be able to quickly, swiftly, and aggressively pursue whatever does happen tomorrow night. `
`"""Yeaaaaahhh!!!"""`
