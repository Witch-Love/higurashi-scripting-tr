`<Watanagashi>`
`The rite of Watanagashi is performed during a village festival every June even now, but reading back to its origin turns up a seriously sanguine ceremony.`
`Originally, Watanagashi would happen at certain intervals, and after receiving Oyashiro-sama's trust, they chose a sacrifice. `
`Then, the entire village would kidnap (demon away) the person and ceremonially dissect and devour them in a feast.`
`(The rules that determined the intervals are shrouded in mystery.`
` This is because the ceremonies occurred extremely irregularly. `
`There's a theory that it was determined based on astrological fortune-telling, but it isn't too convincing.)`
`The residents of ancient Onigafuchi Village firmly believed that they were half-man, half-demon transcendents, and that they were more valuable than humans wereâ€”and they forced people within and without to accept that.`
`Perhaps the act of kidnapping and eating people was done to prove that they were higher up on the food chain.`
`This is just a hypothesis, but maybe the rite of Watanagashi was a political event for the purpose of being an outlet for (or outright diverting the attention of) the villagers of the isolated Onigafuchi Village, `
`in case any of their complaints or dissatisfactions grew serious.`
`If that was the main reason these ceremonies were held, then it's easy to explain how erratic they were.`
