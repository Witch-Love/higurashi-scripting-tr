`"Excuse me for the late call...`
` I'm Kimiyoshiâ€”is this the head of the household?`
` ......Yes!`
` No, not at all. Thank you very much for that.`
` Yes.`
` .........Well, you see.`
` ...I do apologize for calling at this hour, `
`but I was wondering if our old man was visiting you at the moment.`
` ......You've got that right!`
` Yes!`
` Once again,`
` I'm very sorry for calling so late.`
` Goodbye."`
`Click.`
`"So?`
` No good?"`
`"I'm not sure what to do...`
` He may be passionate about it, but he always at least gives us a call!"`
`"You called everyone he plays Go with, didn't you?"`
`Briiiiiing...!!`
`"Hello!`
` This is Kimiyoshi."`
`"This is Sonozaki.`
` How did it go?`
` Have you found the mayor?"`
`"Oh, Mion-chan.`
` ...I called everyone I could think of, but I came up with nothing.`
` We can't find him...`
` What do I do...?!`
` Where could he be idling about...?"`
`"I put a word in with a bunch of people who might have had an idea...`
` but nobody did."`
`"............"`
`"I asked Nana about it, and she said we should get the men of the village together to search for him."`
`"A-At this hour...?`
` I mean, it's not like he's definitely gone missing..."`
`"Watanagashi just happened.`
` She thinks we should be a little more cautious.`
` If we still can't find him, then we'll notify the police tomorrow morning. `
`Whether or not we find him, though, we should refrain from making any false accusations."`
`"...Oryou-san said that?"`
`"Yes.`
` If you can't trust her without hearing her voice, then I can put her on for you."`
`"N-No, that's fine...!`
` I understand.`
` We'll get the men together and search.`
` If we still can't find him... then we will notify the police in the morning."`
`"She'll leave it to you to organize the men.`
` I'll be there as well, as Nana's representative."`
`"Th-Thank you.`
` I'll get everyone together immediately..."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll talk to you later."`
