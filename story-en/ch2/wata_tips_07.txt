`<Oyashiro-sama's Curse>`
`In the ancient Onigafuchi Village, the anger of Oyashiro-sama (his curse) was feared above all.`
`However, it is seldom stated anywhere what eventually happens, and what sort of divine judgement (curse) befalls them when Oyashiro-sama is angry.`
`From various reports...`
` "All hell will break loose"`
` "Demons will come flooding out"`
` "The miasma from Hell will flood outward and kill every villager, letting not a single one escape" `
`The ones evoking images of the village being annihilated stand out the most.`
`These terrifying ideas of divine punishment are in alignment with many other religious beliefs regarding the apocalypse (Hell), and it's easy to imagine that they are just ways of convincing people to obey the teachings in order to prevent such an end.`
`The conditions for inciting Oyashiro-sama's wrath are likely the same as the taboos in Onigafuchi Village.`
`I believe that when an act was performed that violates one of these taboos, Oyashiro-sama was termed 'angry,'`
` and in order to quell his anger, they would perform the aforementioned sacrificial ritual.`
