`"I heard they're planning on selling Angel Mort figures.`
` We'll have to pay heed at the next event...!!"`
`"Speaking of which, that major figure maker decided to bring out the line!`
` We must confirm the release date ...!"`
`"'The problem is, there's too many variations to bulk buy them ... `
`If it were just a normal set of family restaurant uniforms, there'd only be around ten types... But, including the secret set with different poses that are planned, there's 100 or so!!"`
`"Someone, trade with me when I get a double~â˜†`
` It's my duty as a fan to complete the collection right away!`
` No, this is destiny between us~!!"`
`"Shut up, you greasy fatass!`
` Get out of here before I get angry."`
` Yonder waitress was the one who wet mine pants!`
`"...There's nothing I can say to that."`
`"Mew too.`
` Not a nyamber one, but a nyamber two!`
` I need to cash out meow!"`
`"Where's da toilet!?`
` I found eeeet!`
` Urine for it now!!!"`
`"*pant pant*... Women's toilets are the best~~!!!!!"`
`"That would be purrfect!!`
` Purrease, purrease!!`
` At this rate it'll end up becoming group enema purray~~!!"`
`"Listen up, you tubs of lard!!`
` You know what happens if you even set one foot outside this door, right!?"`
`"If you walked around with it, then you'd be treated like a weirdo starting tomorrow. Definitely!"`
`"This time we'll have her spill everything on my pants, and have her give an especially thorough wipey-wipey!!"`
