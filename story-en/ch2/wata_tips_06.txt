`"...Stop saying 'it's been a while'!`
` We've seen each other every day up until yesterday, haven't we?"`
`"...Whatever.`
` If you say so, we'll go with that."`
`Someone from Shion's house came to get me in a station wagon.`
`I had initially refused, but Shion insisted, and so both my bicycle and I ended up stuffed in the car.`
`Said car was currently driving across the single bumpy road leading to Hinamizawa.`
`For goodness sake... Shion was at Mion's level at least, or maybe an even better actorâ€”either way, no matter what questions I pressed her with, she'd slip out of them like an eel.`
`"Still... you two look so alike.`
` If you tied your hair back like Mion does, would you look exactly like her?"`
`"Who knows?`
` That's probably what would happen.`
` We're identical twins, through and through.`
` In the past, we could just change our clothes and no one would be the wiser. `
`I remember we'd swap places at every opportunity and fooled a whole lot of people. Ahahaha!"`
`The middle-aged driver wearing a black suit heaved a heavy sigh, like he were a butler.`
`"What's wrong, Kasai?`
` That was a pretty deep sigh."`
`"Excuse me.`
` ...I was just thinking that you haven't changed."`
`You could see many years of hardship on the man's face through the rear-view mirror.`
`"Anyway, Kei-chan, your house was around here, right?`
` Kasai doesn't know much about Hinamizawa aside from the road that goes to the Sonozaki main house. `
`If you leave it to him, he'll take you all the way to Yagouchi."`
`"I-I don't want that!`
` ...Excuse me, could you stop at the narrow road at the next right?`
` I'll walk from there."`
`He stopped the car at the desired place.`
`The driver, Kasai-san, got my bike out of the trunk for me.`
`"Ah... Sorry about that.`
` Thank you very much for showing me home today..."`
`"Was it Kei-san?`
` Your name, that is."`
`"Eh? Ah, yes."`
`"...You must be having various difficulties, but I believe she will grow tired soon, so please endure things until then."`
`He gave me a deep, deep look of sympathy.`
`...This guy has definitely been dealing with the Sonozaki sisters ever since they were little kids.`
`"However, like Mion-san, she's a kind person at heart."`
`"...So that means she'll be as much of a bother as Mion, right?"`
`The man's face froze in a smile, his reply lost.`
` ...Hey, back me up here.`
`"Bye, Kei-chan! We'll see each other again soon.`
` Say hi to my sister for me, too.`
` Maybe I'll start going to Hinamizawa tomorrow?"`
`"Don't you dare.`
` If you transferred in, I'll transfer out to a school in Okinomiya."`
`"Wow, that was really mean, Kei-chan...!"`
`A short beep of the horn.`
` The man gave a little wave to me from the driver's seat.`
`Then, the car withdrew into the dark night roads, leaving dust in its wake...`
`.........Man... this entire day made no sense.`
`...I ran into Mion while I was with Shion, and the former's expression, like a pigeon shot with a pellet gun, had finally begun to make a strong impression on me.`
