`"Just why ya arrestin' us?!!"`
`"Bullshit!!`
` Leggo a me!!!"`
`"Kuma-chan, you can let go of their arms now.`
` Here, please, sit down."`
`The three people rubbed their arms painfully - Kumagai-kun and the others must have been squeezing them pretty tightly.`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha...`
` Don't get me wrong.`
` I haven't arrested you or anything.`
` Kuma-chan.`
` Go get me something cold from the fridge, please.`
` Would you like your barley with foam or without?`
` Hmm?"`
`They plunked down onto the reception sofa, and despite not yelling anymore, they still had dangerous expressions.`
` ...Mmm, what I'd give to be young again.`
`"I'll drink even if you don't, you know.`
` Excuse me for helping myself.`
` ......Mmmm~~~!!!`
` Beer is best when you drink it on the job~!"`
`As he downed the beer with glee, the three people exchanged glances, then finally reached out for their cans.`
`...They hadn't stopped being cautiousâ€”it was more like they didn't see a reason to refuse.`
`They each opened their cans and began to drink the contents.`
`"Where did you guys come from?`
` You're not from around here.`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`They looked at each other again, suspicious of whether they should tell him.`
`"Are you all college students?`
` Friends on a trip?`
` You were probably travelling on bikes or something.`
` Sounds like fun I wish I was having!"`
`"............"`
`"You don't live close by, do you?`
` Where did you come from?`
` Osaka, perhaps?"`
`"Whassit matter to ya?"`
`"Now, now, there's no use trying to intimidate me.`
` You would have all been in a lot of trouble if I'd left you there, right?"`
`They seemed to recall the thrilling event from earlier.`
`...While they could understand getting surrounded by students, or a gang, or something along those lines...`
`...They would never have been surrounded by locals both young and old, both men and women before.`
`It was easy to imagine how scared they must have been.`
`"If you were from here, the people of Hinamizawa wouldn't have done anything to you, no matter what you had done wrong.`
` ......They're all special. `
`Not in the sense of parents not wanting to get involved in their children's fights.`
` ...If one person gets bullied, the village will come out in full force.`
` That's not just an idle threat, you know."`
`They couldn't argue against that.`
`...They themselves had been surrounded. They'd seen it with their own eyes. There was no doubt about it.`
`"Around these parts...`
` If the people of Hinamizawa give you a glare like that, you'll simply get demoned away and no one will hear from you again.`
` You'll suddenly disappear without a trace. `
`...Do you all have families that would get the police to search for you if you went missing?`
` If not, then that's bad.`
` You'll vanish, and that'll be the end of it.`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`Even then, we got there soon enough that nothing happened. If we'd been late, things could have taken a turn for the worse.`
`If they'd been forced into an alleyway... these young men wouldn't be sitting on a couch right now, they might be lying on an autopsy table.`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu! Well, probably not...`
`Anyway.`
` ...Perhaps they'd be a little more cooperative if we'd found them as corpses.`
`"...How did you all get to Okinomiya?`
` By train?`
` By bike?"`
`"...Bike."`
`"That's not good.`
` They're still parked there, aren't they?`
` If you go waltzing in to get them back, they really might gang up on you."`
`"......Hellsat?`
` We'll take'em all!"`
`Calm down, calm down...`
`Why are young people these days so quick with the shouting...?`
`"You don't want any more trouble, right?`
` Tell me the bike license plate numbers.`
` I'll bring them here for you.`
` ...Kuma-chan, please borrow the loading truck we use for traffic disasters."`
`"Got it!"`
`"Iss, iss fine...!`
` We'll get them ourselves!"`
`"Do you really want to get surrounded again?`
` The police may not be fast enough to save you this time."`
`"............"`
`"It's fine, innit!?`
` If we's surrounded, they gonna get knocked down!"`
`"Hey.`
` You three...`
` You're drinking the barley with foam, right?`
` ...Try turning your engines on.`
` I'll arrest you on the spot for drunk driving."`
`"...You... that's fuckin' dirty...!!"`
`"Your tax dollars will be put to good use in bringing all your bikes back here.`
` Quit complaining and tell me the god damn license plate numbers, you pieces of shit."`
`The three were hesitant to tell him the numbers.`
`...They were mumbling something along the lines of not remembering them since they'd just bought the bikes.`
`......Well, that's what I thought. Hah~~...`
`"Kuma-chan.`
` Go with the truck and bring the bikes back.`
` Get the tough-looking red YAMAHA, the one with the broken right tail light,`
` and the white one that had the packing tape stuck to the seat.`
` It's those ones. `
`They belong to you, right?"`
`They didn't answer. Those must be the right ones.`
`"Ooishi-san, the truck is here, so I'll get going."`
`"Yes, yes, please do.`
` Wait, Kuma-chan, hold on. One more thing."`
`"What's up?"`
`"Look up the numbers.`
` You don't want to bring the wrong ones back."`
`The three people's faces changed color.`
`...They made themselves very easy to understand.`
`"Let's take it easy here until your bikes get back.`
` There's more beer, you know.`
` We have some snacks, too.`
` Want to watch TV?`
` There's probably nothing on, though."`
`"Nah, thanks, we's leavin'.`
` Don't wanna hang here forever!"`
`Suddenly, there were five or six huge officers surrounding them.`
`Their clearly overpowering stares nailed them to the sofa.`
`"...Wha... What?!!`
` Whaddid we do?!!"`
`Going on a trip by stealing motorcycles, huh?`
` ...Students these days have too much time on their hands.`
