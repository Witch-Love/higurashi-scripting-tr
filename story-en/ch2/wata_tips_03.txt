`Now, at last, we come to the blazing-hot third day.`
`To Angel Mort, a super-famous restaurant and the envy of all enthusiasts, despite being located in the remote Shishibone City of ×× Prefecture.`
`Why, exactly, do the most famous stores avoid the centers of human habitation?`
` It can only be because it is a trial given to us by the God of War Photography.`
`It's famous locally for having the best desserts in town, but that matters not to us!`
`If you want expensive desserts, then you can just go to a [censored] place or something!`
`We aim not for sweet treats... but for sweet uniforms!!`
`The fragrant aroma of sweat wafts from these obligatory waitress uniforms, creating no less than a public torture device!`
`How can their bashful flirtation be on par with all the other restaurants with cute uniforms all across the country!?`
`War Photography Hunter...`
` Awaaaay!!`
`★The smoking areas are the real super positions? Aim for your chance at them with the tenacity of an octopus!`
`Ryuu: "Yesterday, I failed to get seating.`
`Today, I will aim for the ultimate, golden seat—the corner box in the smoking area!`
`Otaku are overwhelmingly non-smokers.`
` So I'll procure a spot in the smoking area and set up camp there."`
`As expected of Ryuu, the Hunter.`
`He's saying his victory was decided the moment he chose his seat.`
`In actuality, Ryuu used the same tactic during the grand opening of Akihabara's ×××××× and succeeded in getting the best seats in the house.`
`Back then, he also went early in the afternoon, just after the lunch rush, and not only did he find his target seat empty, he also obtained it with ease.`
`By utilizing tricks such as ordering a little at a time, he effectively increased the number of opportunities for engagement, carefully scoping out his chance for a picture...`
`But... as if cursed by that* from the day before, the God of War Photography did not smile upon him!!`
`After suffering successive, firm defeats until 3 PM, he finds no chances coming his way.`
`And after 4 PM, a man began to take his orders—it looks as though he has been seen through...`
`It is the rule of a Hunter to withdraw with grace once marked......`
`Ryuu: "My aim was perfect... but the fork technique I used at 2:30 seemed to have backfired.`
`...Maybe they were wary, since I sat in a booth and left my bag on the floor...`
`Perhaps the hidden camera in a bag trick is already old hat...`
`If there were 2-digit EGs involved for sticking here half the day, I'd have a high encounter rate.`
` ...I am mortified."`
`Even so, he still got a few pieces of gold.`
`...As to be expected from the Hunter.`
`He attained this nice angle, despite lamenting his failure.`
` He is an artisan.`
`More surprising, though, is that this Uniform Conquest Across Japan has yielded not a single arrested person!`
`What an amazing start for the hunter who brags about having been to approximately half of the total prefectural police stations in the country!`
`* 'That' thing the day before.`
`The day before, our Hunter took on the Shrine Maiden Cuisine ×× in Nagoya.`
`His Hunter spirit showed through too zealously, and as soon as he entered the store, he was seen through, placed in a booth, and waited on by the head priest.`
`Despite waiting half a day, the much-anticipated shrine maidens appeared only at the time of his first order...!`
`A seriously huge blunder for a Hunter!!`
`Now then, here we have the giveaway of the Hunter's original photographs that always receive such high praise!!`
`We'll present one passionate reader with three all-you-can-eat low-angle pictures of the Angel Mort uniforms, chosen by the Hunter himself!!`
`With such blazing hot pictures, you, too, can become a war photographer today!!`
