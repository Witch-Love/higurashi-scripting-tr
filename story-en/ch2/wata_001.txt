`The chirping of birds served as my alarm clock.`
`...Huh?`
`...Wasn't today Sunday?`
`Wasn't it basically my style to stay up late on Saturday and sleep through the morning on Sunday?`
`...Why was I waking up at this disgustingly wholesome hour?`
` ...Back to sleep, back to sleep...`
`"Keiichi~, are you awake~!?`
` You have a phone call!"`
`At that moment, the sound of my mother calling me from downstairs finally registered.`
`Phone call!?`
`I sprang up out of bed abruptly and stampeded noisily down the stairs.`
`"He's awake, I'll put him on right now," my mother informed the person on the other end of the line.`
`"Hello?`
` It's me.`
` Who might this be~?"`
`"Ahahahah!`
` Mornin', Keiichi-kun.`
` You're such a sleepy-head. Such a sleepy-head!"`
`"Oh, Rena! What's up, calling so early in the morning...?"`
`"Ah, I don't think it's so early... it's the middle of the day, you know?"`
`It was 11 o'clock.`
`...I guess you could loosely consider that 'the middle of the day.'`
`"So, what's up?"`
`"Hold on a second!`
` I'll put Mii-chan on now."`
`"Ohayou, Kei-cha~n!`
` If I were to say it in English, that'd be 'good morning.'"`
`"While we're at it, why don't you try saying it in Chinese, German, and Russian as well?"`
`"Ni hao Kei-chan.`
` Guten Morgen Kei-chan.`
` Russian!?`
` Do svidaniya...`
` .........`
` How the hell should I know!?!?"`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Well, whatever.`
` This stupid conversation has woken me up."`
`"Ahahaha!`
` That's good to hear.`
` ...So, Kei-chan, you free right now?`
` If you're good, then we've got everybody."`
`Everybody?`
` Did she mean all the club members?`
`"That's right.`
` You might be thinking: 'Every day always ends in heated competition, but at least I can spend my day off peacefully'...`
` You're too naive, Kei-chan!!"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` The aim of our club is to find the best solution for every situation.`
` In other words, we don't care if it's the weekend."`
`"Oooh!`
` It looks like Kei-chan has come to understand our club!`
` So, how about it? Can you come?"`
`I had absolutely nothing planned that day.`
`If I were to refuse Club President Mion's invitation, what other fun ways to pass the time would I have?`
`"...It's not like I planned on doing anything.`
` And if I said no, you'd probably just declare me the loser by default and force a penalty game on me anyways!"`
`"If you understand that much, then you can't refuse, right~?`
` If you're okay with it, then meet at the usual place at one o'clock!`
` We're going into town, so bring your bike, okay?"`
`Club activities in town?`
`...Well, we could do them anywhere.`
`Besides, since it was a new venue, there was no way this wasn't going to be intense!`
`"I'm holding a pretty big grudge from that narrow loss a couple days ago!!`
` I'll say it right now, I'm not going to lose!"`
`A couple of days ago was Friday's club activities...`
` That uncompromising poker match!`
`It was a fight to the death.`
`Nobody held back.`
`Nobody could tell who was in the lead or who was last until all the points were tallied.`
`In the end, I won by only 1 chip.`
`Mion came in second.`
`"Dammit!!`
` To think, if I hadn't squandered that one chip!!!"`
`Mion lamented thus, perhaps moreso that than the fact she lost the match.`
`Mion doesn't lose.`
`That's why Mion only whined when she let the champion's throne slip through her fingers.`
`That's why she was more frustrated than anybody over a close loss.`
`...So, did she mean for today to be a grudge match?!`
`"Bring it on!!`
` Just like last time, I'll shut you down and make you play that penalty game!`
` Make sure you play in a way that you won't regret it when you lose!!"`
`"Hehehe!`
` Wouldn't have it any other way!`
` It'll make it all the more better when I crush you!!!"`
`After that, we exchanged jeers for a bit before hanging up the phone.`
`As I headed back upstairs hastily to get the key to my bike, I bumped into my mother as she was carrying a futon down.`
`"Oh, Keiichi, you seem like you're in a good mood. Heading out?"`
`"Something like that!`
` I'm going into town to play with everybody."`
`"Take care.`
` Watch out for traffic~!`
` Be back before dinner~!"`
`"Yeah, yeah! I'll be back by then!"`
`After unlocking the chain from my bike in the garage, I reveled a bit in the resistance the slightly stiff pedal gave as I pushed on it.`
`Alright, let's go!`
`I set off on my bike, cutting through the refreshing morning air.`
`"Keiichi-ku~n!`
` You're late, you're late!"`
`"Ah, sorry to keep you waiting!`
` Huh? Where are Satoko and Rika-chan?"`
`"Rather than meeting up with them here, it's a lot quicker to just meet up in town."`
`Oh, I see.`
` If I remember correctly, Satoko and Rika-chan's houses were on the other side past the school.`
`"Oh yeah. What's up with doing club activities in town?`
` It can't be that everybody's going to put on masks and rob banks all day, is it?"`
`"I wouldn't mind doing that.`
` Even then, I wouldn't lose to you~!"`
`"You see, Mii-chan always tells me the routes and schedules of the armored bank cars.`
` ...I wonder why? I wonder why!"`
`What?!`
`I spun around with a serious look on my face and looked at Mion.`
` ...Well, it certainly seemed possible that Mion was capable of doing that.`
`"...Seriously Mion?"`
`"Re... RenaaaAAaaa!!`
` What are you sayiiiiiinng!!!!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` Sorry, Mii-chan! Sorry! Ahahahaha!"`
`The two of them joked around.`
`...That bright laughter was the best match for a beautiful day like today.`
`"Hey, you two!`
` Satoko and Rika-chan are waiting for us, aren't they?`
` Let's stop fooling around and get going!"`
`Around and around, fooling about like two fluttering butterflies... I earnestly wished I could just keep watching them like this.`
`But, the five of us together would be absolutely more fun!`
`"That's right! Well then, let's go!"`
`"The goal is to plunder one billion!`
` Once we split the loot, everybody scram!!!"`
`""Yeaaaaah!!""`
`The three of us on our bikes headed over the gently sloping hill towards town.`
`Accelerating hard, we crested the hill.`
`The view expanded as Okinomiya Station came into sight.`
`I occasionally come to the station here.`
`Considering the amount of effort it takes to get here though, it was quite a hassle.`
`That's why I didn't know much about the area around the station, or Okinomiya itself for that matter.`
`The street we were headed down today was of course unfamiliar to me as well.`
`Going through the railway crossing, we headed past the south end of the station.`
`"...This is the first time I've been this way."`
`"Around here, there's lots of things like arcades and toy stores.`
` Mii-chan knows a lot about it!"`
`"So there's an arcade.`
` I used to go to one pretty often!`
` My gamer's blood roils within me!"`
`"Always going to an arcade? Kei-chan, you're quite the delinquent~!`
` Next time we're here, I'll show you where it is.`
` It's a good one—there's quite a few machines."`
`It seemed like the town of Okinomiya was Mion's stomping grounds.`
`If I asked her, she could tell me a lot of things about it.`
`Eventually, we came across a store with quite a few bikes parked in front of it.`
`Was this the arcade?`
` No... it was a smaller shop.`
`Looking at the window display, it seemed like your everyday toy shop.`
`...But, for almost ten kids to be filing in and out of the store... they were doing almost too well for themselves!`
`"Could it be... that store is having some sort of event today?"`
`"Exactly!`
` Top prize is 50,000 yen!!!"`
`"Fi-Fifty thousand!?!?`
` What the heck is that!!`
` That's the GNP of the People's Republic of Keiichi 5 times over!!!"`
`Two cute figures messing about the front of the store noticed us and waved their hands.`
`"Hello, everybody~!!`
` We've been waiting for you~!!"`
`"...Good morning."`
`"Hey!`
` Morning, Rika-chan!`
` Satoko, we'll settle this before the cops get here!`
` The goal is to plunder 1 billion!!"`
`"Huh?? ...Keiichi-san, I have no idea what you're talking about."`
`"Are we late? Did we keep you two waiting?"`
`"...We finished early today, so we've been waiting a while."`
`"I'm sorry about that.`
` Kei-chan here was taking his sweet time!"`
`"...Well if it was Keiichi's fault, it couldn't be helped."`
`Saying that, Rika-chan stretched up and began patting Mion's head. Hey, wait a minute...`
` ...Are you solving everything by making me the bad guy?!`
`"Of course!`
` Who else but Keiichi-san could fill this important role?`
` Ooohoho!"`
`"I don't like being cast like that.`
` If you think that this'll solve everything, you're sorely mistaken!"`
`...I was feeling slightly irritated, so I began to repeatedly smack Satoko on the head.`
`*smack smack smack smack smack smack...!!!*`
`"...It's such a shame that Keiichi's bullying you."`
`"Satoko's crying! She's crying!!`
` I'm taking her hoooome~~!!!`
` Your big sis here will take care of the bad guy, okay?"`
`WHAAAAAAAAAAM!!!!`
`Rena ecstatically wiped the tears (which were probably fake...) from Satoko's face, while Rika-chan gently patted mine as I lay sprawled on the ground.`
`...Yes, this is fine.`
`"Hmmm, yup.`
` ...This is the way things are supposed to be solved..."`
`"...Although, I think we should find a new punchline before you start losing teeth."`
`Well then, upsy-daisy.`
`In any case, the greeting for today went well!`
`Inside the toy shop, there were about 10 boys around the same age as me.`
`Apparently they all knew Mion, and finding out that she had arrived, they greeted her with jeers a few at a time.`
`"Mii-chan is a regular at this toy shop.`
` So she has a lot of friends!"`
`"A regular at a toy shop... what's up with that?"`
`"Hey, Keiichi-san, take a look back here!"`
`Following Satoko's prompting I took a look... there were chairs lined up at tables, almost like some sort of birthday party.`
`...I realized it immediately.`
`"I-It couldn't be... this is the venue for today's club activities!?"`
`"Surprised, Kei-chan?`
` I'm good friends with the owner here!`
` He sometimes lets me hold game tournaments to expand his customer base."`
`Expand his customer base... I see.`
` ...Meaning, all the boys livening up the place... were participants!?`
`"That's right.`
` Normally it's just us five, but today we're gonna play with lots and lots of people!"`
`Rena was innocently happy about being able to play with so many people, but my expression grew noticeably stern.`
`"...Keiichi-san, I know exactly what you're thinking."`
`"Oh?`
` Well then why don't you try saying it?`
` Together, okay? One, two..."`
`"These are all enemies!!"`
` Satoko's voice and mine blended together in harmony.`
`We looked over at the participants.`
`...After all, the top prize was 50,000 yen!`
` My eyes lit up like a flame.`
`"Hey, Kei-chan.`
` It looks like today will be fun."`
`"...Well.`
` No matter how many more rivals I have, the goal is still the same!!"`
`"Rivals?`
` ...*sigh*, Kei-chan.`
` ...Do you think a whale keeps track of all the krill it eats~?"`
`She said that in an unpleasant voice, laughing with the aggressive glint in her eyes reserved solely for club activities.`
`...Dammit, Mion...`
`...She's as serious as she can get today!!`
`"I'm not the only one who's serious.`
` ...Take a look at Rika-chan."`
`Mion pointed.`
`Looking at where her finger directed me...`
`"...What the heck is that?"`
`Rika-chan was using 'those kinds of traits' to soften up the group with an almost excessive pleasantness...!`
`"...I'm also going to do my best.`
` Go for it, yaaay♪"`
`"""Go for it, yaaaaay♪"""`
`Completely emasculated, the group joined Rika-chan in a cheer.`
`The inside of the store had been consumed by "The World of Rika-chan"!!`
`...Damn. ...She's already chomping at the bit!`
`"I-It seems like today's going to be fun!`
` I'm going to do my best~!`
` Hau~~~~!!"`
`It seemed that Rena was also unusually fired up by the large crowd.`
`Hopping about and running around, she had entered entirely into Kyute Mode.`
`..In Rena's case, the real fun starts when her Tension Gauge fills up!`
`Her happy-go-lucky attitude belied the fact that this was the state in which she was the most threatening...`
`Mion was making small-talk with some of the regular customers she was acquainted with. It was like business as usual with her.`
`Of course, if anybody thought that Mion looked ordinary, they were not qualified to be in our club.`
`The shadow beneath her feet was exuding killer instinct, rising up like a chill wind!`
`"...Damn it, Mion... throwing away her honor and humanity like that... she's serious."`
`"Keiichi-san, didn't you know...?`
` ...The 50,000 yen prize is from Mion-san's own pockets."`
`Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!?!?!?`
`She was putting out the 50,000 yen... all by herseeeelf?!`
`At that moment, a dark miasma that warped Mion's surroundings began to appear!!`
`"...Hm?`
` What is it, Kei-chan?`
` Is there...`
` something on my face...?`
` Hehehe!!"`
`Eep!! ...A shiver crept up my spine.`
`...That Mion... cornering herself like that... she was pulling out the demon lurking within her!!!`
`F-Fine with me..!`
` Damn it... my knees are shaking like crazy...!`
`Before I realized it, the store had filled up with even more people.`
`However, the looks in their eyes weren't confrontational.`
`They were looks of expectation and curiosity.`
`They were the eyes of onlookers who were wondering what kind of match was going to occur, and who was going to win.`
`"Hehe... you couldn't ask for a better stage than this.`
` This is getting interesting..."`
`"K-K-Keiichi-kun!`
` L-L-L-Let's do our best, okay?`
` Do our best!!`
` Hau~!!!"`
`Rena was already fully charged.`
`Mortal laws and common sense held no power before the might of Rena in her Kyute Mode!`
`I definitely didn't want to fight her, if possible.`
`"""Rika-chan, do your best!!`
` We're all cheering you on~~!!!"""`
`"......Okay.`
` I'll do my best~♪."`
`Rika-chan, who was exuding way too much charm no matter how you looked at it, had already won over most of the onlookers to her side.`
`Nonchalantly avoiding things had always been Rika-chan's creed, but... for her to be blatantly laying out her machinations like this, something was definitely strange!!`
`...Like Rena, she was somebody who I didn't want to fight if I could help it.`
`"Of course, the one you don't want to fight the most is Mion-san."`
`"...I've been lucky to even leave alive more than a few times at the end of club activities, but...`
` I don't think there was a day that even came close to being this dangerous."`
`"Mion-san seems to have developed quite the grudge after losing that poker match a few days back, you know?"`
`"It seems that way.`
` ...In other words, today is just an elaborate stage for her revenge!"`
`Almost as though she were psychic, Mion turned towards us.`
`Her eyes silently conveyed the message: "You guys just figured that out now?!"`
`It wasn't just Mion; both Rena and Rika-chan were more pumped up than they'd ever been.`
`...Yeah.`
` ...One's gonna pop up today.`
` ...Without a doubt, there'll be casualties!!`
`"It seems that somehow Keiichi-san and I are the only ones left.`
`...What do you think?`
` Should we not have our match during the opening round?"`
`"Might as well.`
` I need to warm up before I can really kick it into gear—"`
`My spinal column shuddered like it had been struck by a bolt of lightning, and like a pillar of ice was being jammed into it, began to freeze.`
`I could almost see the flames backlighting Satoko with their intensity.`
`Even then... while Satoko was displaying a normal smile...`
` It was cold and inhuman, almost as if it were a plastic mask!`
`"...Heh!`
` You must really want to eliminate me in the opening round.`
` You can't hide that murderous intent."`
`"Oh, that's too bad...`
` You're being uncharacteristically cautious today, Keiichi-san.`
` Ohoho!"`
`Without a doubt, it was a trap.`
`...I don't know what she had up her sleeve, but if I fought with Satoko during the opening round, my loss would be more certain than if I went against Mion!!!`
`A pitch-black miasma permeated the inside of the store...`
`Did they all want to win that 50,000 yen prize that much?!`
`No, that's not right.`
`...The only ones competing for the prize money were the casual participants.`
`I was different.`
`I had mistaken this as just a way to fool around on a normal Sunday.`
`It didn't matter when it was, or where it was, or who our opponents were.`
`...In our club, the goal is always the very top of the mountain!!!`
`An intense flame that no strong winds could extinguish, hot enough to melt any steel, began to burn inside me...`
`The fuse had been lit on this unprecedentedly intense club battle!!`
`It was then that the owner of the store told Mion in a lackadaisical voice that it was about time to begin.`
`Mion began with the formalities, standing in for the owner, and explained the rules of today's tournament.`
`You're only playing to win!`
`There is no second or third place.`
` ...That's the same rule as our club.`
`There were 15 people participating.`
` We were to split up into 5 groups via a draw, and each group would have one winner.`
`Each winner in the first stage would advance to the next in order to compete in the final.`
`"Now, as for how each group will compete:`
` each table can decide to play whatever they want.`
` As long as the game is here in the shop, anything goes!"`
`Already in Club Mode Defcon 1, I didn't let the small gap in the rules go unnoticed.`
`"Mion, can I ask a question?`
` Won't everybody push to play a game they're good at, and not be able to agree on which one?"`
`"...Hau.`
` That's right.`
` If we can't decide, we can't start."`
`The spectators also nodded along.`
`It was only natural.`
` There wasn't anybody who would simply cede to their opponent's suggestion!`
`"I'd prefer if you were all good sports and manage to come to a decision on your own, but if it comes to a stalemate, should we have the store's owner decide for you?"`
`It was an event at a toy store, after all.`
` You'd expect the owner to referee.`
`After that, Mion's rundown continued. It ended with the rule that any losing participants would have to buy the game they lost at; a rather nice proposition for the store.`
`First... we used a draw to split into 5 groups.`
`Everybody lined up single file, and began to draw tickets that the shop owner had prepared.`
`It was my turn.`
`Alright, time to draw.`
` ...No matter who I was up against... I'd crush 'em!!!`
`At that moment, Mion began to laugh with a hawkish gleam in her eye.`
`"Of course, I'm sure you already know... but club members will have a separate penalty game than the casual participants."`
`"...Heh.`
` I thought as much.`
` What's the gist of it?"`
`"The winner gets to give the losers one order each."`
`Contrary to how simple it sounded...`
` It was a terrifying eventuality, the subject of which no one could predict...`
`Damn you, Mion...`
` Was she... really planning on parading me around Hinamizawa in cat ears and a banana hammock with a tail attached or something?!`
`The look on Mion's face told me... she wasn't going to let me off that easy.`
`On top of that... this time, it wasn't just the person who finished last who'd have to submit to the penalty game.`
`"The losers get one order each... in other words, even if you don't finish last, you still have to do a penalty game."`
`"That'd be the case."`
`"What about if there's no winner?`
` Like, if all the club members drop out midway through?"`
`"...Ahahahaha!!`
` Kei-chan, are you all right in the head~?"`
`"Wh-whaaaaAAt?!"`
`The look in Mion's eye became that of a lion baring its fangs!`
`"How, exactly, are the elite members of our club going to lose to some mewling newborns?`
` ...Kei-chan.`
` Don't embarrass me by getting eliminated in the first round."`
`Even so, I didn't feel threatened!!`
` The more into it my opponent was... the stronger I would become!!`
`"You just wait and see.`
` I won't just sit here and be bullied by you, Mion. I'll show you!!!"`
`"We shall meet...`
` In the finals!!!!!!"`
`The results of the draw were... enough to make you cry conspiracy.`
`All the members of the club were nicely divvied up amongst the 5 tables.`
`...How did this happen when the draw was that random?!`
`The thought that I was already caught in Mion's puppet-strings made me feel uneasy.`
`That was fine, though.`
`...I'll crush all your petty tricks!!`
`Now, where were my opponents?`
`Everybody was headed to the table corresponding to the number on their ticket.`
`The competition at my table was... these two, huh.`
` They look younger than me.`
` ......Huh?`
`"...Aren't you two classmates of mine?"`
`"Oh, hi.`
` I'm Tomita.`
` This is Okamura."`
`Okamura-kun greeted me by nodding his head.`
`So my opening round was to be against my juniors from school.`
`...Just saying, but it seemed like a pretty easy match-up.`
` Lucky!`
` Time to destroy them without mercy!!!!`
`"Alright then, everybody!!`
` Please decide on your games and start!"`
`With Mion's declaration, the inside of the store suddenly became lively.`
`Everybody was yelling their favorite games at each other, trying to gain an advantage before they started.`
`Even my two classmates, who seemed taciturn at first glance, began to fiercely insist on their own games as soon as the signal was given.`
` Of course I would kick those suggestions aside!`
`There was absolutely no reason to pick a game your opponent was good at!`
`"Sorry, they're all games I don't know.`
` Could you pick something a little more well-known?"`
`Of course, they didn't agree to the games I suggested either.`
` I could only smirk bitterly.`
`Naturally, after 5 minutes, this table still couldn't agree on a game.`
`Obeying the rules, we asked the store owner to decide on a game.`
`Clearing his throat, the shop owner brought over a board game from the back of the store.`
`...Quite the vintage we have here.`
`Come to think of it... if you lose, you have to buy this game.`
`...That damned shop owner, was he using this competition to get rid of all the games he couldn't sell?`
`"I know this one.`
` You guys do too, right?`
` Spin the wheel, and head to the goal.`
` Whoever has the most money after we liquidate our assets is the winner."`
`The two nodded in agreement, and finally the game was underway.`
`At that time, I already had a feeling of impending crisis.`
`...I wouldn't realize why until the game progressed a bit.`
`"1, 2, 3, 4.`
` Celebrate the birth of your child.`
` Receive $5000 from everybody.`
` ...Sorry!"`
`Okay! I've built a bit of a lead!!`
`"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.`
` Bonus.`
` Receive $100,000 from the bank."`
`Wha?!`
` The tables were turned in an instant?!`
`"1, 2, 3.`
` Proceed to the corporate ladder course."`
`Whoa, that's a good route!!!`
`...It seemed like only my piece was landing on the 'steady' spaces?!`
`I had doubts as to why Mion didn't bring out board games for club activities, but that reason was laid bare to me before my eyes.`
`That's right.`
`I had only realized it now.`
`...This game... was completely based on luck!!!`
`What could I possibly do to make sure I ended up in first place at the end!?!?`
`The ultimate outcome of this game... was decided in a place beyond human hands!!!`
`...How were the other club members doing? My eyes naturally wandered off to the other tables.`
`Mion's table was... what?`
`They weren't doing anything?`
`Had they still not decided on a game...?`
`This naive idea... existed to distract me from the most frightening possibility...`
`Mion was lounging about, leisurely holding some juice she bought from the vending machine outside in one hand.`
`When our eyes met she gave me a look of ease.`
`It couldn't be... she'd already finished?!?!`
` What game was it?!`
` That easily?!`
`It was probably too late to be concerned with that at this point.`
`Only 5 minutes since we started, and her two opponents were already beyond recourse.`
` ...They were sitting there, slumped over in disappointment.`
`Muttering to themselves, trying to figure out where they went wrong... for that, they'd find no answer.`
`Was there any reason for their defeat other than 'they sat at the same table as Mion'?!`
`Then, what about Rena's table?!`
` The spectators were causing quite a commotion!`
`It looked like their game was karuta.`
` The shop owner was apparently the one reading out the cards.`
`Rena tended to dawdle along and space out a lot...`
`...Wouldn't she have a hard time with this game?`
`"Then, I'll read it out~.`
` ...'The dog gets tired on a walk'~."`
`BAAAAAAM!!!!`
`At the same instant the shop owner began sounding out the words, the card in question disappeared off the face of the table—no, the face of the Earth!!!`
` ...Impossible! Where did it go?!`
`...It was against Rena's cheek.`
` She was rubbing it there.`
`"Hau~~~~!`
` Sho kyuuuute~~!!`
` I'm taking it home~~~!!!"`
`Looking at the card Rena was rubbing against her cheek... it was some anime-themed version of karuta, with rather cute moe illustrations decorating the cards.`
`Basically, it was a picture of a pretty dog-girl with a slightly large chest, panting and half in tears as she was being pulled along on a chain.`
`...With those types of pictures, even I could play with godlike speed...`
`Of all people to play that game, it had to be Rena!!`
` It was entirely possible that her fingertips were on the verge of breaking the sound barrier!!`
`"...It's over."`
`Mion smiled coolly. Seeing no further reason to keep watching, she turned back.`
`"Sho kyute sho kyute!!!`
` Even if Rena wins, I'll still buy these cards~~!!!`
` I~'m ta~king them ho~me~~~ hau~!!!!"`
`After that, the second the card started being read out,`
` BAAAAAM!`
` BAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!`
` Such decisive sounds echoed...`
`Well then, how about Satoko... oh, she was playing a rather orthodox game.`
` Concentration.`
`Judging from the distressed look on Satoko's face... it seemed that she was struggling somehow.`
`One of the main characteristics of Concentration is that the pace of the game speeds up as it goes on.`
`As the number of cards to memorize decreases, it becomes easier to match several pairs in a row.`
`It wouldn't be exaggeration to say that the first person to take over the flow of the match can run away as the winner.`
`The cards still in play had decreased.`
`...If you memorized the cards that had been turned over before, you should have a good chance to sweep the table at this point...`
`Satoko probably knew the positions of all the remaining cards.`
` ...However, her turn came a little too late!`
` If her opponent followed up... the match would be decided!!`
`"Houjou... Sorry, but I'm also aiming for the prize money.`
` Don't hate me for this!"`
`This guy... did he have the locations of the remaining cards memorized?!`
`He was completely certain of his victory.`
` The tension on his face relaxed.`
`"Hmph.`
` ...It's over."`
`I whispered that in a bored manner as I turned my attention back to my own game.`
`I spun the wheel.`
` 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...`
`"Wh-Whaaat?!?!`
` No way!!`
` The ace of hearts should have been here!!"`
`There was a commotion at Satoko's table as the shout rang out.`
`The other two at my table turned around in surprise.`
`I didn't.`
` After all, there really wasn't anything to be surprised about.`
`The onlookers were confounded, most of them certain that the ace of hearts should have been there.`
`"There's no way... I must be seeing things... It must have been because I was excited..."`
` ...So assured in his victory, the distress over his defeat ran deep.`
`Hmph.`
` ...That's how it is.`
`If his opponent wasn't Satoko, then the ace of hearts certainly would have been there.`
`What a fool.`
`...When you're up against Satoko, you can't let your guard down for a moment until the battle is over!!!`
`"Hmm? Keiichi-san, you still haven't finished your match?`
` You have no sense for these things."`
`With a refined tone of voice reserved for only winners, Satoko called out to me.`
`For the casual observer, it must have looked like she only eked out a victory.`
`From my point of view, however... she was only playing around.`
`The roles of winner and loser had already been decided. It was nothing more than child's play!`
`The laughable part about it was that her opponent didn't know his role had already been assigned.`
`"Nice work there.`
` ...Setting up a farce of a trap with the ace of hearts."`
`"My opponent only walked into one of my traps.`
` Even then, one was more than enough."`
`Satoko was a trapper.`
`Her true talent was never having one misfire.`
`...Setting off only one trap was more than enough?`
` ...Hmph!! Ain't that cool!!!`
`The fact that the other club members were winning one after another with their own brand of play only added to my impatience at my own lack of progress...`
`Oh right, how was Rika-chan doing?!`
`How was our club's sly little fox doing?`
` ...`
` What the heck is that?`
`Over in that corner, the mood at that table was decidedly different from the others.`
`The game at Rika-chan's table was... you know that battery-powered fishing game?`
`The one where the fish opened and closed their mouths as they rotated on the platform, and you used a magnetic fishing rod to pick them up? That old thing.`
`...It seemed they planned on competing by seeing who could catch the most fish, but...`
`...It had become an atmosphere you could hardly call competitive.`
`"....Wow♪ I caught one~."`
`"You're so good!`
` Rika-chan, you're good at this~!"`
` "Oh my, she caught another one~.`
` Rika-chan is really good at this☆"`
`...I knew that Rika-chan had already charmed her opponents, along with the onlookers, before the matches had even begun, but...`
` ...brilliantly played.`
`That corner had become an informal meeting of the Rika Furude Fan Club!!`
`"It's Rika-chan's total victory!`
` Total victory!`
` Rika-chan's good at fishing, isn't she~!"`
`"What Rika-chan is trolling for probably isn't fish..."`
`Hearing that, she glanced over my way briefly.`
`"This is my way of getting serious."`
` ...That's what I heard.`
`"This is a masterful technique that only Rika is allowed— only Rika can do!!"`
`...Yeah!`
` ...A masterful technique!!!!`
`"Maebara-san, it's your turn."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` Guess it is.`
` 1, 2.`
` ...Fined for tax evasion.`
` Pay $50,000 dollars..."`
`In contrast... my game... what an unseemly situation this was!!`
`Noticing the uneasiness creeping across my face, my companions came to see how I was doing.`
`"Huh... Keiichi-kun, could it be you're struggling? You're struggling?"`
`"Okamura.`
` Right now, how much money do you have?"`
`Okamura, who had wrung lots of money out of the elite course, began to count through a stack of white 100,000 dollar bills.`
`"Uh...about 980,000, I guess."`
`"...How much money do you have, Tomita?"`
`"Ah, I have... $880,000.`
` I'm still close enough to turn this around!"`
`Those two, it looked like they would easily surpass a million dollars!!`
`"Well? Kei-chan, how much do you have...?"`
`Mion's tone of voice was grim from the get-go.`
` ...It was her disappointment and disgust as club president.`
`"I... It can't be helped!!`
` There's no strategy involved other than spinning the wheel in this game!!!`
`How am I supposed to cheat?`
` Tell those two to close their eyes and count to a hundred while I rig the wheel?!`
` ...You know there's no way I can do that!!"`
`Rika-chan gently pet my head.`
` ...Still, she wasn't too happy.`
`"...How pathetic.`
` At one point I thought you'd be a worthy adversary.`
` I've been utterly disillusioned."`
`"Don't give up, Keiichi-kun!`
` There has to be some way to make a comeback!`
` Do your best!`
` Right 'till the end!!"`
`...Like I said... how am I supposed to make a comeback with this game relying entirely on luck!?!?`
` Right?! Mion?!`
`...Mion's face, however, was almost unbelievably indifferent... like she was watching something completely unexciting.`
`...She then turned her back without saying a word.`
`"H-`
` Hey, Mi—"`
`It was a pathetic voice that irked even myself...`
`"...I'm disappointed.`
` Everybody was serious about this, but Kei-chan was the only one who wasn't."`
`"Wh-What do you mean by serious?!?!`
` Are you telling me to control the spinner through sheer force of will?!?!`
` How can I do that?!?!"`
`"...If you were serious about it, you would have settled this game 10 seconds from when you started."`
`"Mi-Mii-chan! You don't have to get so angry!`
` Wait!"`
`Mion, in a bad mood, cast me aside and disappeared into the depths of the shop.`
`...Maybe it was because it had become an awkward situation, but the spectators dispersed from around my table...`
`Damn it!! Are you saying I'm not serious about this?!`
`Are you saying if I were serious, I would have settled this game of chance in 10 seconds?!?!`
` If I were serious... If I were serious...!!!!`
`Everybody was praying for my victory.`
` They believed in me!!`
` ...Did I betray their expectations?!?!`
`Was it because... I wasn't serious?!`
`....Ugh...!!!!`
`"Umm... should we continue the game...?"`
`The two of them were timidly trying to resume play.`
`...I didn't respond to that.`
`The table sunk into silence.`
`"Maebara-kun... should I take that to mean you're giving up?"`
`The owner, thinking I was forfeiting, started to announce the cancellation of the game...`
` At that moment!!!`
`...The demon inside me let loose a howl... and awakened.`
`I get it now, Mion...`
`...What it means for me to be serious...`
` I'll show yoooooooooooooooooou!!!!`
`BAMPH!!`
`I clamped my hands on their shoulders, speaking in a low voice after pulling them closer.`
`"Tomita-kun.`
` Okamura-kun.`
` Let's make a deal.`
` Let me win."`
`The two of them, not immediately understanding what I had just said or the meaning behind it, were momentarily confused.`
`"Hey, Maebara-san, no violence!`
` Let's settle this game properly!!"`
`"Just listen to what I have to say.`
` ...What is it you guys want?`
` The 50,000 yen prize?"`
`"Well, of course.`
` Winning that kind of money is a once in a lifetime opportunity!"`
`"Even supposing you win.`
` What are you going to do with that money?`
` How are you going to enjoy it?"`
`...The two of them considered it briefly.`
`"Buy a new game, or something...?`
` Snacks?`
` ...Maybe some juice..."`
`"Hehehe... that's petty.`
` So petty.`
` Are you guys stupid? Hehehe!!!"`
`"Th-Then, how will you enjoy it if you win, Maebara-san?"`
`"Me?`
` That's the point.`
` Just shut up and listen to what I have to say."`
`We club members have a penalty game separate from the casual participants.`
`If we lose, we have to obey a single command from the winner.`
`...From another point of view, the winner earns the prize of being able to order the other club members around!`
`"First of all, Tomita-kun.`
` You like Satoko, right?`
` Don't deny it!!!`
` Next, Okamura-kun.`
` You like Rika, right?`
` Don't turn red!!!!"`
`I drew the two of them—red-faced and conscious of whether anybody else heard what I just said—even closer.`
`"Lolis!`
` Moe!`
` What men covet,`
` what men dream about!!`
` It's like an unreachable Garden of Eden!!`
` Even then, you'd still aim for it, wouldn't you?!`
`That's because our passionate souls scream for moe!!!!"`
`That sensitive age where you couldn't say you liked the girl you liked...`
` Understanding that gave me all the more power!!!`
`"Tomita-kun, if I win...`
` I'll make Satoko wear a collar and be your little sister for a day."`
`*Pshh*. A red fountain spewed from both of Tomita-kun's nostrils.`
`"Also, Okamura-kun.`
` I'll put cat ears on Rika-chan and let you take her out for a walk on a leash."`
`*Pshh*. Blood erupted from the vein in Okamura-kun's forehead.`
`""Th-th-that... That... Uhhhhhhhhhh......!!!!!""`
`"Don't be shy!!!`
` Just pretend I forced you to go along with me!!`
`You two are simply sacrifices to Maebara-senpai's whims!!`
` You can pretend to be against it!!`
` I understand!!! I know everything that your hearts desire!!!!"`
`...Then, I suddenly lowered the tone of my voice.`
`"...My school life was very bleak.`
` I know with my very body how foolish it is to waste such an important time in your lives.`
`...So... to you, my juniors...`
` I don't want you to live your lives like that!!!!!`
`Be honest with yourselves!!!`
` Chase your dreams!!`
` Fulfill them!!!`
` I'll fulfill them for you!!!`
` I wiiiiilllllll!!!!"`
`It was this moment that the values of men bridged generations.`
`""Ma-Maebara-saaaaAAAaaaaaAAAaan!!!!!!""`
`Did I ever have a mentor who ever spoke my mind for me so strongly?`
` Never!!`
` There was no way there was!!!`
`That's because in a man's lifetime, he'll only have three fateful encounters.`
` That valuable first time... was being experienced right this moment with these two!!!!`
`"It's fine then?`
` Let's do it.`
` ...One, two, three."`
`"""Game oveeeer!"""`
`It was such an assertive declaration of the game's ending that everybody in the store turned and looked.`
`It had been less than 3 minutes since I was on the verge of forfeit and all the spectators were certain of my loss.`
`"Ke-Keiichi-san... what happened!?`
` Who won...?!"`
`"It was my complete victory."`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaAY!?`
` Exactly how did you overcome that situation?!"`
`"There's no need to explain what happened.`
` It was a gentleman's agreement.`
` Right, guys?"`
`""YESSIR!!!!""`
`The two of them, stifling tears of gratitude, answered strongly from the bottom of their hearts.`
`Exactly what kind of miracle occurred here during those three minutes the spectators all looked away from my utter disadvantage?!?!`
`"Y-you did it! You did it, Keiichi-kun!! Yaaaaaay!!!"`
`The spectators were puzzled at how I was able to so quickly overcome that hopeless situation!`
`"...That guy, is he able to control the spinner wheel with his eyes or something?!"`
`"It's a miracle!"`
`"What devilry is this!!"`
`"He's in cahoots with *that* Mion, you know!?"`
`"There's no doubt he had some strange trick up his sleeve!!"`
`I looked at the crowd, who couldn't help but be excited, out of the corner of my eye. Now fully awakened and in battle mode, I let out a derisive laugh.`
`"...So this is what it means for me to be serious.`
` Mion."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...You took your sweet time."`
`Baring our fangs at each other, we laughed together in a most unsightly fashion!!`
`"With this... all the club members have cleared the first round, then!!"`
`"Which means, this time... it's a match against everybody! A match!"`
`"...I've already decided what I'm going to buy with the prize money."`
`"That's only natural~!`
` Right~?"`
`Satoko and Rena smiled (sneered?) at each other.`
`Hmph, these guys...`
`Do they really think they can win against Keiichi Maebara when he gets serious?!?!`
`"Mion.`
` ...That was a mistake.`
` ...You shouldn't have offered me 'advice' just now..."`
`"...Hehehe... what a mewling newborn you are.`
` You're a million light years too early to think you can win against me."`
`"Mion.`
` ...Light years are a measure of distance."`
`...Oh, she's embarrassed, she's embarrassed.`
`"What are we doing, Mii-chan?`
` How are the five of us going to face off?`
` How?"`
`"Well now.`
` ...Hehehe.`
` We have such a splendid line-up.`
` It would be a waste to rush things."`
`"...Mii is saying something complicated again."`
`"!? ...It couldn't be... why you—!!"`
`Mion's hair flowed elegantly—almost like a cape—as she turned her back to the table.`
`"As for today's contest: I, Club President Mion Sonozaki, will reserve judgment for now.`
` The method and time are yet undecided.`
` ...The more spectators, the better. `
`It should be in front of everybody from Hinamizawa and Okinomiya.`
`...By then, we'll know the best way to finally settle things."`
`"A-Are you running away from this!?!?`
` This is too unfair, even for you, Mion-san!"`
`"Hehehe... you newborn!!`
` Do you still not realize what has happened?"`
`The combative aura billowing out of Mion's body formed a barrier, stopping Satoko's advance!!`
`"We'll meet again.`
` Prepare yourself for your inevitable defeat."`
`With a shrill laugh, Mion left the store...`
`After a moment of silence, the crowd erupted into cheers!!`
`"When will they resume the contest?!"`
`"Mion's serious!"`
`"The other members did great too!"`
`"That new guy, Maebara... He's got some strange power...!!!"`
`"He turned the tables in an instant!!"`
`""Maebara-saaaaaan!!!`
` You've got to win!!!""`
`"Yeah!!`
` I'll dunk someone like Mion headfirst into the River Styx for ya!!!"`
`The part of the crowd that had apparently overheard the covenant between Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun, and myself erupted into a cheer again!!`
`Mion's going to win anyways!!`
` She's the Undefeated Empress!`
` I'm betting on Mion!!`
`No, it's going to be Rena with that ungodly speed!!`
`Satoko the Trap Artist!!`
`Rika the Siren!!`
`It may be a long shot, but it'll be Maebara!!!`
`However, right now, I had no ear for those cheerful voices.`
`Setting the stage for this huge match and then running away like that... I wasn't going to forgive Mion!!!`
`Outside of the store, Mion was getting on her bike as the shop owner was seeing her off.`
`"Don't run away, Mion!!`
` If you're the club president, don't run!!`
` Fight meee!!!"`
`"Oh, sorry, Kei-chan.`
` Right now,`
` I've got to get to my part-time job☆."`
`Huh!?`
` Like you would see in a sketch-comedy show, my legs slipped in opposite directions until I was doing the splits.`
`"Yeah.`
` While you were playing your game, Mii-chan received a phone call.`
` ...It's too bad."`
`"It was just getting good, too... not our lucky day.`
` ...They're getting crushed at the sale over at my Uncle's store. They don't have enough people to work the registers, so he called me for help."`
`"When you say your uncle... does he manage a supermarket or something?"`
`"It's just a small store,`
` buuuut!`
`...Whenever you put stuff on special, all the housewives swarm in like locusts. Don't they have any common sense?! `
`Even though they don't have enough staff, they're selling a carton of eggs for 10 yen, limit one per customer!!!"`
`I was a little surprised.`
`You would never think that this was the club president exuding such a dark aura inside the store just a short time ago.`
`It was the usual Mion right now, almost exasperatingly so.`
`My shoulders slumped.`
`...That's right.`
` Club mode was over now...`
`But... It was really heated today.`
` It really was fun!`
`Damn Mion, she really knows how to fire people up!`
`"Me too!`
` I got so fired up my head started to tingle!`
` Especially Kei-chan!`
` That was scary!!`
` I thought he was going to eat me alive there!"`
`"It's work, so I guess there's nothing you can do... but it really is too bad!"`
`"I really want to continue this some other time!`
` Any time is good~!"`
`"...How about we do it at the Watanagashi Festival?"`
`"The Cotton Drifting Five-Demon Fire Fight!`
` ...That's right.`
` I'll think about it."`
`Right now, what were Rika-chan and Mion talking about?`
`...Watanagashi Festival?`
` Cotton Drifting Five Demon... what??`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` I love it when things turn out all over-the-top and manga-like.`
` It'd be nice if we could have another thrilling club activity like this soon!"`
`She laughed with a smile that made you feel refreshed just looking at it.`
`At that moment, the shop owner came out carrying a paper bag.`
` ...I wonder what it is.`
` Is he giving it to us?`
`"Thank you, everybody, for today.`
` Thanks to you, the event went really well~!`
` It's not much, but here's a little something for you guys~."`
`"Hey, Uncle Yoshirou!`
` Isn't there a little something for me, too?"`
`"My my my!!`
` Quite an adorable one, is it not!?"`
`When Satoko and Rika-chan opened up the bag, there were cute little stuffed animals inside.`
`"Wow!!`
` They're so... kyute~...!!`
` Can I take them home?!`
` I really can...!?"`
`"Which means, there's something for me, too?`
` ......Oh.`
` I got a pretty adorable one."`
`It was a stuffed toy wearing a beautiful dress.  One you'd use to play house.`
`Rena's eyes were glued to my stuffed doll!`
`...Satoko was the same, and...`
` Rika-chan too...!?`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Kei-chan got the one that fits him the least!"`
`"...How do I say this... I could say it's pretty or cute...`
` ...Well, I guess it's cute and pretty... I can admit, it's adorable... but a doll with changeable clothes is... eh..."`
`...Mion didn't have to go that far.`
` This wasn't something a guy like me should be carrying around.`
`Mion was the only one who hadn't received a present, so I thought about giving it to her. However, after briefly considering, I gave it to Rena instead.`
`"Huh!?!?`
` You're giving it to me!?`
` To Rena!?`
` Thank you~~~!!!!!"`
`"Just protecting myself.`
` ...If I didn't give it to Rena, then walking the streets at night would be scary."`
`"Ahahaha!!`
` No doubt! No doubt!"`
`"I thought about giving it to Mion, but it just didn't feel right!"`
`"Heh heh heh, you know it!`
` I sometimes wonder why I wasn't born a boy."`
`"It's better that you're a girl.`
` If you were a boy, I would have killed you already!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!!`
` You should kill me while you still can!`
` If you don't, Kei-chan, you might not live to regret it.`
` Ahahahahaha!!"`
`Mion laughed after saying such an ominous line.`
`Everybody laughed heartily along with her.`
`"Ask God to make you a boy in your next life!`
` I'll also have Him make me a boy."`
`"Then together, the two of us will start with taking over the country as a warm-up!`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"Mion-chan, if you don't get going soon..."`
` the shop owner told her meekly.`
`The lot of us looked like we were having a lot of fun, so it must have been hard to put a wet blanket on things.`
`"Later then.`
` Today was really fun.`
` I'll see you later guys.`
` Tomorrow, at school~!"`
`"Don't be late for work!"`
`Everybody waved their hands and watched as Mion left.`
`...Before I knew it, the sun was already setting, and the breeze carried a hint of chill.`
`"Should we play for a bit more in town?`
` Or should we go home?"`
`"...The road gets scary when it's dark."`
`"Then, I guess it's time to leave.`
` We certainly caused a ruckus today!"`
`"We sure did! ...Okay!`
` Let's go home."`
`The wind blew gently, as if to cool down those of us flushed with enthusiasm.`
`The road back to Hinamizawa was long, but I didn't really mind.`
`"Oh, that's right!`
` Rena-san, you achieved an overwhelming victory, didn't you?"`
`"When Rena gets like that, I'm sorry to say it, but there's no winning against her!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` It was because the cards were so kyute.`
` See!`
` I bought them☆. Hau~~!"`
`"Rika was the same as usual.`
` When it comes to boys, it's like taking candy from a baby!"`
`"...It was an easy win."`
`"...How much was calculated and how much was natural...?`
` I get scared when I think about how Rika will turn out in the future..."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Satoko-chan was amazing too!`
` The way it ended was really exciting!"`
`"It wasn't the sort of game where I should be complimented.`
` Ohohoho!"`
`"...Keiichi, you also showed your fangs at the end there."`
`"Hm?`
` Well, I guess!`
` I'm the type of guy who's strongest when he's cornered!"`
`"...Tomita-san and the others seemed to be cheering you on really hard... what was that about?"`
`"...He made some sort of promise with Tomita and Okamura.`
` ...It's probably a secret."`
`"A... a secret... a secret...`
` ... Hau~~... I wonder what it is, I wonder!"`
`"....Ah, sometimes, for a man, there are times we can only understand one another by fighting...!`
` Wahahahaha!!"`
`Desperately laughing, I frantically tried to avoid the subject.`
`After that, everybody continued to praise each other for how they defeated their opponents, and reflected on how fun today was.`
`"Everybody look!!`
` The sunset is beautiful~!!!"`
`Satoko, getting even more excited, pointed. Waiting where her finger indicated was an immense sunset, casting even longer shadows of us on our bikes.`
`The cries of the higurashi were gentle and very comforting...`
