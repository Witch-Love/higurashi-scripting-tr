`...I saw a ceiling I was familiar with.`
`...Though I was groggy from sleep, I did notice that I was in my futon, like I was every morning.`
`I looked at my clock... and despite having turned in so late last night, I had awoken at precisely the same moment I always did.`
`I'm so low on sleep... but I guess you really can get up at the same time every day.`
`...The secrets of the human body never ceased to amaze me...`
`If I went back to sleep like this, I would definitely not be waking up again.`
` ...I spurred myself on and slipped out of my futon.`
`Mom asked me about last night at breakfast.`
`......Apparently we, too, had gotten a call asking if we knew where Rika-chan and Satoko were, and Mom vaguely understood that something serious was happening.`
`"...So then, you were out late last night with all your friends looking for them?"`
`"............Until about three, I think.`
` .........Yeah."`
`"...Did you find them?`
` Rika-chan and Satoko-chan, I mean."`
`Crunch.`
`......I wearily bit into my toast.`
` ...It really didn't have any taste.`
`Just then, we heard the chime go ding-dong.`
`I looked up at the clock and saw that it was about five minutes past my regular meeting time with Rena.`
` ...It was her at the door.`
`"...Good morning.`
` ...Did you get any sleep? Did you?"`
`"...I think I slept for a few hours...`
` You could probably count them on a chicken's toes, though."`
`"Ahahahaha."`
`Rena seemed pretty sleep-deprived as well.`
` ...There was something missing from her usual spirit.`
`"...Are you... going to school?"`
`"Yeah...`
` ......I think it would be better that way."`
`She said, smiling, albeit stiffly.`
`...Rena was probably worrying her heart out about those two as well.`
`...Even so, she wanted to go to school.`
`"...If you stay home today, I think you'd just be worrying non-stop and sleeping.`
` ...I don't want that.`
` ...So let's go to school together."`
`".........All right.`
` Wait just a moment.`
` I'll get ready."`
`I was... just a little bit happy about Rena mustering that much consideration for me.`
`We went to the place where we'd usually meet up with Mion, but she was nowhere to be found.`
`...We were a little bit late today, so we thought she'd be waiting for us...`
`"...I guess Mii-chan couldn't wake up today, huh?"`
`"Ah... that's right.`
` ...For her, it wasn't just yesterday.`
` ...She was up all night looking for the mayor the night before last, too..."`
`We waited for a bit.`
` ...Time passed until it got to the point where it was okay for us to go on alone, and we exchanged glances.`
`"What do we do...?`
` Wait a little longer?"`
`At that point, my brain, which had finally been woken up by the morning air... recalled the ominous words Ooishi-san had left me with last night.`
`......The leaders of the Three Families were disappearing one after the other.`
` ...And next... it might be the Sonozaki's leader.`
`Could Mion have............ No, that couldn't be...`
`"......Let's go.`
` Let's let her sleep for today."`
`Rena gave me a pat on the back.`
`"...Mion...`
` ...She's still here, right?"`
`"Hm?`
` Did you say something?"`
`"Oh... nothing, just talking to myself.`
` ...Let's get moving."`
`The two of us headed to school by ourselves.`
`On the way, we saw a bunch of our classmates accompanied by their parents.`
`...It even looked like some of them were being taken to school by car.`
`Surprisingly, the principal was also standing watch at the school gate.`
` I'd never seen that before.`
`"Good morning."`
`"Good morning."`
`The principal was bowing to our classmates' guardians.`
` ...The wooden sword leaning next to him was a little ominous.`
`"Maebara-kun, good morning.`
` Ryuugu-kun, good morning."`
`"...G-Good morning."`
`"Your teacher has something important to say, so head straight to the classroom.`
` ...All right?"`
`Rena and I said nothing.`
`......The madness that only existed at night had finally crawled out into the sunlight...`
` ...That's what it felt like.`
`"Good morning everyone."`
`The hushed conversations that had been spreading for a while now all disappeared like an illusion the moment our teacher walked in the door.`
` ...Silence dominated the classroom.`
`The principal came in with our teacher as well.`
` ...This was clearly not a normal morning.`
`"...First, the principal has something important to tell everyone.`
` ...Go ahead, Mr. Principal."`
`The principal cleared his throat and approached the dais.`
`"......I'm sure some of you already know this."`
`...The classroom was dead silent.`
`...Everyone was staring at Rika-chan and Satoko's empty seats.`
`The principal briefly and simply declared... that Rika-chan and Satoko had gone missing.`
`...There wasn't a single person in the classroom who didn't already know.`
` ...There seemed to be many, however... who couldn't accept it as the truth.`
`It had been confirmed to them now by the principal's words.`
`...There were sobs throughout the classroom... and I heard a kid crying.`
`...They steadily spread throughout the whole room...`
`...The big-hearted principal wasn't able to keep his cool, either.`
`"Okay, everyone, pay attention!`
` From today on, your parents or guardians will be taking you to school.`
` For those of you whose parents can't do so, you'll be coming here in groups. `
`I made a handout, so read it carefully, and be sure to show it to your parents.`
` Understand?"`
`The teacher's voice was a little abrasive.`
`...Not even she could conceal the strain she felt from this unprecedented, abnormal situation...`
`They should have just cancelled school today.`
`However, Rena told me that the school was also like a nursery for the students whose parents both worked, so some of them wouldn't want school to be cancelled.`
`"Well then, let's begin the lesson.`
` ...Class president... she's absent, I see.`
` Then whoever is on day duty, let me hear it!"`
`"All rise!"`
`That feeling of wanting to maintain an everyday atmosphere, even if only in school, precisely because our lives had been messed up... was something that I agreed with at this point.`
`As for the teacher, who always had her lunch in the staff lounge, she ate in the classroom today.`
`......I had to laugh at her curry bento—which was just a rumor until now—but there was nobody to laugh with me.`
`Rena brought her chair and lunch over to my seat.`
`...Today... it was only the two of us.`
` ...The fact that we didn't need to drag any other desks over... was sad.`
`"...I'm sleepy."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I don't feel like sleeping anymore, though.`
` ...In fact, I'm jealous of the people that could sleep at a time like this. They've got nerves of steel."`
`"Ahahaha, you're right."`
`I was sleepy this morning... but my drowsiness had dissipated after coming to school and constantly feeling the incredible tension.`
`Rena's bento box didn't have its usual luster.`
`...That was to be expected.`
`Rena was up for a long time last night, too.`
`...She wouldn't have had time to make her lunch beforehand.`
` Since it's not like she would have gotten up early this morning...`
`"...Grab anything you want.`
` Go ahead, you can admit that my bento is better today."`
`"O-Okay... then I'll have some.`
` ...Wow, a chikuwa roll with perilla and cheese? That's interesting."`
`"Rena, yours might have ready-made food in it, but it's pretty good too."`
`...I realized the two of us were desperately trying to brighten the afternoon mood to its usual level as much as we could.`
`...I looked around the classroom... and it seemed like we were the only ones trying to do so, surrounded as we were by gloominess.`
`"......Ufufu!`
` Just the two of us sharing our lunches like this... It's sort of...`
` well...`
` .........sort of like something!`
` ...Hau~"`
`"Hahaha... haha..."`
`"............Ahahaha."`
`Our laughter... grew quieter.`
` ...I was the first one to mess up...`
`"Sorry.`
` ...I mean... well, I'm sorry."`
`"......No, it's okay.`
` ...It's not your fault."`
`Our chopsticks... both stopped moving.`
` ...We couldn't keep it up any more.`
`"...Rika-chan, Satoko...`
` I wonder where they went."`
`Those words might have sounded too miserable.`
`...Everyone was thinking it, using roundabout ways to address the topic... but I came right out and said it.`
` I heard Rena catch her breath...`
`"............Yesterday, while you were gone, I heard a bunch of things... so I'll tell you what I know, okay?"`
`".........Sorry again about last night.`
` ...Go ahead."`
`At that time, since they had arrived for support, Rena was helping the ladies' society cook the miso soup we'd had.`
`They reported all of the information the villagers had gathered, and Rena said she overheard it.`
`"...They didn't know anything important, though, did they?`
` Rika-chan and Satoko went home after school, and then apparently went somewhere on their bikes, but other than that..."`
`Mion had told me yesterday.`
` ...We had no clues.`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...The police also said that they probably went out on their bikes to go play somewhere as soon as they got home.`
`...If they were going out to play somewhere on their bikes right after getting home...`
` then they might have gone into town.`
`...So I guess they concluded they disappeared while in Okinomiya.`
` The police were saying how they were going to expand their search to Okinomiya in the morning."`
`In town...`
`......It'd make sense why we couldn't find them even though we searched all of Hinamizawa, then.`
`...Still... something didn't fit.`
`......I had no basis for thinking that... just a gut feeling.`
`I revealed something to Rika-chan that was likely very important to her that day.`
`...Then, Rika-chan had told me to leave it to her.`
` ...And then... err, what did she say...`
`Oh, right—if she didn't work hard, then something bad might happen to the dog, too. I think.`
`With all the talk of dogs and cats... I still didn't have the faintest idea what she really meant, but... it might have been Rika-chan's way of saying this was a race against time.`
`...Damn it!!!`
`I'd selfishly pushed my anxiety on Rika-chan... and tried to run away!`
`When I thought about it... I shouldn't have run back then.`
` I should have asked her more... about the dogs and cats.`
`...The more I think back on it... I really screwed up!!`
`...Anyway... I don't think Rika-chan was in a situation where she would just go off to play somewhere.`
`...Of course, I didn't have any evidence or conviction to base that on.`
` It was just a hunch.`
`".........I don't think...`
` I don't think she'd go into town."`
`"You think so too, Keiichi-kun?`
` I agree.`
` Rika-chan and Satoko-chan must have disappeared in Hinamizawa."`
`I looked back at Rena, startled.`
`...I could hear the conviction in those words.`
`Without replying to my gaze, she took her bento box and went to the hallway.`
`"...I'm going to go rinse this out."`
`She timed that in a way that broke off the conversation.`
`...Suddenly, I got the feeling that the next thing she had to say would be hard to say aloud in the classroom.`
`I hurriedly grabbed my bento box and followed her.`
`...Rena didn't go to the kitchenette, but rather to the water fountains out back, where students seldom went.`
`...The water flowed down onto our bento boxes.`
`...During that time, Rena didn't say a word.`
`Then, after making sure there were no other students around, she finally opened her mouth to speak.`
`"...The whole thing about Rika-chan and Satoko-chan going to town to play and then disappearing...`
` that didn't make sense for some reason...... so I decided to investigate a little bit myself."`
`"...Who did you ask?`
` What did you ask them about?"`
`"I asked the ladies' society all kinds of things.`
` ...There was a lot of tofu in the miso soup yesterday, remember?`
` ...The old lady from the Tomita Tofu shop came, too."`
`......The Tomita Tofu shop...`
`...Oh, I remember.`
`That was one of the stores on the road leading to the hospital.`
`Those huge lumps of tofu dancing in the bathtub-like cistern always looked nice and refreshing.`
`"The old lady says she remembers Satoko-chan stopping to buy tofu there on her way home from school."`
`"...Tofu?`
` Well, it's on the way home, right?`
` How is that a clue?"`
`"Just listen!`
` ...Do you remember when we went to Rika-chan's house?"`
`Rena stepped away from the sinks and spread her arms wide to recreate the space of Rika-chan's room.`
`"......There was a pot on her gas cooker, and there was miso soup in it.`
` I think there was probably about half of it inside.`
` The rest was in the refrigerator.`
` They must have been planning to make chilled tofu. `
`It was on a plate in plastic wrap."`
`As Rena explained, she walked around, as if she were really going through Rika-chan's room.`
`"Still, Rena... why does this matter?"`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` When you make miso soup, you put the tofu in last.`
`That means that Rika-chan, or Satoko-chan, whoever was cooking, was standing there making it up until right before dinnertime."`
`"Right up until...`
` dinnertime...?!"`
`Wasn't everyone saying... that their bikes weren't around, so they must have gone somewhere to play by themselves...?!`
`"The trash in the countertop bin was put in there really awkwardly, too.`
` ...Rika-chan makes most of their food and lunches, but occasionally Satoko-chan does it too.`
` So Satoko-chan was cooking that night."`
`"...So that means...`
` ...that Satoko, at least, didn't go somewhere to play...`
` She was preparing dinner...?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Then I took a look at the rice cooker, and...`
` ...there was rice for two still in there."`
`"...So she made dinner for both of them, but neither of them ate it.`
` ...Is that it?"`
`Rena nodded.`
`"So next I looked in the fridge.`
` There was some chilled tofu, made from the other half that they bought.`
` That's not all, either. `
`There were a whole bunch of plates with side dishes for dinner, and all of them were in plastic wrap."`
`...You usually plastic wrap things so that you can have leftovers for the next day.`
`...My mom does it all the time, too, using them in breakfast or lunch.`
`"That's right.`
` You use plastic wrap to save leftovers for later.`
` ...So the fact that they were in the fridge means that they didn't plan on eating them that night, at least."`
`"...Umm...`
` ...Is that what it means...?"`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` Think a little harder.`
` ...Their dinner was totally untouched and wrapped up.`
` What do you think that means?"`
`"......Umm...`
` ...Well...`
` ...That means they didn't need to eat dinner anymore.`
` ...So they would have gone out to eat, or ordered takeout."`
`"It must have been really sudden, too.`
` If they had decided to do that beforehand, they wouldn't have made anything, but...`
` ...there was dinner for the two of them.`
`That means that when Satoko-chan was making their dinner, they really thought they were going to eat it until right before they didn't."`
`"...So, then...`
` the theory about the two of them going out to play and then disappearing...`
` is wrong..!!"`
`"Yep.`
` ...They disappeared after making dinner, and right before they ate it.`
` ...Probably around seven o'clock."`
`"......Where would they have gone at a time like that by themselves without eating...?"`
`"That's obviously where this is leading.`
` ...Keiichi-kun, do you remember?`
` On their foldout table, there were things like soy sauce and a chopstick holder."`
`...There might have been something like that.`
` ...I didn't remember.`
`"The container for the soy sauce...`
` it was empty.`
` There wasn't even a drop left.`
` Chilled tofu wouldn't taste good without it.`
` So I looked under their sink for the larger bottle of soy sauce they have."`
`"...You sure know a lot about where they keep stuff."`
`"Ahahaha, I've been to Rika-chan's house and cooked for them before."`
`Rena cleared her throat, her face returning to a serious expression.`
`"Then when I opened the cabinet, the big bottle of soy sauce wasn't there at all."`
`"...It wasn't there... Wh-What does that mean...?"`
`"Everything I'm going to say from here on is just Rena's idea.`
` ......So please listen until the end without saying anything."`
`...Last night.`
`Satoko was making dinner like normal.`
`Rika-chan usually watched TV until the food was ready, so she was probably lying down watching a variety show or something.`
`Satoko put the tofu in the miso soup, and right when dinner was about to be ready, she noticed that they were out of soy sauce.`
`So Rika-chan, who had nothing to do, brought the big bottle of soy sauce to a neighbor's house to borrow theirs.`
`"...I don't really know my neighbors that well... Would people be willing to just give her soy sauce?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's not all that uncommon in Hinamizawa."`
`So Rika-chan rode her bike out to get some soy sauce.`
`No matter how long Satoko-chan waited, though, Rika-chan didn't come back.`
`So then Satoko-chan called up the house where Rika-chan was going.`
`...Would Rika happen to be imposing on you?`
` Something like that.`
`Then the other person must have replied with something like this.`
`"'...We have plenty of food here, so you should come too, Satoko-chan.`
` Rika-chan has already eaten.'`
` ...I think that's how they called her out there."`
`Satoko called Rika a few names in private and wrapped up the dinner she had made for them.`
`She put it in the fridge so she could use it for breakfast and lunch the next day.`
`Then Satoko got on her bike too...`
` and headed for the house where Rika-chan was.`
`"Okay, but... this is already pretty strange.`
` You don't normally make so much food that you can give it to people who suddenly arrived at your house."`
`A veteran housewife would never normally make so much food that she could feed two extra people.`
`"...Could it have just been a coincidence that they made too much...?"`
`"It's still unthinkable."`
`Rena flatly denied me.`
`"Since... Rika-chan knew that Satoko-chan had worked really hard to make dinner for them, didn't she?!`
` No matter what kind of food she was offered, she wouldn't let Satoko-chan's dinner go to waste."`
`...This was all only circumstantial evidence and Rena's guesswork.`
`...Even so, it was all... extremely convincing.`
`It was the only ray of hope we had to topple this situation bereft of clues.`
`"...Then, Rena.`
` ...Where did Rika-chan go... to get soy sauce?!"`
`That was the heart of it...!!`
`It would have to be somewhere she'd be comfortable with asking for soy sauce...`
` and somewhere Satoko wouldn't think it suspicious that she'd been invited for dinner.`
` ...So, who was it?!`
`Rena slowly shook her head...`
`"......That's all for Rena's guesses.`
` ...These are all just ideas, okay?`
` Keep them a secret from the police."`
`"What is there to hide...?`
` Even if only half of what you say is right, it should be a good clue for all this..."`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` ...This all means suspecting someone from Hinamizawa.`
` ...We can't suspect anyone without a really good reason."`
`............`
`I saw a few girls coming over to rinse out their bento boxes.`
`...Rena cut the conversation short there and returned to the classroom.`
`I stayed there alone, my body bathed in the lively voices of the cicadas...`
`...Let's think about this.`
`...In my own way.`
`...Rena had barely any information to go on, and yet she'd reasoned out that much.`
`...So there should be something that only I, who knew far more than Rena did, could deduce...`
`Ooishi-san said this last night too, but this incident was definitely occurring within Hinamizawa.`
`...Rena might not have wanted to believe it, but it's basically a given that the culprit is someone from the village.`
`The trigger for everything was when the four of us trespassed in the forbidden storehouse.`
`Somebody saw us going in there.`
`For the culprits, breaking the taboo was a crime punishable by death.`
`...So that night, Tomitake-san and Takano-san were sacrificed.`
`There were two left.`
` ...Shion and myself.`
`However, before the culprits bore their fangs on Shion and me... they went after the mayor, to whom Shion had confessed her sin.`
`Next... they went for Rika-chan, to whom I'd confessed my sin...`
` ...Then what about Satoko?`
` ...Just a stray bullet...?`
`By itself, Rika-chan being sacrificed after I'd told her everything was mortifying...`
` but Satoko, who was sacrificed for no reason... wasn't that all the more regrettable?`
`...Everything... was my fault...!!`
`Who would be the next to disappear?`
`Would it be... Shion and me next time...?`
`...Why... Why weren't the culprits going for Shion and me right away, though?`
`If they had enough power to erase the mayor and Rika-chan, then why not just get rid of Shion and me?`
`If they went for us... well, I wouldn't like it, but I could still tolerate it.`
`......What I couldn't forgive was them getting rid of those we'd confessed to.`
`...Now that I think of it...`
` ...yesterday, Shion said something alarming—she felt like someone was watching her.`
`......So then... was someone watching me as well...?`
`Strangely, though... I hadn't felt anything like that until now.`
`...Even though I'm the root cause of everything, I had never once had that impression.`
`Maybe that was simply because Shion was more cautious than me, and I was just careless.`
`......That's another story, though.`
` ...Let's get back on track.`
`Why weren't the culprits going after Shion and me?`
`......I felt like that's where the key to this lay.`
`...Could it be...`
` Was I making a big assumption that I shouldn't have been...?`
`............`
`I thought and thought, but couldn't come up with an answer.`
`The one thing I understood...`
` was that I was a concerned party to this case...`
` and that I had a duty to watch over it until everything got resolved.`
`I heard the ring of the bell declaring the end of lunch break...`
`Would somebody else disappear tonight?`
`...If nobody else did...`
` then I wanted them to get rid of me tonight for sure...`
` ...and then put an end to all of this.`
`Shion's hysterical voice on the phone last night came back to mind.`
`...They planned to murder those close to us first, make us as miserable as possible, and only then would they kill us...`
`"Maebara-kun, lunch break is over.`
` Go back to the classroom."`
`At the principal's urging, I returned to the classroom, which was quiet as the streets at night...`
