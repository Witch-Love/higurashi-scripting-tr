`I might have explained this before, but...`
`Phys Ed at our school is really just an exercise in disorder.`
`After some random warm-ups, the rest of the time is spent doing whatever.`
` You're free to cause a ruckus or just fall asleep.`
`"...I'm not really sure, but doesn't the Board of Education have some sort of curriculum for this?`
` Something like: 'When you're this old, you should have this amount of physical ability'?"`
`"I have no idea what you're saying, Keiichi-san; it's rather difficult to understand."`
`"Well, you see.`
` It's something like a rule for teachers to follow during class."`
`"Ahahaha!`
` Maybe you weakling city-folk need something like that.`
` But do you really think us country-raised kids would lag behind in physical ability?"`
`"...We're better athletes than you would think, Keiichi."`
`Come to think of it... they might be right.`
`If we all lined up for a race, there was a good chance I'd finish dead last if I didn't start off well.`
`...Let's just pray that when a brutal penalty game is at stake, the 100m dash isn't a club activity.`
`"On that note... I watched too much television so I'm fantastically tired.`
` I'll be using this time to catch up on my sleep.`
` It's 4th period and I'm completely starved.`
` ...If I don't sleep now, when will I ever?"`
`As I began to sprawl out on top of a pipe, Mion grabbed me by the collar.`
`"Tsk tsk tsk.`
` Do you really think I'd let you sleep in peace and quiet~?"`
`"...With that look on your face, it'd require more courage to try and take a nap than not."`
`Good grief...`
` Which means... is it going to start again...!?`
`"Now!!`
` Just killing time with idle chit-chat until the bell rings is impossible for us hot-blooded youth, isn't it?`
` Shall we start a club activity!?"`
`"Hmph, just as I thought, it's come to this.`
` What's today's game!?"`
`Now that this is happening, taking a nap is impossible.`
`Not just that... with this sleep-deprived head of mine, I'm as good as mincemeat!`
`I have to get my brain into gear!!`
`"Rena thinks that we should decide what today's penalty game should be before we start."`
`"Hehehe...`
` Rena knows what's up~!`
` I've prepared something super special today!"`
`She began to announce the cruel penalty game with a grand spinning flourish!`
` But before she could do that—`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I have something that I wanted to do."`
`Of all people, it was Rika-chan announcing her non-participation.`
` Even rare events do eventually occur.`
`...Losing her timing, Mion spun like a top as she tumbled to the ground.`
`"Whaaaaa...`
` ...Huh? What's the matter?`
` Are you not feeling well?"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` Mii-chan, she has to practice for the Watanagashi."`
`"That's right.`
` It's this Sunday.`
` Rika is in the middle of super serious training right now!!"`
`"I've been working too hard lately, so my arms hurt."`
`"I see.`
` Well, there's nothing that can be done.`
` There's no point in doing anything if we can't get everybody together.`
` ...Today, let's just take it easy!"`
`"...I'm very sorry.`
` But I'll try my best."`
`"Yeah! Good luck!`
` We'll be cheering you on~!"`
`When Mion announced that today's club activity was cancelled, Rika-chan and Satoko headed off behind the school building.`
`Only I was left alone, completely clueless as to what everybody was talking about.`
`"...What was that about?`
` Is Rika-chan training for a competition or something??"`
`"Rika-chan is a shrine maiden for the Watanagashi, so she has to perform a ritual dance.`
` It's practice for that."`
`"...Why don't you explain things in order?`
` First of all, what is this Watanagashi?`
` Next, what do you mean by shrine maiden?`
` Last, what do you mean by ritual dance?"`
`"Huh?`
` Didn't you get the notice at your house, Kei-chan?`
` Wasn't it written there?`
` The Watanagashi Festival is this Sunday."`
`...Huh?`
`Come to think of it, I have a feeling Mom did say something about it during dinner the other day.`
`"The Watanagashi is a festival that happens at the shrine on a Sunday every June.`
` It's very lively!"`
`"I see.`
` But 'Watanagashi' sounds like a pretty strange name for it.`
` ...Is it something like...`
` the lantern festival, where they have a memorial for the dead by floating things down the river?"`
`"Oh, I figured you might guess right, Kei-chan!`
` The Watanagashi --or Cotton Drift-- Festival is, as the name implies, where we set cotton adrift down the river."`
`"The cotton, you see, is from futons or jackets.`
` So it'd be something like a futon memorial?`
` ...They also pile futons up on the altar."`
`"I've heard of people leaving offerings of things like needles or kitchen knives to their ancestors or to casualties of war...`
` But an offering of futons is a first for me.`
` What's the history behind that?"`
`Mion tilted her head pensively.`
`"I don't think there's a complicated backstory to it.`
` The winters around here are pretty harsh, so things like warm futons and coats to ward off the cold are fairly important, I guess."`
`"Ah, I see.`
` In other words, it's something like giving thanks to the futons that took care of you during the winter, then.`
` Then, the shrine maiden holds a memorial service for them and set them adrift. `
`That's what the Watanagashi is?"`
`Mion and Rena indicated that I had the correct answer with a round of applause.`
`"And you see, and you see.`
` That shrine maiden performing the memorial is... Rika-chan!"`
`"Oh?`
` So Rika-chan is a shrine maiden.`
` ...Now that you mention it, Rika-chan does have a mystical air about her."`
`"Right? Right!`
` Rika-chan in a shrine maiden outfit... hau~!`
` Sho kyuuute!"`
`...It certainly does seem like it would suit her.`
` Yeah, it might be kyute.`
`"I finally get what you're saying.`
` Rika-chan's training is for her performance as a shrine maiden then."`
`"That would be it.`
` The shrine maiden has to purify a number of futons as part of the ceremony.`
` It's practice for that.`
` ...It's a lot of hard work."`
`"The shrine maiden has to carry a large ceremonial hoe as part of the rite... and it's really heavy for Rika-chan."`
`"Well, Rika-chan is pretty small.`
` ...Exactly how heavy is that hoe?"`
`"It's pretty heavy.`
` ...Enough that Rika-chan has been practicing with a mochi mallet."`
`Wait a minute.`
` That's way too heavy!!`
`Forget about Rika-chan, that'd be rough even for me!`
`"It's a sacred ceremonial hoe...`
` If she dropped it by accident, it'd be big trouble."`
`"Well... it's a once-a-year kind of deal.`
` All we can do is cheer from the sidelines.`
` ...It'll be okay.`
` She pulled it off last year!"`
`"...Really?`
` Then the least I can do is cheer her on!!`
` Even something that little would help, right?"`
`I was rather curious about exactly how she practiced.`
`Mion laughed as she shook her head.`
`"Leave her alone.`
` If you go, Rika-chan will get all cute and won't be able to practice."`
`Hm?`
` I didn't quite understand what Mion was saying.`
`"You see, Rika-chan doesn't like showing people how hard she works.`
` Okay?`
` So just leave her be."`
`...Even the always cool and aloof Rika-chan has times when she sweats while giving it her all.`
`Because she was always so well put together, she didn't want people to see an ungainly side of her... It's not like I couldn't understand that feeling.`
`"All I can do is pray for her success, huh.`
` ...Do your best!!`
` Rika Furude~!!`
` I'm cheering for you~!!!"`
`Well then.`
`I climbed up onto the pipe, and plopped down on my side.`
`"Hooray! Hooray! Riiikaa-chaaaaaan.`
` ...In order to transmit more of my psychic waves of encouragement, I'll be entering a meditative state now.`
` ...zzzzzzz."`
`"So you're just going to sleep after all!?!?"`
`The lackadaisical noontime ended up giving way to mind-numbing afternoon classes.`
`Rebounding from yesterday's hunger, I ate too much for lunch today, leaving me in a horrible condition.`
`"Ugh... I might have gorged myself a bit too much...`
` I'll... have to endure afternoon classes..."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Keiichi-kun, you had an amazing appetite today!"`
`"Basically, you always eat like a pig.`
` But today was on a whole different level."`
`"Yesterday I skipped lunch, right?`
` That hunger just soaked right in.`
` This time, no matter how much I ate, my hunger knew no bounds..."`
`"Ahahaha, I get you. I get you."`
`"But really... Kei-chan, you always finish your lunch down to the last bite.`
` Heck, even down to the last grain of rice."`
`"With food, you show your appreciation for the person who made it by eating it, you know.`
` If you leave any behind, it's rude to the person who put in all that effort."`
`Hearing that, Mion's eyes momentarily widened in surprise, followed by a cool laugh.`
`"Kei-chan, really.`
` At first glance, you seem unruly and irresponsible, but you're actually pretty conscientious.`
` Well-disciplined, or something like that."`
`"Ah, yeah. Rena thinks so too. Thinks so too!`
` Keiichi-kun is a lot kinder than he looks!"`
`...Both of them were probably trying to compliment me, but I had a strange feeling I wasn't being complimented at all.`
`"That's not true!`
` I just wanted to say that there's a big gap between your appearance and your personality."`
`"And I'm saying that's not a compliment!"`
`"Hey!`
` Sonozaki-san! Maebara-kun! We're in the middle of class!`
` How far did you get, Sonozaki-san? Bring your notes up here."`
`Startled, Mion vocalized a rather easy to understand utterance.`
`She was so enthralled in the conversation, she had stopped working completely.`
`"Ummm... Uhh....`
` Doing all right...☆"`
`"You haven't progressed at all!!`
` You're in the highest grade, so you have to shape up!!"`
`That Mion, it looks like she's getting lectured.`
` Poor bastard.`
`"Appearances can be deceiving, in other words.`
` ...Actually, appearance might be the opposite of reality."`
`"...Hmmm? You say some interesting things."`
`Responding to Rena's seemingly profound statement, I turned my gaze to where Satoko was happily studying together with Rika-chan.`
`"Are you saying that brat Satoko is actually really meek?"`
`If I went by what Rena literally said, then that would be the case.`
`I could hardly imagine Satoko being meek and gentle like a girl in some fairy tale.`
`"Satoko-chan's been rude lately, but just a while ago she was pretty different.`
` She acted really spoiled and always--`
` ...`
` Yup.`
` Ehehe... keep this a secret from Satoko-chan, okay☆?"`
`"That Satoko... acting so cute!?"`
`For Satoko to play coy, I think that would have to be some part of some calculated plot.`
`Even if she was to hide behind someone, I wouldn't think it was because she was attached to them.`
`...But since it came up, I tried to imagine a gentle and coquettish Satoko.`
`"Hey, Satoko."`
`"What is it, onii-sama☆?"`
`Satoko smiled cutely, and walked towards me...`
`By the way, for every three steps forward Satoko took, for some reason I took three steps away.`
`"Hm?`
` Onii-sama, why are you running away...?"`
`"Sorry, Satoko.`
` ...For you to approach me with an affectionate smile on your face, I just have to think it's some sort of trap."`
`"Th-That's so mean!`
` Onii-sama you meanie~!`
` Waaaaaaaa~~!!!!"`
`"A-Ah...So-So-Sorry!! I didn't intend to be so mean!"`
`The weeping Satoko came closer to me...`
` ...I'm a sucker for tears...`
`*click*`
` *CLANK*`
`Huh!?`
`A bear trap!?!?`
`My leg was being clamped down on by jagged metal teeth!`
`"Ohohoho!!`
` You fell for it!!`
` Now for the next part!!"`
`Satoko raised her right arm triumphantly... and traps began to trigger one after another!!`
`Suddenly, the wall sprang forward, throwing me three blocks away!`
`And there I saw... a giant metal ball covered in spikes, hurtling towards me!!!!`
`On top of that, in the direction the ball would knock me was a giant guillotine!!!!`
`"I'm not really sure, but Keiichi-kun... you're not thinking of anything completely ludicrous right now, are you?"`
`"Not really.`
` Not at all..."`
`"That's a lie.`
` You've got the kind of look on your face that says: 'I'm gonna be crushed by a giant spiked metal ball~!'"`
`...How could my expression convey what I was thinking like that?`
`"Sorry.`
` ...Imagining a meek and gentle Satoko is impossible right now.`
` ...I'll try again when I'm in better shape..."`
`Next, I looked over at Rika-chan, who was working diligently on some kanji drills.`
`In contrast to Satoko, her default state was meek and gentle.`
`If Rika-chan came at me saying "Onii-sama~☆," I'd hug her.`
` Tightly.`
` I could get used to that!!`
`"Keiichi-kun, you're drooling."`
`"Ah, sorry, sorry.`
` ...Then, how about Rika-chan?`
` Are you saying that her appearance is deceiving as well?"`
`Saying that out loud, I felt a tinge of doubt.`
`...Was Rika-chan really all sweet??`
`Despite her appearance... she really was quite sly. Sweetly... how do you put it... evading things deftly?`
`"...I get the feeling that Rika-chan isn't only just sweet.`
` ...Her appearance is definitely deceiving."`
`I couldn't put exactly what I was imagining into words, but Rena managed to say what I wanted to.`
`She turned to me with an impish look in her eyes, like she was saying: "Ahh, you shouldn't say something like that~"`
`"When Rika-chan grows up, I'm sure she'll become an incredibly devilish beauty, with men wrapped all around her little finger.`
` Don't you think that would be cool?"`
`Rena said that lightheartedly... but I, as a man, couldn't laugh at that.`
`The scary part about that was that it felt like it could be true.`
`Noticing my gaze, Rika-chan turned towards me and let loose with an angelic smile.`
`Both Rena and I, feeling as if that was directed towards us personally, had our hearts skip a beat.`
`"Hau~~... Sho kyu-kyu-kyuuuuute. Sho kyuuuuute☆"`
`"Rena, your nose is bleeding."`
`...Appearances can be deceiving, huh.`
` ...Well then, what about our Dear Leader, Mion?`
`I stared at her as she tried to weasel her way out of her scolding by the teacher.`
`By Rena's theory, that unrefined, calculating, conniving Mion also had a side of her that belied appearances.`
` ...`
`"Then what you're saying is: 'That Mion, despite her appearance, is actually a good person'?"`
`"Mii-chan *is* a good person."`
`"Oh, well, that *is* true!`
` But what I'm trying to say is..."`
`"Yup yup~. I know what you're trying to say, Keiichi-kun."`
`Catching on that I was struggling to express my feelings as words, Rena smiled even more brightly.`
`"Know what?"`
`"Mii-chan is mysterious, right?`
` She's a girl, but it's like she's a guy."`
`That's right.`
` Mion was more than aware that she was a girl, but it was exactly as Rena said.`
`When Mion livened up the mood, it wasn't as though she felt like a guy or a girl specifically, but a friend of the same gender.`
`"If she were a guy... we'd probably be like two peas in a pod.`
` ...Although, that's the same way it is right now. Ahaha!"`
`"But you see.`
` Even that Mii-chan...`
` is actually really feminine."`
`"...Rena.`
` How much did Mion pay you exactly?"`
`"Thaat's noooot trueee~!`
` Geez, I'm trying to have a serious conversation, you know? You know?"`
`Rena began to pout. Now probably wasn't the right time to joke around.`
`"Mii-chan is the club president, so she's trying hard to lead everybody.`
` But she's really a very cute girl.`
` I really don't want you to forget that, Keiichi-kun..."`
`...Rena's gaze focused off into the distance, beyond where Mion was.`
`The Mion that I met at Angel Mort was unimaginably different compared to the Mion that I normally knew.`
`Flustered and hesitant from the unfamiliar job.`
` It was a far cry from the brash and confident Mion.`
`Even though she had to hurry to work, she went through all the trouble to bring me food when I was on the brink of starvation.`
` And she did so not as Mion, but as Shion.`
`What exactly was Shion to Mion?`
` What kind of person was Mion exactly?`
`"Keiichi-kun probably couldn't even begin to imagine. Begin to imagine! ...Hehehe!"`
`As if to say it was our little secret, Rena held her finger up to her lips as she giggled.`
`Mion—finally free from the teacher's preaching—returned to her seat, cradling her head to hide her embarrassment.`
`"Hmph!`
` This old man, you see, thinks that grade school is enough for everything you need to study for in life."`
`Saying that, she plopped down into her seat violently.`
`Mion was actually really feminine. Right.`
`I wonder if I can meet Shion again.`
`...I wanted to talk to her again.`
`*CLANG CLANG*`
`The principal waved around the bell that served as the school chime.`
`The teacher rushed back to the black board and began to list everybody's homework assignments.`
`"Whoa.`
` It looks like there's gonna be a lot of homework today. Gotta buckle down!"`
`"Well then.`
` ...That means, even Rena?"`
`"Huh? What do you mean?"`
`"Appearances can be deceiving.`
` Would that apply to you too?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ahahahaha...`
` Keiichi-kun... how do you see me?`
` How? How?"`
`The Rena Ryuugu that I knew... sometimes took things too far, but was generally a kind and gentle, ideal girl.`
`"Really? Really...?`
` Then... that m-m-makes... me happy I guess..."`
`If she was the opposite of what she seemed, that would make her...`
`"...and if you were really the opposite...?"`
`"..."`
`Just try saying it, I won't be mad.`
` ...That's what I felt she meant.`
`"...Rena is..."`
`"Uh-huh. Rena is...?"`
`"E-`
` ...Even if you were the opposite, you'd still be Rena.`
` ...Right?"`
`This question shouldn't have been so nerve-wracking to answer.`
`...Maybe it was because the person in question was staring at me, but...`
`Even saying that took a strange amount of effort.`
`"Th-That's no fair, Keiichi-kun.`
` It bothers me when you say it that way~ ...Hau!!"`
`Perhaps unable to endure my silence, Rena's face began to burn red with embarrassment.`
`"Rena~!!`
` Kei-cha~n!!`
` Let's go home!!"`
`Mion walked over and started getting ready to go home.`
`Whenever school is over, she really does get noticeably more energetic.`
`It was the same relaxing walk home as always.`
`Digging around my pocket on a whim, I noticed something that should have been there was missing.`
`"What's the matter, Kei-chan?"`
`"...The key to my house I always carry around is gone.`
` ...Man, where did I lose it?`
` It's fine today since my parents are home, but still, this is bad."`
`"That sure is troublesome...`
` Did you forget it somewhere?`
` Or did you drop it?"`
`Which one was it?`
`Did I take it with me this morning in the first place?`
` ...Huh? Huh?`
`"Kei-chan, did that key have anything that would make it stand out?"`
`"Yeah, it's on a keychain.`
` It was a blue fur seal, something I made for summer homework a long time ago."`
`"Huh? ...Does it have its eyes shut, like it's taking a nap?"`
`"Oh, how did you know?`
` Yeah, yeah, that's it!"`
`Mion looked away and began to whistle.`
`"Ummm... see.`
` You went for dinner at Angel Mort a couple of days ago, right?`
` That night, the staff found a key...`
` And there was a fur seal keychain attached to it."`
`As she said that, she suddenly grew flustered, and added that Shion had told her about it.`
`"Huh!?`
` So, I dropped it then..."`
`"Ahahaha, but aren't you glad they found it?`
` I'm sure they're looking after it for you."`
`"That's right.`
` Why don't you go?`
` Shion looks the same as me, so you'll know her by sight."`
`This was... a rather unexpected development.`
` ...Once again, I had no choice but to go and meet with Shion...`
`But I also had to thank her for the bento from yesterday.`
`Besides, taking some time and chatting with this other side of Mion might be interesting... Half-jokingly, I began to think about things like this.`
`"Right.`
` Angel Mort, was it? I'll head over to Shion's restaurant and get my key back.`
` While I'm at it, having a nice spot of tea might not be a bad idea."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` You sound like an English gentleman.`
` That totally doesn't suit you, Kei-chan!"`
`"Is this the restaurant?`
` The one that Mii-chan's little sister is working at?"`
`"Yeah. Why don't we go together, Rena?"`
`"Sorry to disappoint you... but I have plans with my father today.`
` Some other time."`
`Rena seemed pretty disappointed about having to miss such a great opportunity.`
`"You said they're twins, but do they really look that much alike?`
` Enough to mistake which is which?"`
`"Yeah, they're totally the same.`
` At least on the outside.`
` ...Unlike Mion, she's well-mannered and really cute, though..."`
`In response to my teasing, Mion pouted and began to argue with me.`
`...I couldn't help but burst out laughing at Mion's little farce.`
`After all, they weren't just identical, they were the same person.`
`After going home, I changed my clothes and dug my bike out of the garage.`
`Just thinking that I would be able to meet Shion again gave me a mysterious feeling.`
`Shion, a name for a different kind of Mion.`
`...She was a mysterious and ridiculous person, believing she had fooled everyone like that.`
`I noticed that I was pedaling along quite happily.`
`Could it be that I was looking forward to meeting Shion?`
`I felt a sense of giddy anticipation, like I was headed towards a new friend's house for the first time.`
`What Rena said about Mion actually being really feminine sprang to mind once again.`
`The guilt from spying on another side of Mion, the self-consciousness from being the only one that knew about that side, these feelings mixed together.`
`That was Shion for you.`
` Mion's little twin sister.`
`...Until she felt like coming out and admitting she was Mion, it was fine to just call her Shion, right?`
`Mion might be trying to have some fun by acting out a different persona.`
`As I reached the top of the steep hill, the horizon expanded before me. I was almost at the station.`
`The last time I wasn't embarrassed since I was here with Dad, but this time I was alone... I was strangely self-conscious about it.`
`Meet Shion, get my key back.`
` That was all this task was supposed to be...`
`If I dawdled around like this, maybe Shion would find me before she headed in for work.`
`...Hey, hey! What are you doing, Keiichi Maebara!`
`You're just here to get your key back, you know?`
`It's not like you're some love-struck schoolboy here to hand over a love letter!`
`Aahhh... the thoughts inside my head were slowly turning into a jumbled mess...`
`I came to the realization that I was downright giddy.`
`That's why... for just a bit...`
`Just a tiny little bit...`
`...I got a little carried away and did something really stupid.`
`I kicked over a parked motorcycle that was blocking the sidewalk.`
`It was in the way, sure, but there was absolutely no need for me to kick it.`
` ...I definitely think I got too carried away.`
`*thunk, clack*`
` *CRASH!!*`
`As the three bikes toppled one after another like dominos, the loud noise they caused snapped me back to my senses.`
`"...Oh ...Shi--"`
`"The hell you think yer doin'!!!"`
`...The owners of those three bikes were right there.`
`They looked exactly like what you'd call 'thugs up to no good.'`
`They lifted their heads up in an imposing manner, and yelled angrily in a way I had never heard before.`
`The three of them beelined towards me, the worn-down heels of their thin-soled shoes slapping noisily against the pavement. I could only stare listlessly, as if I were watching some far-off event that didn't concern me at all.`
`By the time I realized it, I had been grabbed by the collar and lifted onto my tip-toes.`
`"Dun be playin' dumb!!`
` Ye knockt em ova didntcha!?`
` HuuuUUUhhhh!?"`
`The three thugs were completely ignoring the rules of grammar, but the way they spoke was enough to make me tremble.`
`...Just like that, my composure drained away... my legs buckled and my throat grew dry enough to crack.`
`"I-I'm s-sorry... I a-accidentally--"`
`"Axident my ass!`
` Ye kickt it didntcha dumbass!!"`
`I was completely at fault, so there was nothing I could say in my defense.`
`...As a result I was pulled even higher...`
`"Da hell man!!`
` Da paint's all scuffed!!!"`
`"Yo, brat!!`
` Who putchu upta dis eh!?"`
`"Dis iz yer gerdam fault!!"`
`The three of them continued to yell at me. I had no idea what each of them were saying.`
`Getting further enraged that I was only listening while dumbstruck, they grabbed an empty plastic crate from a nearby store and began to smash it repeatedly against a telephone pole.`
`Cracks formed in the crate, plastic shards flying everywhere.`
` They then slammed it full-force into the shuttered storefront.`
`*SMASH*`
`The shutter let out a frighteningly loud noise.`
`Still not satisfied, they flipped over a case of empty cans, scattering its contents all over the place.`
`...Th-This was not normal...`
`It was something you saw often on television or in manga, but I never thought seeing it in person would be this terrifying...`
`I became painfully aware that the safety of civilized society was only held up by such a frail concept as morals.`
`My knees clattered together noisily.`
` Static began to pepper my vision...`
`This is what you would call... absolute terror.`
`There was nothing I could do to stop this frightening spectacle of violence.`
`I could only pray for help...`
`...The fear I felt was just too much...`
`Would somebody... help me?`
` My gaze floundered about the surrounding area.`
`I was surrounded by these three hoodlums.`
`No way would there be a passerby brave enough to intervene.`
`Maybe this was what you call... reaping what you sow.`
`...If I were a passerby... there would be no doubt that I'd ignore what was going on.`
`So this was somewhat of a cosmic retribution...`
`"Fookin' say sumtin!!!`
` I'll fookin' stab ye!!!"`
`Angry yelling loud enough to rattle my eardrums spewed forth right in front of my face.`
`My waning consciousness was forcefully dragged back to the forefront.`
`The thug had cocked back his free hand and twisted his body, when suddenly, a metallic taste filtered through the back of my throat.`
`A chill ran down my spine like a jolt of electricity.`
`...Seeing what was going to happen next, I squeezed my eyes shut as tightly as possible and grit my teeth!!!`
`"You're making quite the racket, you stupid pieces of trash...`
` Get out of my sight."`
`...That voice was a short distance away.`
`Still holding me by the collar, the three thugs spun around to look behind them.`
`"Dafuq ye say!!!"`
`Standing there was Shion.`
` ...I mean, Mion.`
` ...She stood there, displaying an imposing stature that I'd never seen before.`
`She didn't have the same look on her face as she did when we were playing around during club.`
`...Those were the eyes that would instill fear in anyone who looked upon them: the eyes of a raptor.`
`...They were the epitome of terror...`
` At the same time, they were the most reassuring things in the world.`
`"I'll only say this one more time.`
` ...Let go of Kei-chan and get lost."`
`Mion, without an ounce of fear, laid down her ultimatum.`
`Of course there was no way those three wouldn't go absolutely berserk.`
`The situation instantly turned explosively dangerous...`
`"Ye fookin biiiiitch!!`
` I'll fookin bash yer ead in!!"`
`Stop it, Mion... these guys are like rabid dogs!`
` No amount of bluffing will work!`
`"...Mi-Mion...`
` It's dangerous...`
` So ru—"`
`I knew what I was saying was pathetic.`
` ...But... I couldn't let Mion get involved in this!`
`No matter how you looked at it, Mion was only bluffing.`
`...But, did Mion even know the meaning of the word "bluff"?`
`However... the reason behind everything soon became apparent.`
`...They were slowly increasing in number. Little by little.`
`At first, it was only businessmen on their way home stopping to take a look.`
`Then, it was housewives in the middle of shopping taking a gander.`
`...Next, what seemed like the owner of some store showed up... and it was pretty clear he wasn't just looking.`
`Around Mion... there was already about seven people gathered.`
`It felt different than people coming out to support a friend.`
`...If I had to say why, it was because the group that gathered was diverse in age and gender.`
`The three thugs seemed to slowly realize that there was something strange about the situation.`
`"Who da hell are deez guys!!"`
`Behind them, at some point four more people of differing clothes and ages had gathered.`
`A girl who looked to be in middle school.`
`A man wearing a bakery apron.`
`An old lady in a house-cleaning smock.`
`More and more... people of various ages.`
`Their gazes, comparable to Mion's, were of hostility.`
` Of intimidation.`
`Before I realized it, over ten people had formed a ring around us.`
`At that moment, five elementary schoolers ran in and joined the circle.`
`...There were some familiar faces.`
` Some of our classmates.`
`...Then these people were... residents of Hinamizawa!?`
`More and more people from Hinamizawa gathered around.`
`...In obvious contrast, the residents of Okinomiya were passing by as quickly as possible.`
`"Dafuq are you guys?`
` Go dafuq away!!"`
`The group surrounding us had suddenly swelled to around twenty people.`
`...Completely encircled, the faces of the thugs began to show the first signs of panic...`
`Nobody spoke a word, Mion included.`
`That made everything completely unnatural, and depending on which side you were on, completely terrifying.`
`...Only the thugs voices echoed out like they were screaming.`
`Somebody took a step forward, closing the gap between them.`
`...As they did, everybody else took a step forward, shrinking the circle.`
`The hoodlums went pale as they were pushed together, back-to-back, while still yelling angrily.`
`They were trying to string together vulgarities, but for some reason it sounded like they were crying out for help...`
`"All right, all right, all right, what's going on here? What's going on!?"`
`It was sudden.`
` A solidly-built officer cut his way through the crowd.`
`At some point two police cars had arrived.`
` Some passerby had undoubtedly called for them.`
`Several burly officers appeared from inside the 2nd vehicle.`
`"...Oh, Officer, good timing!`
` There you go, the extortionists, caught red handed.`
` Please arrest them."`
`"Dafuq!?`
` Dis brat's da one dat's wrong here!!"`
`Mion, returning to her usual self, was nonchalantly pointing out the hoodlums to the police.`
`Of course the thugs were furious.`
`But, now that it had come to this, there was nothing they could do.`
`It was their loss.`
`"Okay, okay!!`
` Come over here for a sec.`
` Come on already!!"`
`The officers handcuffed the thugs and dragged them towards the patrol cars.`
`"Dafuq, lemme go!!`
` We're da victims here, are you listenin' dammit!!"`
`No matter how much of a ruckus they caused, the officers paid no heed.`
`In the blink of an eye, they were crammed inside the two vehicles.`
`They could still be heard yelling while inside the police cars, but what they were saying was no longer intelligible.`
`"Are you all right?`
` Are you injured?"`
`He was probably a detective.`
` The man leading the police peered at my face.`
`"...No... not really."`
`"Nfu-fu-fu-fu!`
` Well, that's a bit of a silver lining then.`
` Well then, have a good year."`
`The portly man, after taking a quick look around, addressed the crowd.`
`"Thank you, citizens, for your timely report.`
` Thanks to your efforts, we were able to keep the peace today.`
` It's a wonderful thing.`
` ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`"...Thank you for your hard work,`
` Detective Ooishi.`
` As a citizen, I thank you for your daily efforts.`
`It's an honor for a detective from the first division to come out all this way."`
`...The way Shion talked didn't have a very pleasant tone.`
`"It was a coincidence.`
` I happened to hear the call over the radio on my way back from the prefectural office.`
` I just made a little detour."`
`"Please keep up the good work.`
` I pray for success in your future endeavors."`
`"Nfu-fu-fu-fu!`
` Aww shucks.`
` It's a good thing there were no injuries, though."`
`"Ooishi-sa~n!`
` We're done here!`
` Let's go!"`
`"Well then, have a good year.`
` ...I'm sorry, could you make way?"`
`The detective named Ooishi, after jovially making pleasantries, lumbered over to the waiting police car.`
`It quickly set off, disappearing down the city street.`
`It was over so quickly.`
`...So quickly, I was dumbstruck.`
`I didn't even get to ask the officer what was going on.`
`...It was like they came here quickly to disperse the mob before any trouble could start.`
`After making sure the police cars had left, Mion snapped her fingers sharply.`
`"All right! That's a wrap!!`
` And don't come back!"`
`That was the signal.`
` The tension melted away in an instant as everybody began smiling.`
`A middle-aged man helped me up.`
`"Are you okay, young Maebara?`
` Next time pick your fights a bit better~."`
`"I-It's not like I wanted to fight..."`
`"Are you hurt anywhere?`
` If you hit your head it would be a good idea to get an X-ray taken."`
`An older lady I didn't know the name of was concerned about my injury.`
`"You were lucky this happened right in front of the station when it was busy, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to gather as many people.`
` Next time, be more careful!`
` City kids these days are pretty unruly! `
`*grumble*"`
`I was even warned by the old lady in the smock.`
`As Shion finished applauding the dispersing group for their efforts, she strode over to me.`
`"Well well... you're pretty good, Kei-chan.`
` But I also think you should be more careful about who you pick a fight with~."`
`"Th-Thanks, Mion...`
` ...you saved my bacon there."`
`"...Like I said, I'm Shion..."`
`She made a troubled expression as she turned her gaze downward, blushing in embarrassment.`
`"I heard from my sister.`
` That fur seal keychain was yours, Kei-chan?"`
`"Oh... yeah, that's right.`
` ...I was just heading to the restaurant."`
`"And you ended up feeling so excited that you got mixed up in something weird?"`
`Now it was my turn for my face to go red.`
`I... didn't want to admit... that she was spot on.`
`"Well... I was just unlucky.`
` But you really saved me, Shion."`
`"You don't have to thank me.`
` So, if you see somebody else getting bullied, help them out, okay?`
` ...We value that kind of thing very highly here."`
`I was well-versed in that sense of camaraderie.`
`...But, the way I was rescued just now... something seemed a little off about that.`
`While I was helped out, it was honestly to an almost disturbing degree...`
`"...You're coming into the restaurant, right?`
` You must be tired, so why don't you relax for a bit?`
` My treat."`
`...Seems that she caught the glimmer of suspicion in my eyes.`
`Without waiting for my answer, Shion began walking.`
`After cooling off a bit inside the restaurant, little by little, I realized I was still on edge.`
`There were spots here and there on my body that hurt, probably because I had been so stiff with nervousness.`
`Shion, who had changed into her uniform, brought over two glasses of iced coffee.`
`"Here you go. Iced coffee, on the house.`
` Just bring this coupon with you to the register and it'll be no charge."`
`...My patheticness really knew no bounds...`
` But since she went through the trouble, I might as well take her up on the offer.`
`Even though it had started out as such a lovely day... I had to get carried away and do that stupid thing.`
` ...I had completely ruined it.`
`"But really,`
` ...you really saved my hide there.`
` I've really come to see you as reliable."`
`"Even I was scared.`
` But, Kei-chan was in trouble so...`
` I had to be brave and do my best."`
`While a little embarrassed by what she just said, Shion made a show of folding her arms boldly.`
`"Shion, really, thank you..."`
`...I was thanking Shion.`
` ...But I really wanted to thank Mion.`
` ...Mion, really, thank you...`
`"Now now, cheer up a little.`
` If you feel indebted, then when you have the chance you should help somebody in need.`
` ...Like for example, if I'm ever in trouble.`
` Please come and save me."`
`"Ah, ...yeah, of course.`
` It's a promise."`
`"Ahahahaha! You absolutely have to!"`
`Taking advantage of my words, she seemed happy about my promise.`
`"So if I'm ever in trouble, Kei-chan will come and save me~!`
` I hope trouble comes soon~☆.`
` ...Ah, you finally smiled."`
`She said as she smiled herself, poking me in the cheek.`
`"A downtrodden Kei-chan is as good as an imposter.`
` Come on, smile, smile!"`
`"Th-That tickles!`
` S-Stop, wahahahaha...!!"`
`Thanks to Shion's meddling, I finally cheered up a little.`
`All the muscles in my body that had stiffened because of the incident finally began to relax a little...`
`"When you're in a better mood, don't you get a little hungry?`
` I'm kind of hungry so I want to eat some pancakes or something.`
` Do you want some too, Kei-chan?"`
`I wanted to show a little restraint, but restraint really wasn't my thing.`
` That's why I replied without any.`
`"They're good, right?`
` I'm pretty picky when it comes to pancakes."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Don't worry.`
` Our pancakes have a pretty good reputation."`
`Shion ordered some pancakes from a nearby waitress.`
`An employee ordering from another employee seems kind of weird...`
`"...Hey, hey, speaking of that, weren't you in the middle of a shift?`
` You've just been slacking off while talking to me."`
`"I told my uncle that you saved me when I was surrounded by hoodlums, so he's rewarding you☆.`
` So I have the manager's permission."`
`"That's exactly the opposite of what happened... Is that all right!?"`
`"It's perfectly fine. ...Ahahahahahahaha!"`
`By the time the pancakes arrived, we had entered into a relaxed conversation.`
`As the two of us ate pancakes, we livened the mood with some chit-chat.`
`...About what was on TV, celebrities, that kind of thing.`
`Hobbies, food.`
` Really, nothing more than idle chit-chat.`
`Talking together like this, I once again became conscious of Shion being a girl.`
`...Hey now, that's funny talk, Keiichi Maebara.`
`Shion and Mion are the same person.`
`If there was anything different between them... it was only whether or not Mion admitted she was Mion.`
`But given that, how come our conversation was this different?`
`"Kei-chan, you don't think of my sister as a girl, do you~."`
`"Th-That's not true.`
` If she were a guy I'd punch the living daylights out of her!"`
`"I think the reason you guys get along so well is because you have that kind of platonic relationship.`
` ...That's a pretty rare and enviable thing to have, don't you think?"`
`"...I don't get what you're saying...`
` But it really would be a waste to treat her like a girl."`
`"Heeey, Kei-chan, that's sexist! Ahahahahaha!"`
`Hearing the word "sexist" was cause for introspection.`
`What was I prejudiced against Mion and Shion for?`
`Mion was Mion.`
`She was the best friend a guy could have, no reservations, and head and shoulders above me when it came to club activities.`
`If I had met her five years earlier, my life would have probably been a lot more fun. Of this I had no doubt.`
`Then what about Shion?`
`...She was Mion's little sister, and it hadn't even been three days since we met.`
` Her relationship was much more distant as the only thread we had in common was that I knew her sister.`
`And for Shion, it was the same. I was somebody she met three days ago only because I was a friend of her sister's.`
`...The difference between Mion and Shion?`
` ...Friendliness?`
` ...Familiarity?`
`...Playing around with those unclear thoughts for a while, I had stopped listening to Shion.`
`"Hypothetically, okay? Are you listening?"`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` Yeah, I'm listening."`
`"This is just an hypothetical question, okay?`
` Both me and my sister are in trouble, okay?`
` We're dangling off the side of a cliff.`
` Which one of us do you save?`
` You can only save one."`
`She wasn't saying it to tease me, but had a playful tone behind her voice.`
`"Th-That's not a nice question...!`
` I want to save you both... but I can't do that, right?"`
`"Right.`
` You can only save either Shion or Mion.`
` Who do you save?"`
`...If it were Mion, I don't think she'd be in that situation in the first place, as it's something she could easily get out of herself.`
`...But what about the normal, frail Shion?`
` I guess... I'd have no choice.`
`"It's not my sister, right?"`
`If Mion and Shion were different people, I suppose it would come to that.`
`I couldn't confirm nor deny it.`
`...She should have been smiling, but her gaze was locked firmly to mine.`
`"In other words,`
` that's it, isn't it?`
` My sister is...`
` ...huh,`
` ...ehehehe!`
` Sorry, I messed up what I was trying to say."`
`Shion was trying to talk in a light-hearted manner, but I felt that there was something more behind her words.`
`Was Mion trying to tell me something through Shion?`
`Not being able to put a finger on exactly what it was was vexing.`
`Shion, to hide her embarrassment, turned the conversation around.`
`"More importantly, just now...`
` Were you surprised?`
` When everybody kept on showing up."`
`"Of course I was!`
` If it were Rena or Satoko that would have been one thing,`
` but for all those people, young and old to gather...`
` They were all from Hinamizawa, right?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Everybody in Hinamizawa is pretty close-knit.`
` An enemy of one is the enemy of all.`
` Nobody is going to look on from the sidelines.`
` ...Ehehe, they're a pretty reliable group of residents."`
`"...If somebody is being picked on, then everybody unites to get rid of the bully.`
` It kind of sounds like the mafia or the yakuza's brand of unity!"`
`"You shouldn't say something like that.`
` It's something you should be thankful for.`
` You were saved by that unity, weren't you?`
` Never forget to show your appreciation!"`
`I half-heartedly agreed.`
`I knew full well I should be appreciative.`
`"Everybody really is close-knit, aren't they?"`
`"...Maybe it's because of tradition?`
` Hinamizawa has been in danger of becoming a ghost town on several occasions. `
`There's been a history of the villagers uniting together each time to fight for the village's continued existence.`
` For example~... Kei-chan, did you know about the Hinamizawa Dam Project?"`
`Hinamizawa Dam Project?`
`...Let's see... I feel like I've heard somebody talk about it before.`
`"About ten years ago, there was a sudden proposal to build a dam here, which would have submerged Hinamizawa underwater."`
`"Oh, that story. I think I heard my dad talk about that...`
` But I'm pretty sure that plan was cancelled, right?"`
`"We made them cancel it.`
` Everybody banded together!`
` So that was a well-earned victory."`
`That sounded pretty much like the story I heard.`
`The protest intensified to the point where it was featured in newspapers and magazines.`
` ...As a result, the plan was suspended.`
`"The whole story with the dam apparently started before I was born.`
` At first, the proposal was only for exploratory purposes, or a small dam to control erosion."`
`But, then the cat was let out of the bag...`
`If it were completed it would have been the biggest dam in Japan. Not just Hinamizawa, but several villages upstream would have been submerged as well.`
`The protests immediately began.`
`Petitions to cancel or relocate the project were drafted and submitted to the Diet.`
`They even went so far as to go to the Ministry of Construction in Tokyo to hand over a direct appeal to the Minister.`
`The previous landowner sued the government, stating there were inconsistencies in the purchase agreement and the transaction should be nullified. `
`Owners of yet unacquired land split their properties, increasing the number of landowners in order to stifle the project.`
`"It was all very precious when the land acquisition was still about money.`
` Eventually, they started relying on eminent domain in order to seize land.`
` It started at that point. `
`The riot police began to get violent."`
`"Riot police...`
` You mean the police?`
` Why would they act violent!?"`
`"They punched.`
` They kicked!`
` There was a time I was hit.`
` Right around here I think.`
` My skin split open and a whole lot of blood spilled out."`
`Saying that, Shion indicated her temple by poking at it.`
`"Wh-What happened to the police?"`
`Filing a complaint against the riot police for police brutality would seem kind of strange for some reason.`
`Naturally they wouldn't pay heed to something like that.`
`You wouldn't be able to establish proof on who exactly hit you, and they could justify their actions by saying you were interfering with police duties.`
`"My Nana went off like a firework.`
` After that it was amazing!`
` Like a full-scale war.`
` We weren't just going to sit by and idly file complaints.`
` We went on the offensive."`
`First, in order to call attention to the government, they filed a temporary injunction in court.`
`Then, in order to gain public support, they called in prominent scientists to state that Hinamizawa was a valuable nature preserve.`
`They pressured the prefectural and municipal assemblies, saying that the prefectural governor ignored his constituents when he approved the project, and demanded his resignation. They completely and thoroughly denounced him.`
`Naturally, in Hinamizawa, a ferocious conflict worthy of being called the "Dam War" began.`
`In order to suppress the police's brutality, they coordinated with the network channels and exposed the violence of the riot squad members to the public.`
`On top of that, they put together a special exposé themed around the government repressing the citizens, and aired it nationally.`
` It worked wonders.`
` Following that, the SWAT teams had their hands cuffed.`
`Day after day, the petitions and demonstrations continued. Propaganda was used to help garner support.`
`The circle of support gradually expanded outwards from Hinamizawa...`
` Either that bore fruit, or the government finally decided against it. `
`It was announced that the Dam Project was indefinitely suspended just a few years ago.`
`"We did everything we could.`
` The entire village banded together and fought.`
` At that time, we were desperate... but now that it's over it's actually become a pretty good memory. `
`...The villagers' feelings of solidarity and unity still haven't faded."`
`Shion said that as she focused off into the distance.`
`I felt that those eyes weren't filled with anguish, but rather, a sense of pride.`
`"That kind of solidarity... is pretty nice.`
` You don't see it too often.`
` Bridging the generation gap and unifying the region."`
`"I think so too.`
` The Dam Project was a trial. I think that just the fact we were able to overcome it is huge."`
`The fear I was feeling until just now gradually began to fade.`
`When people began to show up one after another while I was engaged with those thugs, I thought it was frightening.`
`...But now, I felt from the bottom of my heart that I had been rude.`
`The villagers, prepared to defend their homeland to the death.`
` The sense of solidarity that fostered.`
`...It might seem impudent to say this, but... I was a little jealous.`
`If I had been in Hinamizawa when the protest against the dam was going on, I might have been able to share in that sense of solidarity.`
`"Kei-chan, you weren't here at the time, so I don't think you can fully feel the solidarity in the village.`
` ...But everybody shares it.`
` Thoroughly.`
` Even with somebody who just moved here like you, Kei-chan."`
`...She couldn't have been more right.`
`So many people got together to help me out when I just moved here.`
` ...Even though they were strangers whose names I didn't even know.`
`...A hot feeling began welling up inside of me.`
`When I lived in the city, I didn't even know my own neighbors.`
`I thought that was natural.`
` But... here, that was an absurd and pathetic thing.`
`Even though I thought of them as strangers... all the other villagers viewed me as a comrade.`
`Happiness and warmth...`
` I was acutely aware of those feelings as they gradually welled up inside of me.`
`"Sonozaki-sa~n.`
` The manager wants you to work the floor."`
`A more senior waitress waved her hand and called out to Shion.`
` ...It seemed like it was time for work.`
`"Ah, okay! I'm co~ming!`
` Sorry.`
` Looks like I have to get to work now."`
`"It's fine.`
` Thanks for hanging out with me, it was fun."`
`"...Oh ...Are you going home?"`
`"Yeah.`
` My mom gets fussy if I'm not home by dinner time."`
`It seemed that Shion wanted to say something, but she swallowed her words.`
` Like we hadn't talked enough, that kind of feeling.`
`Looking at that expression, I regretted saying something that had disappointed Mion like that.`
`I was about to say that I could stay for a little bit longer, when Shion got up from her seat.`
`"Here.`
` If you use the coupon it should cover the pancakes as well."`
`Saying that, she showed me a coupon booklet as she tore out a few sheets and handed them to me.`
`"Convenient, isn't it?`
` It's a perk I get on top of my salary."`
`"I-It's okay.`
` I can pay for the pancakes myself."`
`"Hey hey~.`
` Being so reserved doesn't fit you, Kei-chan.`
` If I were my sister you would have gladly let me pay for it!"`
`She said as she laughed, gently stopping me from opening my wallet.`
`Being told so with such an encouraging smile really resounded with me.`
`"Sonozaki-sa~n. Sorry, could you take care of the register~!"`
`"Ah, yes! Right away!"`
`Later! Today was fun.`
` Saying that, Shion smiled one more time at me.`
`"Oh, Mion!`
` Thanks a lot for today. I owe you one."`
`"If you really think that, then return the favor.`
` I'm looking forward to it!"`
`After I said it, I realized I mistakenly called her Mion.`
`I didn't know if she realized it or not.`
`Lazing around and watching television after dinner was part of my daily routine.`
`It might seem like a waste at first glance, but you could say it was an important time when I was able to accrue knowledge of everything from politics to economics to various trivia.`
`After dinner was valuable time well spent while the brain was at its most supplied with nutrients.`
`"You idiot! It's obvious that Tokyo Tower is taller!!`
` Ahhh!!"`
`Today I tested my knowledge of trivia by watching my weekly quiz show.`
`Sitting in front of the television, I was able to get a lot of the answers right.`
` ...But if I were actually up on stage, I'd probably fail miserably.`
`"Keiichi~.`
` Phone call from Sonozaki-san."`
`"Okay~.`
` ...Sonozaki?`
` That's Mion!"`
`It was a little late for her to be calling.`
` ...I had a bad feeling about this.`
` I had a hunch it was something to do with club activities.`
`She was probably going to inform me about what we were doing tomorrow.`
`...This *was* Mion we're talking about.`
`She might even go so far as to say we're doing club activities right now, so hurry up and come over.`
` By the way, it was 8 pm.`
`"Hello?`
` No way we're having a club battle right now!"`
`"Huh!?`
` ...That's not it...`
` I mean..."`
`It was Mion, but it was a very un-Mion-like way of talking.`
`...Huh? Could it be...?`
`"S-Sorry.`
` Could it be you're not Mion...`
` but Shion?"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Ummm... Good evening.`
` I'm sorry for calling so late."`
`For Mion, this would have been an ill-fittingly polite way of talking.`
` But since it was Shion, it was natural.`
`...Even though they were both the same person.`
`With a dry smile, I enjoyed that mysterious feeling.`
`"No, it's fine.`
` What's up?"`
`"Kei-chan, do you like sweets, like cakes or desserts?"`
`There was no way I hated them. I'm an unabashed glutton!`
`"That's great.`
` Actually, there's a new dessert contest this summer."`
`Looks like they have a new dessert menu every season.`
`So they were hiring taste-testers for potential desserts.`
`"The desserts at Angel Mort have a good reputation.`
` It's pretty difficult to get accepted as a taste-tester.`
` ...I'll get right to the point.`
` Ta-da~☆."`
`"You say 'Ta-da~' but I can't see over the phone. Still... could it be..."`
`"That's right!`
` I have a Taste-Testing Ticket right here.`
` If you don't mind sweets, how about it?"`
`"When you say 'how about it,' you basically mean...`
` With that ticket I can eat all the new desserts I want!?"`
`They say to beware of honeypots... but this is sweeter than any pot of honey!`
` All-you-can-eat free dessert? No way!`
`"If you're okay with that, I'll register you as a taste-tester.`
` When you come to the restaurant tomorrow, just give the person in charge your name.`
` Then everything'll work out."`
`"When you say everything'll work out... you mean all-you-can-eat!?`
` For free!?"`
`"Yeah, it's free.`
` There's quite a bit, so I recommend you come hungry."`
`This was such a delectable opportunity it was almost scary.`
`...This was really Shion, right?`
`It wasn't Mion posing as Shion in order to bait me into a trap, was it...?`
`...What am I saying...`
` They're the same person.`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I know exactly what you're thinking, Kei-chan.`
` You're thinking this is too good to be true, right?"`
`"Eep. I mean, I would never..."`
`"*snort*!`
` Hee hee hee hee...`
` I heard from my sister but... you're really somebody who can't tell a lie.`
` I'm not averse to somebody like that. ...Hehehe!"`
`Shion laughed with a voice that sounded a lot like how Mion would laugh.`
`"It's not like I was intending on it...`
` But it just so happens that my shift ends early tomorrow.`
` ...If it's not a bother, I thought maybe we could spend a little time together after I'm done."`
`"Hmmm... your shift ends early tomorrow?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So while you take your time eating dessert I'll finish up."`
`"Well... I didn't have any plans anyway.`
` I don't mind hanging out with you for a bit."`
`"It's not like we have to go anywhere.`
` I was thinking we could cool off in the evening while we take a walk."`
`There was no reason for me to refuse.`
`... Out of courtesy, I might as well take her up on her offer.`
`"By the way, Kei-chan... You and I have been meeting up every day, haven't we?"`
`"...Now that you say it, I guess we have."`
`"Since you said okay, we have an excuse to meet again tomorrow."`
`Huh??`
` Wh-What was Mion saying??`
`"Ahahahahaha! Kei-chan, your voice just cracked.`
` What's the matter?`
` *snicker*"`
`It wasn't a video-phone, but she could tell I was beet-red!`
`"Well then, you should definitely come tomorrow!`
` I'll take my leave here. Good night."`
`"G... Good night~."`
`Shion, finished with what she had called to say, ended the conversation without any chit-chat.`
`When I returned to the living room after hanging up the phone, the TV was already off and my mom was sleeping in the rocking chair.`
`Not feeling like turning the TV back on, I went back upstairs and returned to my room.`
`"I've only been receiving favors from Shion, haven't I...?"`
`She brought me a bento, and saved me when I got involved with those thugs.`
`She was supposed to be a different person, so I could thank Mion at school.`
` ...Come to think of it, she'd probably just say she'll pass it on to her sister.`
`I have to thank Shion directly...`
