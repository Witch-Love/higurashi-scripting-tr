`June 28, 1983.`
`A violent incident occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.`
`The victim was Keiichi Maebara, also a victim of the previous string of disappearances.`
`At around 2:00 AM, he was stabbed in the stomach with a bladed object by the suspect of the last case (Mion Sonozaki) and was gravely wounded.`
`He was discovered when his parents woke up, and was then transported to the clinic.`
` He escaped death.`
`The criminal fled the scene.`
`On the same day, at approximately the same time.`
`A fall accident occurred in the Kamiishiki apartment complex in Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.`
`The victim was Shion Sonozaki, also a victim of the previous string of disappearances.`
`Late on the same night, neighbors overheard her having a big fight with someone and informed the manager.`
`The manager used a master key to enter the room and discovered that the victim had fallen from her eighth-floor balcony to her death.`
`The room had been torn apart and appeared to show traces of a fight.`
`One neighbor has frequently visited the Sonozaki house for a long time, and testified that he heard what sounded just like the two sisters having a fight, trading insults back and forth.`
`We believed this was related to the injury case that occurred the same day in Hinamizawa Village, perpetrated by said incident's suspect,`
`and did a thorough search of the room, but we could not find any traces that would imply that anyone but the victim was present.`
`The victim fell straight down into the foliage of a parking strip.`
` Her neck broke and she died immediately.`
`Her clothing was disheveled, and had markings that would imply a scuffle.`
`...We also believe, however, that it could have been an insanity-induced suicide attempt, based on the particular mental state of the victim after the incident.`
`We are conducting a thorough examination on both fronts, suicide and homicide...`
`"......Only for five minutes, understand?`
` Please, try not to excite him."`
`"Yes, yes. I'll be careful."`
`Kaclack.`
`The door opened... and as I expected, Ooishi-san came in.`
`"Hello, hello, Maebara-san.`
` It's been a while, hasn't it?`
` Tell me, how have you been since then?"`
`"...The doctor says my post-operative recovery seems to be going smoothly... but I think I got worse when I saw your face."`
`"Nah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You wound me."`
`As Ooishi-san gave a laugh that smelled of sweat, he handed Mom a bag of assorted candies he must have purchased from the souvenir corner on the first floor of the hospital.`
`"Excuse me, Mrs. Maebara.`
` Would it be possible for me to talk to Keiichi-kun for just a few moments?"`
`Mom clearly wasn't pleased at the thought of a police officer talking to her son without her there.`
`...However, I insisted.`
`"......Mom.`
` Sorry, just a little while.`
` Just five minutes, okay?"`
`Though grudgingly, Mom left the room.`
`When she closed the door, Ooishi-san grinned widely and looked around the room.`
`"A room to yourself—how high class!`
` My old lady always gets a shared room, you know.`
` It is quite lively, however.`
` Seems like you're a higher rank if you have a worse disease in places like that. `
`The sicker you are, the prouder you are—or maybe the more arrogant..."`
`"...Ooishi-san, we only have five minutes.`
` I would like it if these were the last five minutes we ever saw each other.`
`......I don't have any connection to Hinamizawa anymore... and this isn't in Hinamizawa anymore either."`
`"...Yes, because there aren't any general hospitals in Okinomiya.`
` ...Mind if I take a seat?`
` Down we go."`
`This was a large university hospital in Shishibone City.`
`It was splendidly urban, entirely different from the likes of Hinamizawa and Okinomiya.`
`It was hard to believe Hinamizawa was part of the same city.`
`"When does it look like you'll get transferred?"`
`"Dunno.`
` ...I'm ready to go whenever, though."`
`Our moving plans were delayed a little because of my serious injury.`
`My parents had already left the house in Hinamizawa, though, and were living in our new one.`
`They planned to have me transfer hospitals to be closer to the new house once I'd recovered enough to be taken there.`
`"...Please, don't come to where I'm transferring.`
` I really will get worse then."`
`"Man... You really do hate me.`
` It may just be my job, but that stings.`
` That's why I brought you all kinds of lovely souvenirs in atonement."`
`"......You didn't need to bring an assortment of cookies for that."`
`"Well, you see...`
` There aren't actually cookies in there.`
` Look~"`
`Ooishi-san pulls open the can of cookies, and`
` ......`
`Nwahh?!`
` Ow, ow, I'm stretching my scar...`
`"Nfu-fu-fu!`
` I thought for sure a healthy young person like you would be feeling a little needy, being cooped up in a place like this for sooooo long. `
`If you stay here too long, the only fetish you'll end up with is a nurse one, you know.`
`There are plenty of other beautiful things in this world besides nurses, after all!`
` Don't decide what to major in now—keep your options open!`
` You need to be a more all-around type of person. `
`Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!!"`
`I gave Ooishi-san's vulgar laughter a pained grin.`
`...Somehow or other, I understood.`
`The fact that Ooishi-san was bringing it up like this...`
` meant that he must have had something important to talk about.`
`"............The incident with Shion-san really was unfortunate."`
`"............"`
`The night I was stabbed by Mion.`
`Shion fell from her balcony and died.`
`...They said the police were investigating all possibilities—accident, suicide, and homicide—but it could only have been Mion's doing...`
`Mion found out where Shion was hiding... and pushed her down to her death.`
` Nothing else was conceivable.`
`"............It couldn't have been an accident.`
` ......It was Mion.`
` ...It had to be."`
`"......The criminology guys are saying it had to be a suicide, but I'm of the same opinion as you, Maebara-san.`
` ...She pushed Shion-san, and also stabbed you.`
` ...In one night."`
`"............`
`Has Mion...`
` still not been found?"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` That's what I came here to tell you today.`
` ...Yes.`
` We actually did find her."`
`"What?!`
` ......Ow, ow ow ow..."`
`...Learning that... felt rather strange to me.`
`I was partly relieved that the incident was truly over... and I was partly sorry that my best friend had finally been caught.`
` ...I felt many other things, too...`
` ...My heart was a maze of emotions.`
`"That's not all.`
` In the Sonozaki house catacombs.`
` ...We found a hidden well.`
`Just as you said, Maebara-san, we found the remains of all those who disappeared at the bottom."`
`"............I...`
` see..."`
`...That sliver of hope, that possibility I'd believed in... that Rika-chan and Satoko were alive... just from the fact their remains hadn't been found...`
` gone.`
`"It was incredibly well-hidden in those catacombs.`
` I mean, it was in the blind spot of another blind spot.`
`It was a vertical tunnel, dug out like a well.`
` ...There was a ladder set up there, and when we went aaaaall the way down, there was another tunnel built there going through it. `
`...When we followed it a few hundred meters, we found ourselves at the mouth of an old unused well in the mountains."`
`"......I wonder if it was a secret escape route a previous Sonozaki family leader built."`
`"Probably was.`
` ...Maybe it was made in the Meiji era.`
` Still... I'm impressed they built something like that."`
`".........`
`So everyone's remains......`
` were at the bottom...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...Even deeper down than the escape path, there was a pool of coal tar.`
` They'd been casually thrown into there.`
`They had fallen from a fairly high spot, so their remains were totally buried in it.`
` ...It took a lot of time and effort to pull their bodies up."`
`"............`
`Did you...`
` find them all?"`
`I hoped... that they at least wouldn't find Rika-chan or Satoko.`
`...That's what I wished for when I asked, but my shallow hope was crushed in the blink of an eye.`
`"Yes.`
` All of them.`
` ...In fact, we also found human bones we think are over a decade old.`
` We think there are at least three people.`
` ...I suppose it's the dark side of Hinamizawa's history. `
`I wonder how many people's bones... we'll find when we've sucked out all the mud.`
` ...It's a scary thought."`
`............That weight had been pushing down on Mion's shoulders the whole time.`
`......Mion.`
` ............`
`"...We've currently identified people who disappeared from Shishibone City decades ago. `
`...People are talking about how this opportunity might let us resolve the disappearing persons cases that have been abandoned."`
`"............"`
`After a deep silence...... he breathed a heavy sigh...`
`Ooishi-san went for his cigarettes to pass the time, but realized this was a non-smoking area, so he gave up and put them back in his shirt pocket.`
`"Oh, right.`
` ...This is a bit of a detour......`
` but you know Rika Furude-san, right?"`
`"Of course.`
` ...She's my friend."`
`"Did she ever tell you anything along the lines of her regularly taking insulin injections for diabetes?"`
`..........??`
` Rika-chan has diabetes???`
` I didn't know what he was talking about.`
`"Actually, we found it in her skirt pocket.`
` A syringe.`
` It was destroyed, though, so we couldn't identify the medicine.`
` ...It was a bit out of place, so I got interested.`
` ...You really don't know anything?"`
`......I didn't know anything about Rika-chan carrying syringes around with her.`
`"No, not at all... That isn't what I'm saying.`
`...It just seems strange however you look at it... that she would bring a syringe with her on her way to get soy sauce."`
`............I have no idea... what any of this means.`
`My eyes are spinning...`
` ...I feel sick..............`
`"Are you all right?`
` Should I call a nurse?"`
`"I... I'm fine.`
` ...Please continue..."`
`"Well, that's all I had to say about the syringe.`
` It was the only thing that personally struck me as interesting."`
`............Rika-chan...`
`"...Rika-san was sort of like the village mascot, after all.`
` ...It looks like the village is in an uproar right now.`
` ...Between the older blind believers, and the Sonozaki family who killed her.`
`The Three Families' effective control over the village is basically in shambles, too.`
`.........If someone came up to them with talk of a dam again, with this sort of timing, the entire village would be abandoned for sure this time."`
`"......I'm not... related to Hinamizawa anymore."`
`I actually was.`
`...I just said it because the thought about Hinamizawa being abandoned was unpleasant... and I wanted to end the conversation quickly.`
`There was a knock at the door.`
`It opened slightly, and my mom asked if we were still talking.`
`"Whoops!`
` We went off topic, didn't we?`
` ...What a pickle!"`
`............I looked at the clock.`
` ...Five minutes were long past.`
`He told my mother that there was something he really wanted to ask, and if she could wait a little bit longer.`
`"...Is that so?`
` Keep it short, okay?"`
`There wasn't any getting around the fact that she was thinking about what a police officer could be talking to her son about.`
`".........Maybe we should choose another day for this."`
`"...Umm... Ooishi-san.`
` .........Mion...`
` How is she right now?"`
`I wanted to just hear that answer and then get rid of him.`
`"............Before I tell you that, I just need one thing from you.`
` ...I just need you to answer something in all honesty."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"...............I want you to take your answer seriously, got it?`
` ...If you say something indiscreet, it could be viewed as an obstruction of the investigation, and you could be prosecuted."`
`...Ooishi-san kept threatening me until the end.`
`...What the hell did he want?`
`"......Maebara-san.`
` ...Who do you think the criminal was who pushed Shion from the balcony?"`
`"............There's no way it could be anyone but Mion, is there?"`
`"Then who was the one who stabbed you?"`
`"............Please don't make me say it again.`
` ...It was Mion.`
` ...Mion Sonozaki."`
`......Ooishi-san smiled bitterly, then dabbed at his forehead with a handkerchief to wipe his sweat.`
`He should have expected that answer, and yet it looked as though he wasn't satisfied with it.`
`"She pushed Shion, and stabbed me.`
` ...Didn't you just admit yourself that Mion was the criminal?"`
`"...The evidence we have that Mion killed Shion is based on testimony from the man living next door.`
`...This neighbor is actually a member of an organized crime group—in other words, he was Shion-san's bodyguard. `
`It seems he's a veteran leader in that vein, and was like a parent to the Sonozaki sisters growing up."`
`...That man said this.`
`The noise he heard from next door was just like the sound of a fight between the sisters that he was used to hearing when they still lived together...`
` and no, there was no doubt about it.`
`He said he heard Mion and Shion insulting each other, and heard them struggling.`
`At first, though, he thought it was a hallucination she was having, brought on by her dementia.`
`...You see, he thought that because that sort of ruckus... had been occurring every night.`
`However, that night... had been longer than the rest, and he claimed that he went to her room to give her a sedative.`
`The noise died down while he got the manager to give him the key.`
`He'd already decided he'd at least check up on her, and after she wasn't answering his calls, they took the plunge and unlocked the door.`
`Then they saw that the room was a mess.`
`...Since Shion had been pushed over the balcony, they decided it had to have been Mion...`
` and that's how it happened.`
`"...In other words, he only heard from the other side of the wall.`
` Plus, because the apartment complex is connected to their organization, it doesn't have many residents. `
`So they were the only ones who heard it happening.`
` ...To reiterate, there was only one person who witnessed Mion Sonozaki."`
`"Even if he didn't see her... that's... isn't it obviously Mion's doing...?!"`
`"Now, settle down.`
` ...This is what I'm saying.`
` ...It means you are the only one who saw Mion Sonozaki for sure last night.`
` After all, Shion-san, the other witness, is no longer alive."`
`"............What are you trying to say?`
` ...I don't really understand..."`
`At that point, Ooishi-san paused.`
`The fact that this was a no-smoking area completely slipped his mind, and he took out his pack of cigarettes again.`
`Ker-chack. He lit one with his lighter...`
` ...and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke...`
`"......Were you really stabbed by Mion Sonozaki?"`
`"Yes.`
` ............There's no doubt about it."`
`"............"`
`The smoke Ooishi-san breathed out floated away... like a thundercloud swept away by the wind.`
`".........Ooishi-san, you can't smoke in here.`
` ...The nurses will get mad."`
`"Actually...`
` We found Mion Sonozaki at the bottom of the well too."`
`"............What?"`
`"She fell to her death.`
` We believe that as she was trying to escape to that hidden passage in the well, her foot slipped while climbing down the ladder...`
` she fell to the bottom,`
` broke her neck, and died.`
` ...Yes. `
`The same way as Shion-san.`
` She broke her neck."`
`"...Um, well...`
` .................What......?"`
`"After you passed out that day, Mion Sonozaki tried to escape using the hidden well...`
` ......but her foot slipped and she died.`
` ...As if beckoned by the corpses of the other sacrifices she dropped down there."`
`"...............`
` But...`
` That doesn't make any sense, does it...?"`
`"The autopsy came to the conclusion that she definitely died on that day.`
`...She didn't go back there after attacking you and Shion-san.`
` ...She was already dead by then."`
`My jaw... was on the floor.`
`...There was absolutely... no way that could be.`
`...Mion was the one that stabbed me... It had to have been her.`
`...There wouldn't have been... anyone else to do it.........`
`"Then...`
` then...`
` wh-who attacked Shion and me...?!`
` Who was it...?!"`
`"The one who attacked you... was someone who was Mion Sonozaki, and yet not Mion Sonozaki."`
`......My mind had become a complete mess... and I was starting to lose my ability to think straight...`
`"...Do you remember how Miyo Takano-san died?"`
`"Eh?`
` ...Takano-san?`
` Ah... yes.`
`......I think I heard that she was... burned to death in some distant mountains..."`
`"We learned that she was burned after being strangled to death.`
` ...The Gifu station did the autopsy.`
` It's a little bit strange.`
`...The results of the preliminary autopsy said that she had been dead for at least twenty-four hours.`
` Since that was contradictory, in their panic they seem to have revised it to say she died earlier that day."`
`...Despite me being an absolute wreck over what was going on with Mion...`
` he was telling me...... there was even more on top of that......?`
`.........I didn't understand the complex things Ooishi-san was telling me...`
`"The result saying she had been dead for twenty-four hours, as our own old criminologist says...`
` is pretty damn reliable.`
` ...So then what would that mean?`
`...I've asked that question over and over...`
` but on the night of Watanagashi...`
` you were with Miyo Takano-san, weren't you?"`
`"......I was."`
`"You also met her on the day before, while setting up for the festival, right?`
` I mean, I ran into her too."`
`"......Yes.`
` ...I was with her then."`
`"If she'd been dead for twenty-four hours...`
` then that would mean she was already dead the day before the festival."`
`"............Haha...`
` that can't be..."`
`"......She was alive during the festival preparations.`
`However... when you all slipped into the ritual storehouse...`
` Takano-san was already dead."`
`The origin of all that happened.`
` The beginning of everything.`
`...Our intrusion in the ritual storehouse... which I had come to regret countless times.`
`The one who tempted me...`
` ...............`
`Takano-san.`
`When she... invited us into the storehouse... she was already... no longer of this world...`
`"There are too many dead people walking around in this incident.`
` ...Na-ha-ha..."`
`...............An incident...`
` caused by a dead person...`
` and ended by a dead person.`
`"...Also, apparently they're under pressure to revise the time of Mion Sonozaki's death not to the day of the incident, but to right after she stabbed you. `
`......Probably pressure from the outside, to get this incident wrapped up already.`
` ...So I'd appreciate it if you didn't say a word about this to anyone."`
`Ooishi-san grabbed his jacket that was hanging on the chair, put out his cigarette with the bottom of his foot, and started pretending to wave away the smoke floating around.`
`"I've stayed too long.`
`...I had come here thinking I could at least end this incident as it applied to you, but...`
` ...it looks like it got even more baffling instead."`
`Absent-mindedly... he walked towards the door... looking at me, unable to speak, out of the corner of his eye.`
`"......If it so happens...`
` that something comes up you want to talk about in the future, call me anytime.`
` My business card is in those souvenirs from before. `
`...When that time comes, I'll pay you a visit with some wonderful souvenirs again.`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`Ooishi-san... seemed to think I was still hiding something.`
`That I... after all this... would be hiding something...?`
`I'm the one things are being hidden from.`
` ...I'm the one who wants to know.`
`"Then let us meet again one day.`
` Take care of yourself."`
`Slam.`
`I listened... to the tap tap tap... of Ooishi-san walking down the hallway.`
` ...I still couldn't return from my state of bewilderment.`
`He wanted to end this incident as it applied to me...?`
`What was over?`
`Nothing was over.`
`...The incident...`
` was still...`
` continuing...`
`......Then, slip... an arm covered in fresh blood...`
` came out from underneath the bed.`
`...I wasn't that surprised.`
`...This was... an illusion I was seeing, seized with fear...`
`<i>...Kei-chan...`
` I told you, remember...</i>`
`I heard a... guttural voice coming from under the bed.`
` ...I still recognized it as Mion's voice.`
`"...What, Mion?`
` ......What did you tell me...?"`
`<i>...I...`
` warned you on that day...</i>`
`<i>...After today...`
` if you see me......`
` it will be the demon...`
` that has possessed my body......</i>`
`"...Ahahaha...`
` You did... You said that, didn't you?`
` ......Sorry.`
` ...Guess I wasn't careful enough.`
` ......That's why I got stabbed.`
` ...Ahahahaha..."`
`Possibly wounds sustained when she fell from the ladder...`
` many of her fingernails... were broken and torn...`
`Her arm... slowly felt about on top of the bed... searching for mine.`
`"Oh... hey...`
` Mion.`
` ...I...`
` just, well,`
` thought of a good joke.`
` ...Want to hear it?"`
`............The Mion under the bed didn't answer.`
`"L-Let's say......`
` ......that I...`
` died here today...`
` ...but... tomorrow, I'd still be here, living a normal life.`
` ......So...... when Ooishi-san learned about it afterwards...`
` the time of death wouldn't make sense, once again! `
`He'd make a huge deal about how someone who should have died was alive... and he'd totally lose his head!`
` Takano-san, then Mion, and then me third.`
` ...So?!`
` Funny, right?`
` Makes you laugh, doesn't it? `
`Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`<i>............Kei-chan...............</i>`
`"...Laugh.`
` ...Or was it n-not that funny...?"`
`Mion's bloodstained hand... groped around... and found my wrist.`
`Though her fingernails were torn... she gripped it hard... as if scratching me......`
`"Ow... ow, ow...`
` G-Go easy......`
` Ow... It hurts..."`
`<i>...Kei-chan................`
` I've come for you......</i>`
`I tried to shake my wrist loose... but the strength she held it with was unbelievable, and I couldn't.`
`She was only gripping one wrist... and yet my whole body wouldn't move.`
`...I couldn't even twitch.`
`My fingers were spread apart... and I couldn't make a fist, either......`
`.........And that...... fact that I couldn't make a fist... reminded me of the restraining table..............`
`...............!!!!`
`I felt... a crooked nail press against my left pinky fingertip.`
`...Mion's forehead was split open... and with a face covered with blood... she smiled...`
` and got right up... just behind me...`
`"......Nothing was over.`
` ......Nothing was over.`
`This incident was far from being over.`
`...It was still going on.`
`It was still happening.`
`Someone, please end this incident.`
`This cruel, tragic, unfortunate, sad incident...`
` Please, end it.`
`That...`
` is my only wish..."`
`"I granted you one`
` before, remember?`
` You don't get any more.`
` ......Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`Mion firmly held the nail down on my fingertip.`
`...And, with her other hand, she slowly swung a mallet up into the air, and.................`
