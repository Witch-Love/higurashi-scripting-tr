`I was on my way back home.`
`......The cries of the higurashi accentuated the already-lonely evening.`
`...More time had passed than I'd thought.`
`The orange of the dusky sky was being chased down, little by little, by an indigo color approaching from the east.`
`Exhausted from the slow climb towards Hinamizawa... without even noticing, I'd gotten off my bicycle and was pushing it uphill.`
`"............"`
`I don't understand any of this...`
`...No one had told me to my face that I'd done something wrong.`
`...No... In fact, it might have been much easier on me that way.`
`What happened yesterday... really was just my curiosity.`
`...It really was no more than a quiet prank... no more than having the courage to cross at a red light as long as you did it with other people.`
`The storehouse for ritual implements—hallowed ground, only accessible to the family of the priest.`
`For sure, I'd seen terrifying things that I'd never imagined would be there.`
`...Thinking on it now, though, it didn't matter what was stored away inside—it didn't make the wrong I had committed any more right.`
`...What the four of us did... Mion seemed to know about it.`
`...For some reason, even the police were trying to learn what the four of us did.`
`Did we do... something so bad......?`
`Really...`
`...It doesn't matter how wrong it was.`
`...I did something wrong.`
` It was nothing more than that, and yet...`
`I couldn't accept it. I didn't apologize to Mion or Ooishi-san—all I did was shield myself with ambiguities...`
`I did something wrong yesterday.`
`...I set foot into a forbidden storehouse for a little bit of mischief.`
`I'll forget everything I saw in there.`
`I won't ever do something like that again, either.`
`...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.`
`If I apologize like that... would they forgive me...?`
`The suddenly cool evening air left no room for such sentiment, however, as it mercilessly chilled my feet, urging me to head home as soon as possible...`
`...In the end, the evening air was correct.`
`If I trudged along such an isolated road, regrets would pile on top of regrets, but nothing would change.`
`Let's go home.`
`I'll go home, go to my room, put on my favorite music or something, and go to bed.`
`...That might sound plain and boring, but it's probably the strongest I've felt all day.`
`"............Hoo..."`
`Now that I've made a decision, there's no point in dawdling in a place like this.`
` I sat back on my bike.`
`I pushed hard on the pedals.`
`I rapidly advanced forward.`
`I steadily gained speed.`
`The wind was cutting and mercilessly cold, but it actually felt good, as if it were softly punishing me...`
`I didn't eat much dinner before excusing myself early and returning to my bedroom.`
`My mom called me from downstairs.`
`"Keiichi~`
` You have a call!`
` It's from Sonozaki-san!"`
`Sonozaki?`
` Was it Mion?`
`...No, it was Shion.`
`...I just remembered.`
`She'd had something she wanted to tell me today.`
`Ooishi-san had interrupted us, so she didn't get the chance.`
` ...Shion had said she'd call tonight...`
`"Hello?`
` ...Is that you, Shion?"`
`"Hello.`
` Ran into a bit of trouble today, didn't we?"`
`She said it so plainly that I got a bit annoyed.`
` ...She was the one who left me there and ran.`
`"Don't say that.`
` I gave you the signal to run away with me, didn't I?`
` You just sat there looking dazed, Kei-chan."`
`"I-I wasn't dazed!`
` ...All of a sudden you left me there, and after that, I had to put up with that Ooishi guy for ages!"`
`"Don't complain to me about it."`
`...I-I can't believe she passed it off like that!`
`She looks just like Mion, and yet inside, she's this different?`
`...I got a little irritated at myself when I realized I was, somewhere in my mind, hoping for the same reaction I would get from Mion, even though she's a different person.`
`"...Uh... sorry.`
` Next time I'll run away first thing and leave you there."`
`"Hey, it's ladies first. Ahahahahaha!"`
`Shion laughed refreshingly.`
`...When I heard her voice, I realized that she wasn't really that angry or anything.`
`...It was just as she said.`
`...The cause of my temper was because it was my own fault for not leaving immediately.`
`...I'll stop blaming it on others.`
` Blaming it on others would be...`
`"Anyway... You had something to tell me, right?"`
`"Oh, yeah.`
` .........I mean, if you already know, then it's not something that bears repeating.`
` ...Umm...`
` ...Do you already know?"`
`Shion lowered her voice suddenly, as if she were glancing around.`
`...I had no idea what I could already know.`
`"...Sorry, but I have no clue what you're talking about.`
` At least give me a hint."`
`"......So that means...`
` ...you don't know."`
`She seemed to take my stupid-sounding question as evidence.`
`However, her voice didn't sound disappointed or exasperated in the slightest.`
`"Actually,`
` ...It's about last night, during the Watanagashi Festival."`
`My entire body jolted as I was assailed by a terrible feeling...`
`...I-Is Shion... going to ask the same thing...?!`
`"Hello?`
` Kei-chan, are you listening...?"`
`"...Uh... yeah.`
` I am.`
` ...What about last night?"`
`"The four of us... went in there, right?"`
`...She didn't beat around the bush.`
`Whether or not I wanted to admit it... that was the actual, honest truth, and I couldn't act like it hadn't happened...`
`"Then, after that, we walked away together... and then went our separate ways near the stone stairs, right?`
` Takano-san and Tomitake-san went to the stream, and you stayed there, Kei-chan. `
`I went over to see some relatives."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Why do you ask?"`
`"......We won't make any progress if we keep asking each other questions... so let me ask this question first.`
` Okay?"`
`"You mean... did I see Tomitake-san and Takano-san last night?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ...Oh, yes.`
` ...Did you see the two of them after that?"`
`...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised.`
`...This is the third time I've been asked this question today.`
`Why?`
` Why?`
` What the hell was going on?!`
`"W-Why?!`
` Why are you asking me that?!"`
`"No, Kei-chan!`
` I'm asking the question.`
` Please answer me."`
`"D-Did you, Shion?`
` If you answer first, then I'll answer...!"`
`My shabby response betrayed how scared and small I felt now... after everything that had happened today.`
`Shion didn't say anything for a few moments.`
`...Just as I was beginning to think I'd really put my foot in my mouth with that response, she finally answered me.`
`"Of course, I didn't see them.`
` My relatives were with me, and they can vouch for that."`
`"...I didn't see them either.`
` People can vouch for me, too—like Mion, Rena, and everyone else."`
`Now that we knew our answers matched, she let out a sigh that sounded more relieved than anything else...`
`"Thank you for answering me honestly.`
` ...Okay, then... I'll tell you.`
`...Apparently, last night, Takano-san and Tomitake-san died."`
`"......Sorry, Shion.`
` ...What was that you just said?"`
`"Apparently, last night, Takano-san and Tomitake-san died.`
` Takano-san was found burned to death.`
` Tomitake-san was... well, it looked like a suicide.`
` ...I found out this morning. `
`...I heard my dad talking to a relative on the phone about it..."`
`Late last night.`
`A police car on its way back from festival security duty had discovered Tomitake-san lying in the middle of the road heading towards Okinomiya.`
`He had... clawed out his throat,`
` and died.`
`"W-What? He... clawed out his own throat?`
` Th-That bright, cheerful Tomitake-san committed suicide?!`
` That can't possibly be right!!"`
`"The police did an autopsy!`
` He did it with his own fingernails!`
` He scratched at his throat so hard that he ruptured his blood vessels and bled out!`
` He died in a pool of his own blood, that's what they said!!"`
`"I've never heard of such an insane suicide!!`
` You can't just... scratch open your own throat like that!!"`
`I realized I was yelling too loudly, so I lowered the force I was putting into my voice...`
`I didn't want my parents to hear me, so I switched to the cordless phone and ran up to my own room.`
`"...Sorry for yelling.`
` ...So?`
` Was Takano-san... was that a suicide too?"`
`"In her case... it's a little unclear......"`
`Takano-san's body was found in the mountains of Gifu Prefecture.`
`Employees at a rest stop nearby reported to the police late that night that they could see flames in the mountains.`
`The firefighters dispatched there were the first ones to find her.`
`An autopsy concluded that it was the burned corpse of a half-naked female.`
`They initially considered the body beyond recognition, but directly after, there was a request for a dental comparison from the ×× prefectural police station in Okinomiya, and the results concluded that it was Miyo Takano.`
`The cause of death wasn't confirmed, but it was highly likely to have been a homicide, since she was in her undergarments, and her clothes were nowhere in the area.`
`"...The oil drum had fallen over, so it's also possible she burned herself to death."`
`"I-It couldn't possibly have been suicide!!`
` If you're going to die, there are plenty of easier ways, aren't there?!`
` This is... this can't be suicide!!"`
`"That's what I think!`
` It's unthinkable that Tomitake-san would kill himself, too!"`
`After the two us rattled on at each other, there was a silence as we paused to catch our breaths.`
`...And as we calmed our nerves...`
` right then, I understood what Shion's story actually meant...`
`"...I think it will end up being Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` We all did more than enough to deserve it, after all."`
`"D-Deserve...? Y-You've gotta be kidding!!`
` It's not like I...!!"`
`Shion wanted to see it with me! I just went along with her!!`
` ...I tried to say that, but I fell silent.`
`...Nothing would come of me blaming others.`
`...It didn't matter how much everyone else encouraged me... I could have put my foot down.`
`I lost to my own half-assed sense of adventure and agreed to go in with them`
`......`
` Yes, it was my fault, and no one else's...`
`"......Shion.`
` ...Last night, when we snuck into the ritual storehouse, did you predict things would turn out this way...?"`
`"...Of course not.`
` I mean, I thought it was pretty risky... but I never even dreamed something like this could happen."`
`Shion's words were probably her true feelings.`
`...She knew she could get in trouble if we were caught, but that was the thrill of this little adventure.`
` ...It was the same for me.`
`"Besides that, Kei-chan.`
` ...Think about it for a moment.`
` ...Didn't Oyashiro-sama's curse turn out a little strange this year?"`
`...It was already plenty strange, seeing as how Tomitake-san and Takano-san died like that.`
`Given all that, what could possibly be stranger...?`
`"I mean that they found two corpses.`
` ...Remember what I said?`
` Every other year, one person would die, and one person would disappear.`
` ...This year is the first time two people have been found dead."`
`"...That may be true... but that's not a huge deal, is it?"`
`"It is, Kei-chan.`
` ...Think about it harder.`
` Listen.`
` If two people died because of Oyashiro-sama's curse,`
` then in order to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger, two people would need to be sacrificed."`
`"...Is that how it works...?`
` So what?`
` Tomitake-san and Takano-san died, so now two people are going to go missing this year...?"`
`...I don't understand why, but...`
`...When I said that, I felt my spine freeze.`
`"...I don't think anyone's been confirmed missing yet.`
` ...I think that those two people,`
` ...have yet to disappear..."`
`Shion, like me...was obviously getting the same feeling crawling down her back.`
`"Two people... have yet to`
` disappear......?"`
`Shion didn't answer.`
`I couldn't say any more than that, either.`
`...A chill crept in through my clothes and tried to wrap into a fist around my heart... cold hands, feeling about on my chest...`
`"............"`
`Neither of us could say anything.`
`Tomitake-san opened the lock, and he died. Takano-san exposed the ritual storehouse, and she died.`
`...If two more people were to be sacrificed...`
`Then... they would be... none other than the ones who entered with them... none other than us...`
`".........No.`
` ...This has... got to be a joke."`
`I wanted so much for her to pass this off as a joke, even now.`
` ...That, though, was such an incredibly difficult and selfish request.`
`If Tomitake-san and Takano-san had died in a common way like a car accident, I could tell myself it was coincidence.`
`...Instead... he clawed out his own throat... and she burned to death, drowned in oil, in the mountains... `
`...The two deaths were so out-of-the-ordinary... that I couldn't possibly dismiss it as mere coincidence.`
`It was as if... in exchange for sneaking into the ritual storehouse,`
` there must be someone punishing us... some sort of cruel will working behind the scenes.`
`...Even so... I still didn't want to accept that terrifying truth.`
`...If I did, then I would have to acknowledge that a horrible crisis was growing near for Shion and I...`
`...That's why I argued against it.`
` ...I argued, knowing I was running away.`
`"I... In the first place... it's not even in the newspaper, is it?!`
` Such a monstrous incident would be all over the newspapers and television!! `
`Magazine writers would flood the village, too, thinking it'd make for an interesting story...!!"`
`"Of course it's not getting reported by the media.`
` ...That's how it was in the past, too."`
`When the incidents occurred for the third year in a row, there were some third-rate magazines that sniffed out the story and ran issues full of gossip columns about Hinamizawa.`
`Fearing that the region would develop a negative stigma, they negotiated with the prefecture and the police.`
`...Since last year, it became a big conspiracy, where no information about the incidents was allowed to be leaked to the media...`
`"I hear the elders and the top brass from the Sonozaki family put all the pressure they could on the police."`
`"Then you mean... their deaths... are going to be dealt with in total secrecy?!"`
`"That's how it is.`
` ...Of course, the police are investigating it.`
` That's being performed in secret too, though, so I hear the investigation itself is very restricted in what it can and can't do. `
`You could essentially say they're interfering with a police investigation."`
`...This story was unbelievable.`
`...People died... and yet they don't publicize it and deal with everything in secret...`
`"If we break it down further...`
` it means that no matter who dies on the night of Watanagashi, it won't go public."`
`"...Th-That's the biggest pile of bullshit I've ever heard...!"`
`"Kei-chan.`
` ...Before, I said how the villagers could be the ones carrying out Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ...That's what I mean. `
`...At some point, a tradition was created here in Hinamizawa...`
` where every year, you're allowed to kill someone on the night of Watanagashi under the guise of it being Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`When someone dies on the night of Watanagashi... it turns into the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The curse turns into the serial murder incidents.`
`...In order to avoid exacerbating the negative stigma surrounding Hinamizawa... those incidents are dealt with in secret...`
`"That's insane!!`
` Dead and missing people turn up every year!!`
` However bad the stigma gets, the police have to draw the line somewhere, don't they?!"`
`"...You could say the incidents happening every year is mysterious, but the police can get the job done when they need to.`
`After all, the incidents always get resolved individually.`
` ...It doesn't end up being a 'string of incidents,' you know?`
` It just so happens that something unfortunate happens on the night of Watanagashi every year. `
`...That's all it turns into."`
`Most of the criminals responsible for the original dismemberment were arrested.`
`The last one managed to get and stay away... but the events were totally exposed and elucidated, so it was, in essence, resolved.`
`The dam-supporting couple who died in an accident on the second year—that was an accidental death, plain and simple.`
`...They made a lot of investigations into the possibility of it having been a homicide, but they didn't turn up anything.`
` It ended up as an accident.`
` It was resolved.`
`On the third year, the priest fell ill and passed away.`
`There were doctors present at the hospital at his deathbed, and they all had trustworthy medical certificates.`
`They even did an autopsy.`
`It concluded that it wasn't a homicide.`
` ...That was resolved, too.`
`On the fourth year, the sister-in-law of the dam-supporting couple was murdered.`
`The criminal was an abnormal man with a history of regular psychostimulant usage.`
`He confessed that he thought Oyashiro-sama's curse was so interesting he wanted to try it out.`
`The criminal died of an accident while imprisoned, so this incident was essentially resolved as well.`
`...That's right.`
`None of the incidents had any relation to another, and each was independently resolved...`
`"So then why does an unfortunate coincidence occur every year on the night of Watanagashi?`
` ...You can try and say it's a string of related incidents, but they're not related. `
`...Yet, every year, someone always dies, and someone always disappears!"`
`The story Takano-san told me on the day before during the setup... now that the curse really had occurred this year, I couldn't just laugh it off.`
`"......Then... ...does that mean... ...it'll come for us too...? `
`Just like how one person dies and one disappears every year... are you saying we'll be... taken along with Tomitake-san and Takano-san and erased too...?!"`
`...My lips had, at some point, become completely dry... and just saying that was... difficult.`
`Shion didn't respond.`
`...Her silence, however, was the clearest form of confirmation she could give me.`
`"...We... I mean, sure, we went somewhere we shouldn't have...`
` ...but we were just looking, right?`
` We didn't steal anything or take anything out... and we didn't tell anyone that we looked, right...?"`
`I was already regretting having committed such a wrong...`
`Even so... was it really so bad... that Tomitake-san and Takano-san deserved such cruel deaths?!`
`"...Besides, I didn't care about anything I saw in there at all!`
`Takano-san was the only one getting so happy over it, wasn't she?!`
` Takano-san was the only one at fault!!`
` I don't have anything to do with this!! `
`I'm not interested, I'm not involved, I don't give a shit about what was in there!!!"`
`I knew saying so wouldn't solve anything.`
`I could feel myself, my cold self in the innermost depths of my heart, disgusted at my pointless howling.`
` ...However... my emotions had broken through the dam, and I couldn't stop them anymore.`
`"I didn't have any interest in any of this from the start, damn it!!!`
` All I wanted to do was watch Rika-chan's performance!!`
` You were the one who pulled me away from that, weren't you, Shion?!?! `
`I don't give a rat's ass whether those two were trying to steal something or try to meet up secretly or whatever!!!`
` That's right! You're the one who made me go in there in the first place, Shion!!`
`You were all, 'Kei-chan, you need to see what's inside,' and you convinced me and then pulled me in!!!`
` Why the hell did you do that?!?!`
` I didn't have anything to do with this!!!`
` What will you do? `
`What are you going to do, damn it?!`
` How are you going to take responsibility for this?!?!`
` Huh?!`
` Hey, are you listeni......... agh!"`
`Click.`
`Without any warning, the phone cut off with the soft sound of a receiver being slammed down.`
`...Shion was just as terrified as I was...... I just said some really self-centered things...`
`My riled-up emotions disappeared as if they'd never existed, and in their place surged waves of deep regret at having run my mouth so irresponsibly.`
`I could try to call out Shion's name from beyond the disconnected phone... but it was too late.`
`.........What have I...`
` ......done?`
`...Shion was only trying to tell me as much as she could about this 'thing' about to descend upon us...`
`...As for me, I... could only whine like a child about it...`
`I went to call her back, but then remembered she lived in Okinomiya.`
`...I didn't know her phone number.`
`.........Since I had declared to Mion that I hadn't seen Shion last night, I couldn't just call Mion and ask her for Shion's phone number... I was too scared.`
`...I couldn't even call her back...!`
`I was stricken with hopeless regret...`
`......I returned the receiver to its stand, and I simply prayed... that Shion would call me back again.`
`Please, Shion......`
`......Calm down... and call me again......!`
`Ring ring ring ring ring...`
`"H-Hello, this is Maebara!!"`
`I swept up the receiver as though it wouldn't go through if I didn't grab it at that exact moment.`
`"No, it isn't.`
` ...If you need Dad, I'll go call him."`
`I went to put the receiver back down, but the caller stopped me hurriedly.`
`"...No, nobody's here at the moment."`
`Clack.`
`...I don't know who that was, but what if Shion tried to call while I was on the phone?! ...I thought, bubbling with egotistic anger.`
`Hey, wait......`
` Give it a break, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...These are the selfish emotions that made Shion mad at me, aren't they...?`
`...The more I thought about it,  though, the more I thought that Shion...`
` ...had given up hope in the short time since we had our conversation, and didn't want to call anymore...`
`Calm yourself, Keiichi Maebara...`
`...If Shion does call again, then first, apologize in a calm voice...`
`...If you do that, then Shion should understand...`
`............`
`However... no matter how long I waited...`
`...The phone didn't ring again that night...`
