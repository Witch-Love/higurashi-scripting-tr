`"Thank you very much for enjoying Higurashi When They Cry: Watanagashi!`
` How did you like the story this time?`
` If you enjoyed it even a little, I'm happy."`
`"A little, nothing!`
` Not again!`
` It was a huge bad ending again, was it not?!`
` It is enough to make me simply furious!"`
`"......I'm furious."`
`"Well, err, good work, everyone~!!`
` Well, hmm?`
` That's how it ended, but don't you think this story was kind of like a 'Mion Chapter'?`
` I'm extremely satisfied with how big a role I played! Nya-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`"Y-Y-You cannot call such a thing a success!!`
` Rika and I got killed too, didn't we?!"`
`"......None of this concerned Satoko at all, either."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!`
` I didn't want to die like that~!!"`
`"Now, now, don't cry!`
` There was a story centering around Mii-chan, so there will probably be one that centers around Satoko-chan, too.`
` Look forward to it!"`
`"I'm sure that in that story, Satoko suffers some terrible demise in some slow, deliberate way~"`
`"Waaaaaahhhhh!!`
` I don't want thaaaaat~!!!`
` Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!"`
`"Mii~chan.`
` If you joke around too much, you'll make me angry, too~"`
`"......Mii has a flat chest.`
` ...Your mind wouldn't understand even if it wanted to be petted."`
`"Oh, they expanded.`
` ...Your body is so unchaste..."`
`"Hey, everyone!`
` Great work!"`
`"Sorry we're late again. Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`"Tomitake-san, Ooishi-san!`
` Yes, you did a great job as well.`
` Hm?`
` Where are Takano-san and Shion-chan?"`
`"They're coming, of course.`
` Thank you for inviting us today.`
` ...May I sit here?"`
`"Yes, go right ahead!"`
`"With all of us here, this is sure to be the best part.`
` Please, go easy on me."`
`"Then should we get started?`
` Is this everyone?"`
`"...Everyone but Keiichi."`
`"Which means... Maebara-san is as busy as ever recording the script. Has he already started recording the script for the next story...?"`
`"How unfortunate.`
` It doesn't feel right to leave him out."`
`"Miyo-san, you don't have to worry about that.`
` At times like these, going all-out is actually a way of showing consideration."`
`"That's true, isn't it~?!`
` We're all here for once. Holding a wake would be boring~!!"`
`"Tahahaha...`
` Then... sorry, Keiichi-kun... but we'll take things from here!"`
`"It's decided!!`
` Okay, everyone, get the cups!`
` Does anyone not like carbonated drinks~?"`
`"There's alcohol for the adults, too. Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`"Rika-chan, what will you have?`
` Grape juice?`
` Orange juice?"`
`"......Meep.`
` I want what Tomitake's having."`
`"Hey!`
` Rika-chan, you're not allowed to drink!"`
`"Has everyone got their cups~?`
` If we don't make a toast soon, my juice will get warm~!"`
`"Who will lead, Mion?"`
`"Rena should do it.`
` Okay, Rena, go ahead!"`
`"Then... ahem!`
` Everyone, excellent work—the Watanagashi chapter is now over~!!"`
`"""Thank you~~~!!!!"""`
`Wahhh~~~~!!! Clap clap clap clap!!!!`
`"Okay, everybody's here!`
` Shall we debate the story again?"`
`"I think so.`
` Then, let's get some honest opinions.`
` Does anyone here have something to say~?!"`
`"An honest opinion... was the story this time not an answer chapter?`
` The criminal was Mion-san!`
` The root of aaaaall the evil was the Sonozaki family!`
` Was that not the conclusion?"`
`"Hmm... I see.`
` I was so sure... that Mii-chan wasn't the criminal..."`
`"Too naive!`
` This was entirely predictable from the previous Onikakushi chapter, was it not?`
` In fact, it's almost shocking how predictable it was."`
`"You're right.`
` It probably did align with most of the predictions made by players of the previous scenario."`
`"......It's like the story went exactly as everyone expected."`
`"Then... does that mean... the main Higurashi When They Cry scenario is pretty much over...?`
` So it's a sure thing... that the root of everything was Mii-chan's family...?"`
`"I wonder?`
` In fact... I think that this all means the theory of the Sonozakis being the guilty party has been disproven."`
`"Oh, you had the same opinion, Miyo-san.`
` I think the same way.`
` ...Though I still don't believe in curses. `
`At the very least, however, I think the chances of the Sonozaki family being the true criminals has gone down."`
`"Huh?`
` Why is that?`
` ...Didn't Mii-chan confess that she killed everyone...?"`
`"That's right.`
` She killed Rika and me, so what do you mean that she isn't the criminal after all that??"`
`"I'm not trying to confuse you or anything.`
` It's just that I think there are a lot of things that don't go along with Mion being the one behind everything.`
` If you think about it a little, you'll get it."`
`"Huh.`
` I had believed the truth to be more or less in line with the Sonozaki family theory...`
` but I'd love to hear your theory, Mion-chan!"`
`"Then hear me out.`
`...Near the end, I confessed that I'd participated in the past incidents, right?`
` I thought something wasn't really right about that, so I guess that's my basis.`
` I mean, think about it. `
`If the incidents of the past were caused by the Sonozaki family, that would be crazy!`
` I mean, wouldn't they all be perfect crimes?`
` They were all attributed to other criminals or simple accidents, after all."`
`"Well, that's right.`
` The Sonozaki family is very powerful, and they were acting behind the scenes.`
` Wouldn't pulling off perfect crimes be child's play for them?"`
`"That's just it. That's the weird thing!`
` The Sonozaki family had been killing and erasing people so well for the last four years they didn't even let out a hint that they were behind it, right?`
`But the incident in the fifth year, now that was really cheap.`
` They were killing and erasing people at random.`
` Any idiot could have seen the connection with the Sonozaki family."`
`"Now that I think about it, you're right.`
` The incidents in the past were all mysterious, and nobody could tell if they were because of the curse or just simple crimes. `
`But then, on the fifth year, they suddenly got really violent."`
`"I do not understand what you are saying.`
` ...Rika, do you?"`
`"......She means that if the Sonozaki family were the real criminals, then they would have done a much, much better job with the incident on the fifth year."`
`"So... what does that mean?`
` Mion-san wasn't the one who killed Rika and me, but it was the work of the demon who possessed Mion-san?"`
`"Come, now!!`
` Just like I thought last time, Mion-san wasn't a bad person after all, was she~?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Satoko-chan and I both thought that she was doing bad things because she was possessed by something.`
` Then... does that mean our theory was right?!"`
`"I've been supporting the curse theory since the last after party, and the story this time makes me all the more convinced it's true.`
` ...That fact revealed at the very end, `
`the information regarding how Mion-san and Takano-san had died days before, despite being witnessed, seems to indeed support that theory."`
`"Oh, my...`
` I see the curse believers, who seemed unconfident last time, have grown quite a bit more self-assured.`
` Do any of those who think it was a human have any objections?"`
`"Last time, Mii-chan and Rika-chan were the ones who thought it was the work of a person.`
` Tomitake-san did too, didn't he?`
` Okay, let's hear what you've got then!"`
`"Hmm... You've got me there.`
` I can't quite find the right words..."`
`"One of the pieces of evidence for the curse theory is the mismatching times of death, right?`
` So if I could disprove that theory, it would prove that a human did it, wouldn't it?"`
`"Oh! Shion, do you have a good objection?"`
`"Well, I suppose.`
` I have the same opinion as you, Mion, that it was a human... but I don't think the Sonozaki family were the main culprits either.`
` If it's okay with you, I'll offer my objections."`
`"Woh-ho-ho-ho!`
` Show us what you've got!`
` If you say it wasn't the curse, then let's hear your evidence~!!"`
`"Okay, Shion-chan.`
` That last trick we've been talking about.`
` Despite Mion-chan having died the day of the incident from falling into the well, how did she appear days later to kill you and Keiichi-kun?"`
`"Here it is: my Sonozaki sisters conspiracy theory.`
` My reason is simple.`
` If Mion was dead by that time, then the only one who could have stabbed Kei-chan was me. I disguised myself as Mion and stabbed him! `
`Then I went back to my room, pretended to have a tussle with a ghost, then jumped right down and killed myself."`
`"So when you get down to it, Mion-chan, in this case, would be the one to take the blame.`
` She would take care of the mayor in person, and Shion-chan would be made into merely a victim. `
`If she hid herself in the well, the disguised Shion-chan could show up where she pleased and murder whoever she wanted—all planned from the start."`
`"I get it.`
` ...Then Mion-san made two mistakes.`
`First was that her corpse was found, and second was dying when she only planned to hide.`
` That's what it would mean."`
`"...Oh, well now...`
` ...You're right... There is something logical about that..."`
`"However... I'm still not convinced!`
` It was too different from the magnificent, perfect crimes in the past.`
` ...Even if their plan went well, Mion would end up the bad guy, wouldn't she? `
`She would either have to hide the rest of her life, or live pretending to be Shion, wouldn't she?`
` That would be too constrained!`
` You can't call that a perfect crime!"`
`"......In other words, whether by dying or disappearing, Mii would have to go away."`
`"Rika-chama, that's a good thought.`
` That means we should consider that Mion Sonozaki leaving the stage was part of their plan.`
` That's why, at the end, Mion took the blame for all the incidents in the past. `
`She took responsibility for all of them herself, then left!"`
`"By doing that, she could cover up the true culprit behind the past incidents.`
` ...Which means that this incident wasn't shabby... its purpose was to cement all the past incidents as perfect crimes. `
`...I suppose that's what it comes down to...?"`
`"The young leader of the Sonozaki family, who was the biggest suspect, confessed to everything and disappeared. `
`......For her, or perhaps for the non-Sonozaki true culprit, there likely was no more favorable outcome."`
`"............I don't understand even an inch of your conversation.`
` What do you mean by Mion-san taking the blame?`
` Is she not the culprit...??"`
`"Let me put it this way.`
` The true culprit behind the serial freak death incidents was somebody else. `
`Mii-chan gave a fake confession that she caused all the previous incidents to protect that person... or so everyone's saying."`
`"My, my... I said this during the story... but it seems we have an incredible detective on our hands!`
` Yes... it does seem a bit persuasive!"`
`"An incident started to throw the scent off the true criminal.`
` That's my reasoning.`
` Though if I go further, I think the true culprit isn't part of the Sonozaki family."`
`"So it was Mion-chan disrupting the incident to further protect the mystery person who pulled off perfect crimes four years running, then?"`
`"That's right.`
` The director who only appeared by name in the last story is pretty suspicious, if you ask me!"`
`"......Amazing.`
` It really does all add up."`
` Clap clap clap.`
`"I still think the Sonozaki family and the sisters are the culprits, though.`
` An incident caused by the sisters to sever their old fetters to the Three Families—to clear away the past...`
` That's my theory."`
`"Clearing away the past...`
` You mean that they placed the blame for the Three Families' crimes on their final leader, Mion, to put an end to a dark history—and then the two of them left."`
`"That's right.`
` It would make it a sad story, where we sisters finally choose to end it after a lot of worry.`
` Aha, we went a little too far!"`
`"......Amazing.`
` It really does all add up."`
` Clap clap clap.`
`"Wait, what?`
` It looks like Rika-chan has an opinion too.`
` Go ahead, Rika-chan!"`
`"......I have a question for you all.`
` ...Why did Keiichi need to get stabbed?"`
`"...We already know why that is, Rika.`
` It's obviously because he went in the forbidden storehouse without asking."`
`"Thinking back on it now, Tomitake-kun and Takano-san probably died in the previous story because they snuck into that storehouse, eh?`
` ............Hmm?"`
`"......*giggle*`
` That is rather strange indeed."`
`"Huh?`
` What is it that's strange...?"`
`"...Ah!!`
` Rena-san, that's right!`
` Won't you think back, please?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` ...In the previous scenario, they were after Keiichi's life even though he didn't sneak into the ritual storehouse."`
`...Murmur murmur murmur!`
`"Well, that's because...`
` Yeah!`
` Hinamizawa hates outsiders, right?`
` That's why they tried to kill Keiichi-kun...!"`
`"That would be strange, though.`
` ...They should have attacked Kei-chan's parents too, in that case.`
` No matter how you look at it, though, his parents never seemed to be in much danger. `
`Either this time or the last."`
`"Hear that, everyone who thinks it was a human's doing~?!`
` Unless you can properly explain the reason Keiichi-san's life was threatened, you can't definitely prove the criminal was human, can you~?!?!"`
`"Nah-ha-ha-ha.`
` Even with the curse theory, however, we don't know why Maebara-san was attacked this time or last time."`
`"With a little more, we would have had it...`
` There are still a lot of mysteries remaining..."`
`"*giggle*......`
` We can find some kind of reason for everyone but Keiichi-kun to die... but for some reason, Keiichi-kun's death is always vague.`
` ...Both this time and last time. `
`He was being targeted regardless of whether he went into the ritual storehouse."`
`"...Then does that not mean he was doing something that got him killed both last time and this time...?"`
`"...I see...`
` If we can find something in common about Maebara-kun's actions between last time and this time... it seems like it would be the key to unraveling all the incidents..."`
`"I skimmed through the stories again... but I think he's going about his life in his own way.`
` ...Though aside from the part with the storehouse, I didn't spot anything suspicious about his daily lifestyle!"`
`"Hmm...`
` ...Keiichi-kun... What did you do both last time and this time...?`
` Something bad that would cause you to be killed!"`
`"...It's best to ask the person himself when you're unsure."`
`"......Hohoh.`
` ...So while I was reading the script for the next game all by myself, you were all talking about me behind my back, huh?`
` I see..."`
`"Well, that's that.`
` Anyway, Keiichi-kun, you should try asking your own heart..."`
`"Kei-chan, so what kind of bad thing did you do that would get you killed?"`
`"It must surely be all the violent things he does towards me~!!"`
`"The way he sometimes directs a dangerous gaze my way and makes strange deluded expressions is surely a criminal act."`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` Being happy all day, surrounded by girls around his age, is kind of like a crime in the first place."`
`"Nah-ha-ha-ha-ha!!`
` A grave crime indeed!`
` Maebara-san is truly an envious main character, isn't he?`
` Switch out with me once in a while, would you?"`
`"Ku-ku-ku...!`
` Well, with all those perks, getting stabbed at the end really isn't much of a price to pay."`
`"Well, there you go, Keiichi-san.`
` Have you remembered the crimes you've committed?"`
`"Mgaaahhhhhh!!!!`
` Both this time and last time...`
` I live a proper and just life, and I always meet a terrible fate in the end!!`
` What was that about 'ask my own heart'?! `
`I'm the one who wants to know! This is bullying!!!!"`
`".........How sad, how sad.`
` I'll pet your head next time for you."`
`"I wonder if we should go back and read Onikakushi again after reading this one...?"`
`"I'm going to put myself in Mion's shoes and read back over Watanagashi.`
` Maybe I'll find something different compared to when I read it from Kei-chan's point of view."`
`"I will always think it was the doing of a demon!!`
` All of the events and tricks can be explained with a demon!!!"`
`"......It's kind of like plasma."`
`"What did you, the readers, think about it?`
` We'd certainly like to hear your thoughts and opinions!"`
`"There's still a way to go, but do your best~!"`
`"With that, please look forward to the rest of the Higurashi series."`
