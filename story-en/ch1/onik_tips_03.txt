`"...So Kei-chan, you're not stinking rich?"`
`"What is this all of a sudden?`
` Did I come to school in a limo before?"`
`"How much do you get for a monthly allowance?"`
`"About 1000 yen..."`
`"My, that's a rather plebeian amount."`
`"...His lunch is made up of normal stuff.`
` He isn't rich."`
`What are they talking about!?`
`To be asked out of nowhere how much I get and then told that's a plebeian amount!`
`"Ahahahaha. Sorry, sorry!"`
`Rena seemed to pick up on my dubious expression and started giggling.`
`"Kei-chan... your house, you know... It's pretty big, yeah?`
` So the architecture has people all around Hinamizawa calling it the Maebara Manor, and it sorta stands out."`
`M-Maebara Manor~!?`
`"Since the house is so big, everybody is gossiping, wondering exactly how rich you are."`
`I see.`
` Now I get it.`
`...Well, the frame of it is huge.`
` I see how it could cause some misunderstandings.`
`"From my deduction, I wager they spent too much money on building the house, and that is why they are now broke~!"`
`"...Being broke, how very, very unfortunate."`
`...Rika-chan took pity on me as she patted my head.`
` I go from being treated like a millionaire to a beggar...`
`"Yeah, sorry for ruining your imagination, but we aren't millionaires or poor.`
` We're the image of a normal, average household."`
`"You can't call it normal with that huge house!`
` The entranceway is all grand, and the gate is large enough for a large truck to get through!!`
` That's not normal at all!"`
`They do say the bigger your house, the more prosperous you are.`
`The reason the house is so big is because Dad's studio is in it, too.`
`There are a bunch of different workshops, and lots of his works are hung up in different places.`
` All of them are huge, too.`
`For those reasons, the family actually uses only a third of the house for day-to-day living.`
`He planned it out so people and cars could come in to see the gallery he opens up in the house someday.`
`...By the way, the entranceway Mion is talking about is the one for the studio, and is normally sealed off.`
` The entranceway the Maebara family actually uses is a very plain and simple one.`
`The interior is much different from how it looks on the outside.`
`"I'd really like a chance to explore Kei-chan's house...`
` Claiming not to be rich, but having a home like that!!`
` What could be hidden there!?"`
`"M-Maybe there's something kyute hidden! Hau~!"`
`"They probably had no money to purchase furniture, so it's filled with spartan rooms!"`
`"...If there are carpeted rooms, I would love to try rolling around on the floor."`
`"Waa~! That'd be great, so great! I want to roll around, too~!"`
`...Seems like their imaginations were just piling on...`
`Well... Sometime in the near future, it wouldn't be too bad to invite them all to my house.`
`...Dad is a sucker for the ladies, so he might even let them look around his studio.`
`The cry of the higurashi crescendoed, as the sky towered over everything.`
`It was hot but the air was clear. It smelled like the beginning of summer.`
