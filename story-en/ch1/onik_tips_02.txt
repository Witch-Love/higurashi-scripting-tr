`It's only June...`
` but it's already so hot.`
`I could hear the higurashi outside chirping "miii miii," and at night, there are mosquitos.`
` ...It might as well be summer already.`
`...My only salvation was that the mornings were still cool.`
`"Summer, I do declare!"`
`Satoko was flapping her skirt languidly.`
`...That's pretty unladylike there.`
`...Even if she was a little brat, she still was a girl.`
`"Keiichi does seem quite cool with just a single button-up shirt...`
` I'm so jealous."`
`"From how I see things, the skirt you're wearing looks like it would be much cooler.`
` A girl like you wouldn't understand just how hot it is wearing jeans in this season!"`
`"...It... it gets hot... Hau..."`
`This girl has gone imagining something indecent...`
`"Rena's summer clothes have a nice refreshing color.`
` I feel cooler just looking at them."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Thank you!`
` They really do feel pretty cool."`
`"I do wish my summer clothes were as breezy as Rena's."`
`"But Satoko-chan, your summer clothes are so cute, being a one piece and all!`
` I'd like to wear your summer clothes.â˜†"`
`"This is actually quite stuffy, you know.`
` I do believe what you're wearing would feel much cooler."`
`"But it would be so much more fun with kyute clothes... Hau!"`
`...I had a feeling that Rena and Satoko's base values were fundamentally different.`
`"Speaking of which... our school doesn't have a uniform."`
`"Yeah.`
` It doesn't.`
` As long as they're proper, then regular clothes are fine."`
`There are quite a few students in regular clothes.`
` There were a few wearing uniforms, but they were all the same design and rather plain.`
`"...What's the uniform they're all wearing?`
` They're all the same."`
`"That's the city school's uniform.`
` It's not like there's a rule, but they're all wearing them."`
`"Speaking of which, everybody in our group is wearing a different uniform, aren't we?`
` Did you go out of your way to get them from somewhere?"`
`"Why, yes. Mion-san supplied them."`
`"Mii-chan's relative runs a secondhand clothing store. They can get school clothes from all over the country for cheap, they say."`
`"So you asked those relatives to get a bunch of unique school uniforms, then."`
`...That Mion, she probably loves using her friends as dress-up dolls.`
`...That must be a strange secondhand clothing store.`
`I get that it's a secondhand clothing store, but stocking clothes from schools all over the country?`
`...That's pretty strange for a secondhand clothing store.`
`What's the point in stocking up clothes from faraway schools they know nothing about??`
`"...Yeah. I think so, too.`
` They also have used school swimsuits and P.E. uniforms...`
` I don't like the idea of having used ones."`
`"Doesn't sound like that shop makes much money...`
` They probably have Mion pitch in and help so they can make a bit more."`
`"...But Mion-san says 'It'll be a big hit and become a great store!'`
` with such conviction."`
`...A secondhand clothing store that stocks school uniforms will be a big hit?`
`... I don't get it.`
