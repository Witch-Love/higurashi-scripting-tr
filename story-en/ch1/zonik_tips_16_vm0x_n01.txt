`"Well, from the popular consensus in psychology,`
` it's believed that people are most likely to attempt suicide when swinging from an introverted state to an extroverted one."`
`"Individuals in the introverted state suffer from low self-esteem and are quite pessimistic,`
` but rarely commit suicide.`
` They don't have the willpower to commit suicide. `
`The opposite state doesn't lead to suicide, either.`
` That has an opposite effect, filling the person with confidence and making them feel as though they're walking on air.`
` Thus, they do not commit suicide."`
`"...I see.`
` Neither state causes suicide, but when the condition changes, they might do so?"`
`"There is a desire to commit suicide when in an introverted state, but they do not have the willpower to commit such a formidable act.`
` But when they enter an extroverted state, they gain a burst of willpower and they can act freely again."`
`"I see!`
` So it means they gain the willpower to commit suicide."`
`"That's how it goes.`
` That's why patients are prescribed medication during that time to keep them from acting on their impulses."`
`"...Then was Tomitake in this mental state?"`
`"Such people generally commit suicide by more 'civilized' means.`
` They prepare.`
` It's completely different from self-harm!"`
`"Tomitake's death wasn't civilized...`
`So one would think it was caused by some foreign substance.`
` As I said from the start: tell me of a drug that causes someone to commit suicide."`
`"There are reports that some analgesics can cause a violent psychological transition from introverted to extroverted.`
`...Overdoses of drugs with a hypnotic effect are also reported to cause erratic behavior, but it's not common."`
`"Neither showed up in the autopsy report.`
` Are there any other possibilities?"`
`"All I can think of is that it's some sort of illness.`
`Often, diseases affecting the thyroid are reported to cause similar symptoms.`
` But they all have many characteristic symptoms of their own.`
` The deceased exhibited none of them."`
`"I wonder, is there something that could happen more spontaneously?`
` Something that fits this case and would cause someone to want to commit suicide all of a sudden."`
`"Let's see... as another possibility...`
` There's a condition where brain injury causes psychological problems.`
` Drugs can be to blame, but it can also be caused by physical trauma, and some diseases."`
`"Bwah ha ha!`
` Basically, he knocked his noggin in the brawl and that made him go haywire."`
