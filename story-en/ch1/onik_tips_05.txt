`October, 1975.`
`In accordance with the Prime Minister's bulletin number XXX, Hinamizawa's electrical development master plan was announced.`
`The vast scope of the projected Hinamizawa dam was to have an incredibly heavy impact on the village of Hinamizawa.`
`The area to be flooded by the Hinamizawa dam would include the five areas of Hinamizawa, Takatsudo, Kiyotsu, Matsumoto, and Yagochi.`
`The submerged area would include 291 houses.`
` Population: 1,251,`
` 1 elementary school,`
` 1 middle school,`
` 1 post office,`
` 1 agricultural cooperative,`
` 1 forestry department lumber yard,`
` 5 shrines,`
` 2 temples, `
`and 1 fishery.`
` All of these communal, cultural, agricultural areas, and places of worship were to be indefinitely submerged at the bottom of the artificial lake basin.`
`Forsaking the hundreds of years our ancestors poured their blood and sweat into this fertile, resource-rich land was just too painful to bear.`
`All the residents having homes that were to be submerged banded together, and created the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
`The dam project was halted and petitions to alter the plan were circulated.`
`The citizens sought peaceful negotiations, but the government and its puppet company XXXXX openly refused.`
`Performing unspeakable, heinous acts, they quashed the democratic actions of the villagers.`
`But the villagers did not falter. Instead, they banded together even more closely and steeled their resolve to protect their homes to the death.`
`The continuation of that frightening Hinamizawa dam construction project is still stalled as of today.`
`The villagers understand that the stalling was caused by sublime power through unity`
` and they understand that this fearsome plan has not yet been fully withdrawn.`
`The Onigafuchi Guardians had been dissolved after it did its part, but the feelings of unity it garnered have not yet been extinguished.`
`As long as that passion resides in the hearts of the residents, they'll be able to confront whomever next decides to sink their homes into a lake basin.`
`Onigafuchi Guardians Committee Chairman,`
` Kiichirou Kimiyoshi`
