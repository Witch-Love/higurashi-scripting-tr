`"What's this, Keiichi?`
` So many!`
` There's no reason to get all the different kinds, is there!?"`
`I flopped all the different colored cup noodle bowls into the cart.`
`"Keiichi.`
` Buy them in the big case. It's cheaper."`
`Dad faltered.`
`"If you can't pick, then Mommy will pick for you."`
`You don't have to rush me...!`
`I quickly search the cases of noodles for what I want.`
`"Pork-bone & Ginger, large cup?`
` Hey, Keiichi, can't you get a more normal one?"`
