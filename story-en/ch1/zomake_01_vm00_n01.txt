`"As I understand it, this ~Onikakushi~ chapter is supposed to be somewhat of a prologue to the entire series."`
`The player digging through the story in order to avoid a bad ending is the point of these types of games after all."`
`"...It's still just the first chapter. I'm looking forward to the next one."`
`"What happens in the next chapter?`
` Rena, do you know?"`
`"Yeah. They said the next chapter will introduce another aspect of the story."`
`"...That's a strange way of putting it.`
` What does that mean?"`
`"In this chapter, they introduced the string of mysterious deaths that were happening in Hinamizawa recently, right?`
` The next chapter will introduce some of the history of Hinamizawa."`
`"...It's probably because he doesn't have any character art so he couldn't poke his head in even if he wanted to."`
`"Rika-san, that's what we refer to as a 'personal problem,'`
` hehehehe!"`
`"I see.`
` A member of some repressed family looking to air out an old grudge of their ancestors... something like that?`
` Hmmm... I don't like that."`
`"...You can come if you get some character art for yourself."`
`"Rika, that's a secret..."`
` Everybody's just picking on me!!!!"`
