`Nightmare befalls the Hinamizawa dam!`
`Lynching and murder/dismemberment!`
`On X day of X month in XX prefecture at the Hinamizawa dam construction work site in Shishibone City, a bone-chillingly gruesome murder/dismemberment.`
`Even though this case has shocked the archipelago, the police will give no details on the case...`
` Exactly what happened at the Hinamizawa dam...?`
`"They probably didn't mean to kill him at first,`
` but as the victim resisted by swinging around a shovel, the rest of the perpetrators armed themselves in return, and it quickly escalated to homicide."`
`So said the aforementioned Investigator A.`
`After this bloody tragedy was over, they were left with a body which nobody could have mistaken as alive...`
`XX-san had tormented the suspects daily with his rough behavior.`
`At first it was meant to be payback...`
`"All the perpetrators were horrified by their deed`
` and one even turned himself in to the police."`
`It was the de facto leader of this group, XX, who suggested hiding the body.`
`Reluctantly at first, they soon began to think they did not wish to be caught.`
`The construction site had numerous places to hide the body with six people...`
`They were originally supposed to hide the body and leave the area...`
`But the de facto leader feared that the consciences of the other five wouldn't be able to bear the burden`
` and came up with a horrifying method to keep them from turning him in to the police...`
`He devised the heinous method of splitting up the body among them and making each of them responsible for hiding a piece.`
`"XX had turned a simple manslaughter into a gruesome dismemberment and forcibly involved each perpetrator in order to create a sense of unity between them."`
`Each one participated.`
` But what does this mean?`
` Person A spoke out reluctantly:`
`"XX had ordered each and every one of them to dissect a piece for themselves.`
` They were hesitant at first, but nobody refused."`
`In for a penny, in for a pound... was what it meant.`
`Thus, an unimaginable bloody ceremony began.`
`"The perpetrators wept and vomited as they performed the gruesome task. `
`There was one person who stubbornly refused, but XX threatened them, saying, "Nothing would change if someone else ended up dead," and he gave up in his objections.`
`But XX's plan collapsed in the span of one night.`
`XXX, who had refused to dissect the corpse up until the last moment, had broken down into tears at the hospital where he was being treated for an injury sustained during the scuffle and confessed...`
`The criminals were arrested one after the other, but the de facto leader XX's whereabouts are still unknown.`
`Also, the right arm hidden by XX has yet to be found.`
`Despite an ongoing search, this horrible individual has so far managed to elude law enforcement.`
`What could the police be doing...?`
`"It appears that XX had said he was going to throw the body (right arm) into the swamp.`
` XX's car was discovered abandoned near the swamp, but there were no clues to his whereabouts."`
`XX didn't trust his companions.`
`One cannot deny the possibility that he had expected his companions to confess to the police and used his car as a decoy.`
`"Of course, I doubt that theory.`
` Since he has no car, one would expect him to have a limited area to which he could have escaped to. `
`But within the station there were rumors going around that he had accidentally slipped and drowned in the swamp when he went to throw away the body."`
`To the locals, that swamp is believed to be bottomless.`
` It's known as Onigafuchi, the Demon's Abyss, and it's said that the bottom of the swamp is connected to the hellish world of demons.`
`The atrocious demon from hell that was XX.`
` Could it be that he had returned to hell through the swamp...?`
