`"A Colonel Sanders!?`
` Ah~ Of course that's right up her alley!"`
`"...I understand her wanting to take home Satoko and Rika-chan.`
` But I can't understand the Colonel Sanders! What's so good about that four-eyed geezer!?"`
`"Probably better to hear it from Rena, don't you think?`
` She'll probably just say, 'because it's just so kyute☆' though."`
`"Does Rena often... go to the construction site to hunt for treasure?"`
`"...Every now and then she says she's going to have a look."`
`"But... a girl her age rummaging around in garbage is, well..."`
`"...If Rena enjoys it, then I think it's fine."`
`"What were they doing over there?`
` Dam construction?"`
`It had been bugging me since yesterday, like an itch I couldn't scratch.`
`"Hahaha! It was cancelled a long time ago."`
`"...Everyone gathered together and fought against it."`
`Hearing an ominous word like "fought" come from Rika-chan's mouth startled me.`
`"That's right!`
` It was unbelievable!`
` They said Hinamizawa would be sunk into the reservoir and we had no say in the matter!"`
`So, I'm only able to be here because the protest succeeded.`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!`
` I didn't keep you, did I? ...Did I?"`
`"My deepest apologies, Keiichi-san. It took me a while to powder my nose!"`
`"Satoko.`
` Wait to use the can until you really have to go.`
` It's a lot easier since it shoots right out."`
`"Eek...`
`...`
` Eek... How dare you speak that way to a maiden of unparalleled beauty such as myself!?!?!"`
`Who was she calling a maiden?`
` If Satoko really was a maiden, she wouldn't have reacted like that.`
`The usual hijinx ensued.`
`"Now, then.`
` Gentlemen. In accordance with the rules of our society, I bring a point to discussion!`
` He, Keiichi Maebara-kun, wishes to be included as a member in our activities... What say you!?"`
`"Rena has no objection!"`
`"Ohohoho!`
` I wonder if the likes of this peasant is up to the task."`
`"...Me and Satoko both approve."`
`The three that Mion had queried voiced their approval.`
`"A unanimous decision! Congratulations, Keiichi Maebara-kun.`
` I present you the honor of being allowed to take the entrance exam for our club!"`
`"Start from the beginning!`
` I didn't say I would join!`
` What club is this?"`
`"What our club does, you see... In order to cope with our complicated society, we perform various activities under different sets of rules.`
` ...Sometimes they are in your favor. `
`And sometimes they work against you...!!"`
`"...I'm pretty weak... so I'd prefer if you didn't single me out. Let's try to get along."`
`"You're so naive, Rena!`
` The Law of the Jungle is survival of the fittest!"`
`...This was starting to sound a bit sketchy...`
` So what kind of club was it!?`
`"...To sum it up, it's a club where we play games together."`
`Rika-chan was the only one to answer my question with a pertinent response.`
`So basically this "club" put Mion's hobby of collecting games to use.`
`By playing the various games that Mion had hoarded every day.`
`It seemed that, depending on the day, there were prizes for the winner or a penalty for the person who finished in last place.`
`"I'll make this clear right now. We aren't playing house here!`
` You should treat each win or loss as if your life depends on it, all right!?"`
`"W-What's wrong with just having fun...!?`
` Don't make it sound so crazy."`
`"The first rule of our society!!`
` Aim only for first place!`
` ...Going at it half-assed just because 'it's a game' is not allowed!"`
`"Rule number two of our society!`
` For that reason, you are obligated to make all possible efforts!"`
`...The way Satoko said it, it sounded like she was saying, "use any means necessary."`
`"...Of course, I will do my best, too."`
`"I'm pretty weak... but I'm trying my best."`
`I knew what they were trying to say.`
`In a game where everybody is aiming for the top, it's rather unsportsmanlike to play just for fun.`
`"All right. Then I, too... will go all-out!!"`
`With that, I was finally ready for the rite of initiation... My baptism into the club.`
`"A word of warning, Kei-chan.`
` ...Rena can get pretty nasty."`
`This initiation looks like it's going to be rough...`
`Mion began fishing around in the student lockers in the back of the room.`
`...They have the games here at the school?`
` ...Well, it's club equipment, so I guess that's fine.`
`"Complicated games would put Kei-chan at a disadvantage.`
` So today, we'll play a game that you should be familiar with.`
` How about a standard card game...?`
` ...`
`Like Old Bachelor!?"`
`"All right! Let's do this!!"`
`"Can't really get into it unless there's a penalty!`
` This time the loser will be sentenced to having their face drawn on!`
` What do you think!?"`
`"Whoa,`
` whoa`
` ...It won't be a permanent marker, right?`
` ...Right...?"`
`...Permanent... She wants to draw on our faces with permanent marker?`
`"That is perfect—!!!!"`
`Satoko cheered the idea on.`
`She didn't even flinch at the thought of such a severe penalty.`
` It seemed like she was raring to go.`
`...If it's going to be like this, then I can't lose either!`
`"Then I'll just cut the deck... and start dealing!"`
`Old Bachelor is pretty much the same as Old Maid.`
`There's only one difference: there's no joker.`
` In its place, one card is pulled out at the start.`
`Meaning there will be one card without a match left over at the end.`
`You don't know which card will end up being the joker.`
` It's a pretty thrilling game!`
`"I'll take out the card now."`
`Mion took out one card and left it face down on the table.`
`Everybody stared at the card intently.`
`"Well, it'll be pretty obvious in the endgame.`
` No way to tell at the start."`
`But... the rest of them were very serious.`
` They didn't seem as relaxed as I was.`
`They compared their cards to the one face down, all the while gauging each other's reactions.`
`It was as if...they could see what the face down card was...`
`...No, it couldn't be.`
`"...This deck is pretty worn out.`
` ...No way... Can everyone tell by the scratches what the card on the table is...?"`
`"Remember the second rule of our society~`
` Keiichi-san must try his hardest to win as well~!"`
`"A number of cards are quite unique... Keiichi-kun should be able to remember them pretty quickly."`
`She said that so matter-of-factly.`
`"S-Suits me fine!!`
` Don't think a little thing like that can be your crutch!!!"`
`...I lashed out angrily, but it was rather obvious I was at a disadvantage.`
`After all... they'd gone so far as to memorize the wear and tear for each individual card...!`
`This wasn't a simple game of Old Bachelor.`
` ...If this was a test...`
` then they were playing with the answer sheet in front of them!!`
`Bring it!`
` I'll take advantage of your carelessness and beat you at your own game...!`
`...That baseless confidence... would soon be crushed...`
`"Kekeke!`
` How about I tell you your hand starting from the right?`
` Three,`
` Four,`
` Nine,`
` Jack,`
` Queen."`
`"WaAargh!!"`
`"...By the way, the bachelor is the Jack of Diamonds."`
`"GaAaRgh!!"`
`"I can tell what they are even if you switch them around!`
` I am out!!"`
`"UuUrrgh!!"`
`I thought I was prepared... but for it to be this brutal... Just overwhelming...!!!`
`"D... Demons...`
` You're all demons...!`
` Rena... isn't... a demon, are you...?"`
`"S-Sorry, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...This is the Three of Hearts, isn't it?`
` ...I'm out!"`
`"UwaAaaAaaAaaaAAah!!"`
`Not even a hint of mercy...!!`
` Rena... Even Rika-chan...!!`
`These club activities weren't to be trifled with.`
` An alumnus of this club would definitely survive in the cruelest of situations...`
`If our entire class had self-detonating collars strapped to their necks and were dropped into a death match on a deserted island, these guys would probably take to it like fish to water.`
`I can already picture their joy as they hunt down each of their classmates...`
`"It's a lowest point system.`
` The order itself dictates the points. Whoever has the lowest point total wins!"`
`"...Since Keiichi finished last, he has five points."`
`There's already a 5 marked down on my scoreboard...!`
`"...I-I think it's unfair to Keiichi-kun if we don't use a new deck."`
`"It's fine, it's fine. Kei-chan is a man after all.`
`He can turn the tables even if the odds are stacked against him, right!?"`
`"It's fitting for a lowly peasant to scamper home and soak their pillow in tears, don't you think~??"`
`A petite hand laid itself on top of my head, which was trembling from uncontainable frustration.`
` ...It was Rika-chan's.`
`"...Keep on fighting,`
` yeah~."`
`Thanks to Rika-chan's words of encouragement, I was able to calm down.`
`You need to be calm, especially when you're cornered.`
` ...That's the "power" I could muster during this crisis.`
`Think clearly, Keiichi Maebara.`
`...Take your time and look at the cards carefully.`
`It's just as Rena said, several of the cards have their own distinct markings making them stand out. Memorizing them should be pretty simple.`
`Think about what you can do in this situation. Try everything in your power to improve your chances of victory.`
`"Whoa... Great, Keiichi-kun. Just like that!"`
`I covered the uniquely-marked cards with my hands or other cards, arranging them in such a way that they couldn't be seen.`
`"...The one with the ripped corner should be the Five...`
` And... I'm out."`
`I couldn't let any of those precious hints slip by me.`
` All information is a weapon.`
`Then it was my turn.`
`Satoko fanned out her cards for me.`
`"You see, I want the Seven.`
` ...Is it this one?"`
`"...I wonder about that...`
` You won't know unless you take it..."`
`There was a bit of dismay in her expression.`
` ...Like she doesn't want it taken... That kind of expression...!`
`I won't let that momentary lapse slip by me!!`
`"I know!!`
` It's this ooooone!!!!"`
`Got it!`
` Seven of Spades...!!!`
`A cheer of "Ooo!" rang out!`
`"W-Wh-Wh-What is this!?`
` The Seven should be the hardest one of all to tell apart~!?!?!"`
`It wasn't from memorizing the markings. Those slight changes in their expressions as I was selecting a card were enough!`
`"Can't hide it from me, Kei-chan!`
` ...This mark means it's the Two of Diamonds.`
` ...What!?"`
`She was startled by her own misread.`
` Of course everyone else was too...!`
`"...Whoa`
` ...It's rare that Mii-chan gets a card wrong."`
`"N-No...`
` Kei-chan`
` ...`
` Could it be... you...!!"`
`They told them apart by different "marks."`
` That mark was a "nail scratch."`
`So... I put...`
` a new one on it!!`
`"Are you saying he disguised it... as the Two of Diamonds!?`
` W...What an impressive show of wit...!!"`
`"...Keiichi landed a clean hit."`
`Clap clap clap...`
`"That's great, Keiichi-kun!`
` That was an incredible match, you know!? You know!?"`
`Having defeated the forerunner, Mion, my brilliant battle left me ecstatic.`
`But by total points, it was already set in stone that Mion would win and I would finish last.`
`I laughed haughtily, selecting the tone of my voice carefully to get on Mion's nerves.`
`"...Well... I'm going to end up the loser, but I'm satisfied with one-upping Mion at the end.☆`
` Bwahahahahahaa~...♪"`
`That should be the proverbial slap in the face to Mion, who was at the top already and ensured victory...!`
`"Even if Kei-chan gets first place this round, he'll still end up last place overall`
` ...`
`Don't you hate that?"`
`"Of course I do!"`
`"Let's have a duel.`
` One chance!`
` If you win, then we'll swap first and last place! ...How about it!? You up for it!?"`
`She fell for it!`
`A chance for an upset that wouldn't be possible without goading her into it!!`
`"One chance, you say?`
` Let me hear the rules."`
`Mion discarded two cards from her hand and replaced one with the joker card that was on the table, then shuffled the resulting hand behind her back.`
`"The card in my right or the card in my left!`
` If Kei-chan can guess which hand the joker's in, then he wins!"`
`"When you turned around just now, you didn't pull out the joker, did you!?"`
`"If you lose, I'll show the card in the other hand.`
` That okay?"`
`The other three gulped nervously at this unexpected turn of events.`
`"...All right!!`
` You've got it!!!!"`
`Mion grasped one card in each hand and thrust them out at me!`
`First, I needed to inspect them closely...!`
`The card on the right had no distinguishing marks, I couldn't tell which one it was.`
`"...Which one, I wonder... Keiichi-kun... Be careful!"`
`"Yeah, of course! ...This is my chance... for a big comeback!!"`
`Looking closely at the card on the left, I saw a little wear. It wasn't one I hadn't seen before.`
`"Ah... That card is...!!"`
`I didn't let that bit from Satoko slip by me.`
`Mion clucked her tongue.`
`I didn't recognize the mark on the left card from the small number that I had memorized.`
`I didn't know what the left card was, but I could tell from Satoko's reaction that the card had already appeared during the game.`
`Since it had already appeared before, it meant that it definitely wasn't the joker!`
`"...Ooh.`
` Kei-chan thinks it's the one on the right?`
` Will you choose that one then?`
` Will you?"`
`...The left card definitely wasn't the joker. If I could trust that theory, then I should've been able to declare that the card to the right was the joker.`
`Even without Mion's taunting... The one on the right was the most suspicious.`
`But wasn't it a bit too rash to decide based solely on Satoko's reaction!?`
` More... carefully...`
` ...`
` Ah!`
`...I remember now...!!`
` That mark... The left card...`
` No doubt about it!`
` The Seven of Clubs!!!`
`"Hmm...`
` It's the Seven of Clubs, I see..."`
`I've won!`
` The card on the left was the Seven of Clubs!`
`So that meant the card on the right was... the joker!!!!`
`And then, just before my hand touched the right card, I froze.`
`"...Huhuhuh...`
` heheheh...`
` I would expect no less from you."`
`There was a wave of murmurs amongst the onlookers at my sudden halt, right before I confirmed the right card was the joker.`
`"??`
` Huh?`
` What could Keiichi-san possibly be saying??`
` I mean, the left one is..."`
`"...Shh."`
`"Ooh...`
` What makes you so certain that the right one isn't the joker, Kei-chan?"`
`Mion let loose an unexpected question.`
` Everyone else was baffled.`
`"I don't know what the card on the right could be.`
` But I know that the one on the left is the Seven of Clubs."`
`"Then!`
` Doesn't that leave the right one as the joker!?`
` One of them has to be the joker, right!?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...One of those is the joker, right?"`
`"...Keiichi has good intuition."`
`"Huh?`
` Rika-chan, what do you mean by...?"`
`"So basically...`
` the Seven of Clubs...`
` I discarded that by matching it with Satoko's Seven of Spades earlier...!"`
`Everyone's attention snapped to the discard pile at the same time!`
`The truth of the matter couldn't be discerned from that sloppy pile...!`
`"So that means...`
` Mion pocketed one of the discarded cards... then aligned it over the left card... and that means—!!!"`
`"...I see, I get it!`
` This left card... is being disguised as the Seven of Clubs, right!?"`
`It was the first time since the start of the match that a shadow ran across Mion's expression, and I didn't let that slip by.`
`Then... with a grand flourish, I declared it loudly!!`
`"The joker is...`
` ...`
` the left ooooooooooone!!!!!!"`
`It was an intense moment...!`
` That one second felt like an eternity for everyone there.`
`Breaking that silence, the first one to speak... was Mion.`
`"...Being the first president of this club, I've been witness to a variety of performances.`
` Kei-chan...`
` yours is...`
` the best.`
` ...The best of the best of the best!"`
`That was probably the greatest compliment Mion could give.`
` Mion accepted her defeat... dropping the cards from both hands.`
`...My...`
` comeback victory!!!!!!!`
`Rika-chan placed her hand on my head and began petting it, congratulating me on my victory.`
`"Huh...?`
` ...Rika-chan is...?"`
`Rena and Satoko gaped at us... as if they had seen a ghost.`
`"What is it, Rena? It's not as if I cheated or anything, right?? This was fair and square!"`
`"...Rika... only pets someone on the head...to console them."`
`Huh...? What's the meaning of...?`
`At that moment, Rena let out a small shriek.`
`"Ke... Keiichi-kun...!`
` ...This is how it was...!?!?"`
`"You know, Kei-chan.`
` I thought you'd read into it that far.`
` ...Heheheh!"`
`Everyone froze.`
` ...No, it was just me...`
`"It was a gamble.`
` If you had just jumped to conclusions like a little brat, then I would have lost."`
`...It was the answer everyone was certain about...`
`Mion picked up the card from the losing hand...`
`"Kei-chan, you know, you should take pride in this loss."`
`She turned it around...`
`...That was... the card that proclaimed the victor of this duel.`
`The card under the Seven of Clubs`
` ...`
` Unbelievable! It was the Two of Diamonds!`
`I-It was a setup behind the setup...!!`
` If I'd just picked the right one without reading so deeply into it...!`
`"...I, Mion Sonozaki, as the club president...`
` do accept...`
` Keiichi Maebara's membership...into our club...!!!"`
`As I slumped to my knees, dazed, everybody let out a round of applause for the excellent effort I gave despite my defeat.`
`"The match is now over!!`
` Today's victor is me! Mion Sonozaki! And our exalted loser is...`
` Keiichi Maebara~!!!"`
`Everyone made a commotion, applauding cheerfully.`
`I felt I was bested, but I was so soundly beaten that it unexpectedly felt rather refreshing...`
`"When Mii-chan pulled that little trick behind her back I got excited, thinking, 'She's going to do it again!'"`
`"When Keiichi-san stopped the moment before touching the correct card, I thought, 'He fell for it~!'"`
`"...He fell for it quite handily."`
`...Huh?`
`Hey, wait.`
`All of them knew from the start and still got so excited so earnestly...??`
`"...Everyone got excited to make it more fun."`
`...`
` You...`
`"You're all demoooons! You monsters~!!!"`
`"Now, then, Kei-chan... it's time for your penalty...!`
` Since it's your first day participating,`
` I'll go easy, okay?`
` ...It would be a problem if you refused to come to school!"`
`The other three members held down my arms and shoulders firmly.`
`Mion approached, licking her lips...`
`Her right hand went to pull something out of her pocket.`
`That's... a felt-tip marker!! And it's... a giant permanent one!!!`
`"Okay...Here we gooo~!"`
`She took the cap off the marker and brought it slowly up to my face while I was immobilized...!`
`"N-No...`
` NOoOoOoOoo...oo...oo...!!!"`
`I let out my death throes...`
`As soon as the club activities were finished, Rena flew off.`
`Probably so she could dig out that 'kyute' Colonel Sanders that she wasn't able to take home yesterday.`
`So today it was just Mion and me walking home together, a rather rare occurrence.`
`"A mountain of treasure, huh...`
` The guys throwing it away probably never thought in their wildest dreams that Rena would be grateful to them."`
`"Mountain of treasure," meaning that dam construction site from before.`
`...Oh, right. Mion would probably tell me.`
`That murder by dismemberment that seemed to have happened there...`
`"Over there, you know, at that dam construction site.`
` ...Did something happen there?`
` Long ago?"`
`"Something sure did. A grand battle!`
` There were sit-ins and demonstrations!"`
`It was a bit different from what I wanted to hear, but I decided I'd listen just the same.`
`"It was our land that was going to be sunk into the dam reservoir.`
` I would have fought as well, probably."`
`"The government guys were really adamant about it.`
` Acting all big and full of themselves!`
` Since they figured out that they couldn't settle it with money, they did a bunch of nasty stuff!`
` They were nasty guys!"`
`Mion spoke excitedly, as if the whole thing was happening right in front of her.`
`"I'm amazed you guys won... You were facing the federal government, right?"`
`"The mayor and prominent figures in the village all signed petitions.`
` They went to Tokyo and struck deals with legislators...`
` And as a result, the development plan was retracted.`
` It was our complete victory! `
`Ahahahahaha!"`
`"There wasn't any... violence, was there?`
` Like assaults... or murders?"`
`"None."`
`She promptly cut me off.`
`The same as Rena had.`
`Her words signaled the end of discussion.`
`Tomitake-san said, "one arm wasn't found" in the 'incident.'`
`I thought... that a murder by dismemberment had occurred... but I guess I was wrong.`
`My curiosity unsated, I sighed dejectedly inside.`
`"Later. See you tomorrow!`
` Kei-chan! You can't wash that off until you get home, got it!?"`
`"I got it. I won't!"`
`Mion held back her laughter while stealing glances at my face.`
`...I wonder what kind of nasty doodles they drew...`
`Damn you, Mion! You shall rue this day...!`
`If our roles are ever reversed... I'm going to go all out!`
` All over your face so you won't be able to take it off, even with a scouring pad...!!!`
`Upon arriving home, I ran straight into my mom, embarrassing myself yet again...`
`The mood I'd come home to was already on edge.`
`...It's not an uncommon thing in our family.`
`Whenever Dad can't come up with a good idea, it always ends up like this.`
`He stomps around the house with his arms crossed.`
`Mom whispered into my ear.`
`"Welcome home, Keiichi. ...Dad... he's in a bit of a rut right now, so don't bother him, okay?"`
`"He can't come up with a new idea?"`
`"It's because the deadlines are so close together this time.`
` Your dad needs time to recharge or he doesn't work as well."`
`Dad's paintings feed our entire family. If he runs out of ideas, then it's the end of the Maebaras.`
`(...We've never gone hungry before.`
` ...Could it be that my dad... is a master painter??)`
`"...Wouldn't it be easier to get an idea taking a walk outside rather than wandering around the house?"`
`"The theme of the piece this time is 'in the household.'`
` So it seems your dad wants to use this house as a motif."`
`...That's quite a bothersome motif.`
`"...Keiichi!! Tidy your room for once in a while!! It looks terrible!"`
`"S-Sorry! I'll clean it up later!"`
`Ah, come on! Please don't use my room as the motif...!`
`"Keiichi, there's still some time before dinner.`
` So please go take a walk out back or something."`
`Dad's moods are only temporary.`
`As soon as he gets an idea, his mood improves and he starts humming.`
`Until then, it wouldn't be a bad idea to just go take a walk so I don't aggravate him further.`
`"Well, I guess I will then."`
`I said I was going to take a walk, but I didn't have any particular destination in mind.`
`I just needed to kill some time.`
`I got on my bike and pondered where to go.`
`I could just go read at the bookstore, but it would take about an hour by bike to get to town.`
`It would be dark by the time I got back, so I didn't want to go unless I had to.`
`The roads at night here in Hinamizawa creep me out.`
`If Mion or Satoko ever found out about that...`
` I smiled wryly.`
`Oh yeah.`
`Rena was probably still at the mountain of treasure... The dam construction site.`
`The excavation of Colonel Sanders was probably taking her a while.`
`It wouldn't be so bad to have her owe me one.`
`"...She might return the favor next time we have club activities."`
`With a little bit of self-interest in mind, I set off towards the dam construction site.`
`Tomitake-san might be there as well.`
`The only person with information about the incident that both Rena and Mion denied knowing anything about.`
`If I met him again, I'd like to ask for more details...`
`...To ask, "Was there really a dismemberment here in Hinamizawa?"`
`That was my real intention.`
`I spotted Rena struggling up on the slope of the garbage pile.`
`It looked like Colonel Sanders was lodged in there pretty firmly.`
`It didn't look like Rena would be able to excavate him by herself.`
`Realizing that Tomitake-san wasn't around, I began climbing down the slope unsteadily.`
`"Hey, Rena.`
` Looks like you're working up a sweat."`
`"...Whoa,`
` whoa,`
` Keiichi-kun!`
` ...What brings you to a place like this?"`
`A place like this, huh?`
` I see. She was aware of it, at least.`
`"I received a signal for emergency assistance at the accident site!`
` Where is the injured party!?"`
`"Huh!? Huh!?`
` Accident!?`
` ...Huh!?"`
`"But there was a report Colonel Sanders was buried alive in the trash pile...!"`
`"Huh? ...O-Oh, that. You scared me...`
` Don't frighten me like that, Keiichi-kun."`
`"...I was just kidding.`
` I thought you might be struggling by yourself, so I came to help you out."`
`"...Eh? ...You came... for me...?`
` ...Hau."`
`Well, I filled my quota for today.`
`If I don't see Rena blush at least once a day, then I'm not getting my daily required nutritional intake.`
`"Just kidding. You're embarrassing me now!"`
`"...So... huh?`
` ...What part... was the joke? What part was it!?"`
`I just ignored her bewilderment.`
`"Okay, now move out of the way.`
` So where is Colonel Sanders?"`
`"...Ah, sorry!`
` ...Can't you see him... in that gap?"`
`"He's... really buried in there...!!"`
`The Colonel Sanders was sideways, surrounded by boards and other construction materials, like they were caging him inside.`
`According to Rena, it wasn't like this yesterday.`
`It seems as though another illegal dumper came yesterday, dumped again, and now he's buried like this.`
`"...You're trying to move this pile all by yourself...!?`
` With those scrawny arms...!?"`
`There's no way she would be able to do that with her slender arms.`
`"...But... Colonel Sanders... so kyute...`
` There's a chain on the Colonel Sanders at the store... This one, though... I should be able to take this one home...`
` Hau..."`
`If Rena gave up on this Colonel Sanders, she'll probably start devising a plan to steal the one in front of the store...`
`As Rena's guardian, I won't allow her to sully her hands with crime!`
`"Out of the way. I'll do it."`
`Rena blushed again, but this time I left it alone.`
`The pile was enormous.`
`Also, the more days we wasted, the more likely another illegal dumping would occur.`
`If it got buried any deeper, there would be nothing that could be done.`
`"Keiichi-kun, I'll help too. Let me help."`
`"You'd just get in the way, so stay back!`
` Hrrrrnnnnnngh!!"`
`Pulling out scraps,`
` bending them,`
` tossing them aside.`
`I quickly became covered in sweat and dust.`
`Flying objects drew beautiful arcs across the twilight sky, one after another.`
`Lumber,`
` timber,`
` plywood.`
`Damn iiiit!!`
` No matter how much I threw out, there was still more!!`
`Even though I could see Colonel Sanders right there!!`
`After grandstanding like that in front of Rena, I felt frantic because of how little I had progressed.`
`"...If I was going to do this seriously... I'd need an axe or saw or something...!"`
`"That's enough, Keiichi-kun...!`
` You're so sweaty.`
` ...You don't... have to try... so hard..."`
`"I'm just doing it for you, Rena.`
` Don't worry about it."`
`Rena began sputtering and turned beet red.`
`Ah, whoops... I meant to say I was trying my best so as to keep her from becoming a criminal...`
`Oh well.`
`"I guess I just... need a break...!`
` This... is pretty tough...!!"`
`I sprawled on my back over the grassy slope.`
`"I'm so sorry...`
` You're... covered in sweat..."`
`Rena patted her handkerchief against my forehead.`
`It felt pretty nice.`
`"U-Uhm, well, wait here a minute, okay?`
` My house is pretty close.`
` I'll bring you some barley tea, okay?"`
`Leaving the handkerchief on my forehead, Rena took off running.`
`The cries of the higurashi gently cooled the air.`
`After I was certain that Rena was gone, I picked myself up and headed towards what I'd discovered earlier.`
`That was a garbage pile of magazines and newspapers bound up in twine.`
`Unless I'm mistaken...`
` I believe it... was around here...`
`There it was.`
`They were bound stacks of not-so-reputable tabloids.`
`They were stacked chronologically, going back quite a few years.`
`"...It was quite a disturbing incident.`
` ...They still haven't found one of the arms."`
`If it was just as Tomitake-san said, then undoubtedly there would be mention of the murder.`
`These are troubled times.`
` There is no end to these sickening incidents.`
`There's a large part of society drawn in by these incidents, as well.`
`So it had to be recorded.`
` Somewhere.`
`I unfastened the packages and opened the rain-soaked pages carefully, looking over the table of contents.`
`Not here.`
` Next one.`
` Not here.`
` Next one.`
`It was hard to search since I didn't know when it happened.`
`I didn't know who the perpetrator or the victim was, either.`
`I only knew it had happened here.`
`I looked up every so often, checking to see if Rena had come back or not.`
`I wouldn't want her to see me gawking at a dirty magazine, but it wasn't just that.`
`Both Rena and Mion said they didn't know.`
`But it had happened, without a doubt.`
`...As long as Tomitake-san wasn't lying.`
`Then if both Rena and Mion...`
` "Ah. Yeah, there was."`
` If they had just said that, then I wouldn't have gotten so hung up on it.`
`An 'incident' that neither Rena nor Mion wished to talk about.`
`Trying to uncover it after they tried to conceal it out of good intentions...`
`That made me feel like I was acting against my friends.`
`"HINAMIZAWA DAM WORKER LYNCHING! MURDER BY DISMEMBERMENT!!"`
`...Here it is!`
`The featured article was in the back and it seemed that there was a photograph in the colored pages at the front.`
`The pages of the featured article were stuck together and weren't easy to open.`
`Rena could return at any moment.`
`...Feeling rushed, I gave up and opened the photograph page.`
`The police investigators were carrying a body bag and newspaper reporters were all bathing it in camera flashes.`
`The image was blurry and hard to understand, but I could definitely make out the headlines.`
`"A Tragic Nightmare at the Hinamizawa Construction Site! Lynching and Murder/Dismemberment!"`
`"The victim was the site foreman. He had assaulted his assailants daily with..."`
`"An explosive backlash from his daily actions? It's a horrible image, to see the site foreman as..."`
`...It happened...`
` It really did happen...`
`It seemed the details were on the next page.`
`...I turned the page without pausing.`
`...On it was...`
`"The assailants butchered the victim's body with hatchets and pickaxes,`
`then used an axe to split the cadaver into six pieces: the head, arms, legs, and torso."`
`I could understand just from the headline that it was... just too terrible...`
` an incident.`
`Normally a lynching is just assault and murder right...?`
`Dismemberment with hatchets and pickaxes?`
` That wasn't a lynching.`
`It was a merciless killing to the letter, a brutal murder...`
`Done by a group of people.`
`Rena fluttered her arms in a panic, continuing to explain and apologize.`
`It seemed I'd been glaring at her pretty intensely.`
`"I-I'm sorry... I guess my reaction was a bit overboard."`
`"N-No... I-I'm sorry as well! ...I'm sorry!"`
`...Night was drawing close.`
`I was pretty worn out, and it wouldn't hurt to do the rest tomorrow.`
` All right?"`
`"...Okay."`
`"Why do you look so glum? Tomorrow we'll be digging out Colonel Sanders, right!?"`
`"You're right. ...Ahahaha!`
` I really want to take Colonel Sanders home soon~!"`
`We both knew that it was useless to apologize any more than that.`
`I quenched my thirst with the barley tea Rena brought and wiped off the sweat that had now gone cold. We took the path to head home.`
`I felt quite guilty about the tabloid wrapped up in my jacket.`
