`"... So, Rena, we're the same age?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's right.`
` We're the same zodiac animal, too."`
`Hey, now, it would be weird if we were the same age but not the same zodiac animal.`
`"That's not true.`
` If your birthday isn't the same then you can have different animals even if you're the same age!"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, I see~`
` Mion, you're pretty smart!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` What month were you born, by the way, Keiichi-kun?`
` I'm July!"`
`Rena smirked and puffed up with pride.`
`... Hey, now, what's the meaning of this?`
`She's not planning to be all high and mighty if her birthday is a wee bit sooner than mine, is she...`
`"...Heh!`
` Don't even.`
` It's impossible to challenge me by birthday!!`
` ... I wouldn't even mind you if you bet 100 yen per month!"`
`"Huh?`
` Huh!?`
` Why?`
` Why!?"`
`Rena panicked at suddenly being challenged to a wager.`
`... Given how panicked she is, I am certain she doesn't have much allowance left this month.`
`It's just... Sending her into a panic about something as simple as a birthday is so fun, I can't help myself.`
`"So that means you were born in April, Kei-chan?"`
`"Right on!`
` Too bad, Rena!`
` I'm already far older than Rena."`
`"Oh!`
` I see!`
` Then you're the same age as Mii-chan!"`
`"Well, it's just a few months~.`
` That gap will open up again soon enough~!"`
`Mion snickered through her nose.`
`... Hey, now, that's not something to get all high and mighty about.`
` As if I'm one to talk (heh).`
`"... Now that you mention it... You're in a higher grade, right, Mion?"`
`"If you're into underclassmen, then I can be an underclassman from now on!"`
`"Mii-chan, you're not making any sense to me..."`
`Just by seeing Rena's blushing face, you could tell she knew exactly what she meant by it, though...`
`"Then Satoko and Rika-chan are underclassmen.`
` ... Their grade is so different that they should be in a different school, shouldn't they?"`
`"Ke... Keiichi-kun, your tastes are a bit too young, I think...`
` I think..."`
`You're not making any sense yourself, Rena...`
`I'll just grab onto her head and scruff it up a bit.`
`"Hau~~~!! S~t~o~p~ i~t~~...!"`
`"I wondered about it before, yeah.`
` I was wondering why this school has different school years all mixed up."`
`"There aren't enough classrooms.`
` Can't help it.`
` This building is being rented from the forestry services, after all~."`
`... When she says it like that, it makes sense.`
` I've thought our school was strange for a while now.`
`The school yard is gravel, there are rooms that aren't for classes, and there's some strange sort of construction machinery parked here.`
`"Why is it being borrowed?`
` What happened to the real school?"`
`"There was one here forever from before the war...`
` It got dilapidated.`
` They closed it down."`
`It probably was a grand old school house.`
`"Well, because of that, the students would have to attend the school in the city.  That's pretty far, though, you know?"`
`"Which school would that be?"`
`"Did you know there's a school if you pass by the Okinomiya train station, turn at the hospital, and head towards the pediatrics department?"`
`"W-Whaaaa!?!?`
` S-So far...!"`
`I couldn't tell where that was by the location, but I understood it was pretty far from Rena's reaction.`
`"Well, that's why.`
` The guys that didn't want to commute to Okinomiya rented out the building from the forestry services, and are attending this pseudo school house here."`
`"About half the children in Hinamizawa go here.`
` There are quite a lot of kids that come here on bike."`
`"Well, since they're attending this really messed-up school, it might be pretty hard for them to get into higher education."`
`"That's not true, Mii-chan.`
` If you study properly, you can go anywhere you want."`
`"Yeah, that's right, that's right!`
` I totally agree with Rena on this one!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` That's right!`
` Let's try our best!"`
`"All of you, try your best.`
` This old man will be rooting for you."`
`"Not just us! You, too!`
` You should be preparing for exams, shouldn't you!?`
` Your future is bleak with grades like this!"`
`"Fine, just fine.`
` If I get stuck, then I'll just mooch off Kei-chan as he works forever."`
`"Wh-wh-what do you mean by mooch off Kei-chan!?`
` What do you mean!?"`
`"Hey!`
` You're too loud!`
` Be quiet during self study!"`
`The teacher yelled at all three of us.`
`It was completely our fault...`
`Satoko saw it and chortled haughtily.`
`I stuck out my tongue at her in response.`
`... It is just as Mion says.`
` This school has nothing to do with higher education.`
`But it makes up for that by having lots of valuable things other schools don't.`
