`Weariness and a headache.`
`Not a very nice way to start the day...`
`"What's wrong?`
` Keiichi.`
` ...You don't look so well.`
` When did you go to sleep?"`
`It seemed that my mom had noticed my sullen state.`
`...Yesterday... I kept on waking up in the middle of the night.`
`Without a doubt, I felt a presence.`
`...I felt the presence of someone standing in front of my door.`
`I told myself repeatedly that it was my imagination and forced myself to try and sleep.`
`Except... not being able to stand it, I gathered up my courage and opened the door.`
`...Of course there wasn't anyone there.`
`I think I did this three times throughout the night.`
`...Or maybe I just didn't remember doing it any more than that...`
`Even though I was able to get to the breakfast table without incident, I still didn't feel at ease.`
`"It might be a cold.`
` ...I don't really have an appetite."`
`"...My.`
` ...You do seem a little warm...`
` Well?`
` Can you make it to school?"`
`Technically I did go to a school... but it was mostly self study.`
` ...It wouldn't matter much if I missed a day, would it?`
`It could have been that I hadn't been feeling well for the last few days because I really did have a cold.`
`If I took some medicine and got a good day of rest... I might be able to greet everyone with a smile tomorrow.`
`Ding dong...!`
`Startled, I looked back and forth between the entrance and the clock.`
`...It was ten minutes later than when I usually met up with Rena.`
` ...It was Rena.`
`"Rena-chan came to get you... what are you going to do?`
` Are you going to take the day off?"`
`...Rena was a good girl.`
` She might be somewhat quirky, but she was certainly cute.`
` The lunches she made were delicious and she always looked out for me.`
`...Why should I be so scared of something like that...?`
`It wasn't Rena's fault.`
`It was probably mine...`
`It had to have been my cold.`
` ...It just had to be.`
`"I'll rest.`
` ...Sorry."`
`"Then I'll go send her off for you."`
`Mom headed off to the door.`
`...I would have to pass by the entrance to get back to my room.`
`I didn't have the nerve to meet with Rena... so I wrapped myself in a blanket on the sofa and closed my eyes.`
`I was so sleep-deprived, I quickly fell into a deep slumber...`
`I had only intended to lie down for a bit, but it was almost noon when I woke up.`
`I called out to my parents, but they didn't seem to be around. On the table, I found lunch prepared and a note.`
`Mom and Dad had apparently driven off to somewhere far away.`
`It likely had to do with Dad's work.`
`This happened every so often, so it wasn't that unusual.`
`They would be back for dinner, but might be a bit late.`
`On the note, it said:`
`"The insurance card is in the cabinet. Take it and go to the hospital."`
`There was also a well-drawn map to the hospital.`
`...That's right.`
` I hadn't been there before, so I didn't know exactly where it was.`
`I had a light lunch... although it really was just leftovers from the morning... and, just in case, went to the hospital.`
`Normally I'd never be here... in the middle of a weekday.`
` ...Just walking around like this had me feeling guilty. It was an odd feeling.`
`Following my mom's map, I took a road I usually never used. After walking for a bit, the hospital's sign came into view.`
`"Irie Clinic" was written rather stylishly on the sign.`
`The clinic wasn't very big, but based on the scale of the rest of Hinamizawa, it was far too grand.`
`There was a parking lot and even a reserved spot for buses.`
` ...They must be making a mint.`
`I spaced out in the air-conditioned waiting room until it was my turn to be seen...`
`"Maebara-san, please make your way to the examination room."`
`After half-heartedly answering all of the chatty doctor's questions, he responded with the old "it's probably a cold."`
`They gave me a shot and three days worth of medicine.`
`...I thought it was a little overboard, but if it would clear away the gloomy feeling I'd been having lately, then it was worth it.`
`I settled the bill and took a quick trip to the washroom. As I was leaving, I overheard a conversation between some elderly people who seemed to be regulars at the clinic.`
`Of course, I had no intention of eavesdropping.`
` ...If it just wasn't for that word...`
`"...must have been an Onikakushi."`
`"I wonder...`
` She was still pretty young,`
` might've just eloped."`
`"With whom?"`
`"That man from Tokyo who visits every season.`
` That young one with that big camera.`
` Didn't you know they were getting along pretty well?"`
`...Were they talking about Tomitake-san!?`
`I could feel my ears perking up.`
`"I don't know about that...`
` But... you have to make preparations before you elope.`
` Leave a note or quit their job or something."`
`"It's an elopement because they didn't leave a note or message."`
`"...The thought that I'll never see that young nurse's face again makes me rather sad..."`
`"Takano-san is an upstanding young woman.`
` ...She'll be fine wherever she goes."`
`So her name was Takano-san?`
` ...That woman with Tomitake-san.`
` And... she worked at this clinic...!?`
`Oyashiro-sama's shadow was following me everywhere I went.`
`I started listening more closely, but they began talking about fishing and it didn't seem like they were going to revisit the topic. I gave up and left.`
`Thus, even though I was separated from the daily monotony of school, I wasn't able to escape from Oyashiro-sama's shadow.`
`...But of course.`
`Oyashiro-sama was the guardian deity of this place...`
` of Hinamizawa.`
`As long as I was in Hinamizawa, I wouldn't be able to escape...`
`Maybe it was because I was walking outside, but my appetite had suddenly returned.`
`I might as well buy a snack with the change from the examination fee on the way home.`
`Contemplating that, I turned onto a familiar street.`
`At that moment, I heard a car horn abruptly honk behind me.`
`...Was I really walking so far into the middle of the road where I'd be in a car's way?`
`I moved farther off to the side, but the horn was still honking at me. I turned around, peeved.`
`"Maebara-san,`
` good day to you."`
`It was Ooishi-san.`
` He stepped out of his car, AC on full blast, and waved at me.`
`"What's up today?`
` School on break?"`
`"J-Just not feeling well, so I took the day off.`
` ...I was about to buy lunch and head back home."`
`"That's great.`
` I'm just about to get lunch myself.  Would you mind going together?`
` ...Ah, if you're not feeling up for it, then don't mind me."`
`I was just going to lie down after going home anyway.`
`...And I didn't really have a cold.`
`"I expect you'd rather avoid using one of the local places.`
` Let's go into town.`
` It's a bit of a drive, is that all right?`
` I know a pretty good place."`
`I'd finally begun to understand Ooishi-san's roundabout way of saying things.`
`...He probably wanted to talk to me about stuff that would be difficult to discuss while in Hinamizawa.`
`I went with Ooishi-san, riding in his frigid car.`
`It was almost as if the bright sunlight outside was a lie.`
`"I'm sorry about calling you so late last night.`
` Did your parents get angry at you?"`
`"No..."`
`I recalled Rena, who had been listening to the phone conversation all that time, separated from me by just the door.`
`...Even now, in the brightness of the sunlight... the thought still creeped me out.`
`With a big bump that jolted the car, the road connecting to the city changed from dirt to pavement.`
`My head swiveled back with a sudden realization.`
` That's right...`
` This was where Tomitake-san died.`
`"...They've hit a snag on the investigation regarding Tomitake-san."`
`Ooishi-san spoke while peering at me from the corner of his eye.`
`"They believed it was caused by hallucinogens, given how he was clawing out his own throat`
` ...But a drug that could cause that to happen so suddenly... is extremely hard to come by.`
`Bear in mind, of course, the autopsy was done with that premise in mind... but we didn't find any leads."`
`"Um... you know that thing you see in comics all the time?`
` Where there's a drug that doesn't leave any traces after being consumed..."`
`"It exists.`
` Succinylchol-something-or-other.`
` Well, it's pretty common.`
`But you see. There doesn't seem to be any kind of drug that would cause Tomitake-san to react like that."`
`"...Then... you're saying the police concluded Tomitake-san just died from the curse!?"`
`I couldn't help but feel that the police were worthless.`
`...I just wanted the idea of a curse to be dissociated from Tomitake-san's mysterious death.`
`"Unfortunately, that's how it looks right now.`
` But putting aside the cause of death... Without a doubt, he was surrounded by a group of people and had taken a beating before he died. `
`That was no curse, but an incident that unquestionably involved other humans."`
`That made me a bit.. relieved.`
`We passed in front of the rather desolate (but still busier than Hinamizawa) train station.`
`The car pulled into a restaurant parking lot and I followed Ooishi-san into the shop.`
`It was pretty crowded, but there were only adults at this hour. Of course there wouldn't be children in here in the middle of a weekday.`
`"Two, please. I'll... make do with non-smoking."`
`"This way, please.`
` When you are ready to order, please call me over."`
`We were led by a peculiarly dressed waitress to our table. I sat with Ooishi-san in the booth.`
`"So what do you think?`
` Aren't the waitresses' outfits here cute?"`
`"Huh?`
` Well... um... I guess??"`
`"...This shop is always quite busy.`
` It's more about the waitresses than the food, you see~."`
`"Uh huh.`
` ...Ooishi-san... you're leering."`
`"Hmm?`
` Am I really?`
` Murhuhuhuhuh...!"`
`...Regardless of how the waitresses looked, the food was decent enough...`
`Finishing our meals while talking about some inane topic, Ooishi-san's after-meal cup of coffee arrived at the table.`
`"Yesterday, we talked about Hinamizawa's past, didn't we?"`
`"Yeah. That it was the village of man-eating demons... or something like that."`
`"I didn't know much about it myself, so I asked my mother about it this morning."`
`Ooishi-san took out the notepad that was stuffed into his breast pocket.`
`"Turns out that Hinamizawa used to be called Onigafuchi—the Demon's Abyss."`
`"Onigafuchi...`
` ...That's quite the name..."`
`"The name is still around.`
` ...The swamp where the Shinto priest's wife drowned herself is still called Onigafuchi.`
` ...It's said that the depths of that swamp connect to the realm of demons."`
`Of course, nobody had told me anything about such an ominous swamp...`
`"And you see,`
` it appears they were both feared and revered."`
`A respect born of fear...`
` I guess you could say it was a kind of deification.`
`A village of inhuman creatures.`
`"Seems the demons were Sennin—or mountain-dwelling mystics—of sorts.`
`Villagers with incurable illnesses would be taken to Onigafuchi to be healed, for example."`
`Even if we are calling them demons... Tengu—long-nosed goblins—or Sennin would be a more apt description.`
`"They don't seem like such terrible people, even though they were called demons."`
`"But they were still man-eating demons.`
` According to the story my mother told me... as payment for treating the son's illness, 'Let us eat the mother who brought him here!'`
` ...Was apparently how things went."`
`"...The price of curing her son... was herself!?`
` ...That's unsettling."`
`"Of course the mother took her son and ran.`
` Then, you see...`
` All the villagers of Onigafuchi -`
`the demons- chased, surrounded, and captured them."`
`The entire village...`
` apparently.`
`...That's quite a frightening thing to imagine.`
`"In the end, it seems both the mother and son were caught and eaten.`
` The end."`
`"There's a problem with this story.`
` ...Both witnesses in this story were eaten, so nobody would be able to tell the tale."`
`"Huuh?`
` ...Bwahahaha! There are plenty of old fables like this."`
`In contrast to the ghastly tale, Ooishi-san laughed heartily while sipping his coffee.`
`"But, well...`
` ...There are quite a few other tales.`
` Where the demons from Onigafuchi band together to capture their prey."`
`I recalled that Mion said all the villagers united and fought against the dam construction.`
`...I saw similarities with how that part about unification overlapped.`
`"They would always hunt down a single person, and they chose who it was going to be beforehand."`
`"...Huh?"`
`That caught my attention.`
`...Ooishi-san also appeared to be pondering what it meant.`
`"My mother told me that you must never interfere with the 'demon's hunt.'`
` You should just hole up in your house and hide under the covers, she said."`
`"...So what does this all mean?"`
`"It means you mustn't ever help or protect the prey.`
` As long as you don't disturb the demon's hunt, no harm will fall upon the villagers.`
` It seems there's that kind of rule."`
`Basically... don't help the victims.`
`Pretend you didn't see the atrocities... in other words...`
`"What happens if you break the rule?"`
`"Well...`
` they're man-eating demons, after all..."`
`Many parts of that tale caught my attention.`
`...Parts of the story he told me overlapped with his theory that the entire village was in on the crime.`
`Even if it wasn't the whole village... it was conceivable that the villagers were "hiding under the covers and leaving them to die" when there's a group that was on their 'hunt,' wasn't it...???`
`I didn't dare speak it.`
`"...Then, Ooishi-san... I guess it looks like it's either the entire village or a group of villagers perpetrating the crimes...?"`
`"What do you think, Maebara-san?`
` ...Ah, excuse me.`
` Another cup of coffee, please."`
`That's what I wanted to know.`
`...It seemed that... we were both waiting for the other to say that last part...`
`He waited for the waitress to finish pouring coffee before speaking.`
`"...Last year, I had a nagging feeling when Satoshi-kun disappeared."`
`Ooishi-san muttered as he watched the milk swirl around in his coffee.`
`"So those friends of Satoshi-san... meaning your group of friends, Maebara-san... I had a bit—`
` Really just a little bit, okay?`
` —of background checking done on them."`
`If Ooishi-san had said this to me before... I would've gotten angry at him for calling my friends into question...`
` But as I was now, I couldn't...`
`"This might sound pretty stupid.`
` Maebara-san, if you feel that it's stupid, please say so.`
` I'll just stop."`
`Ooishi-san was wearing the most serious expression that I'd ever seen from him.`
`...It was as if he was telling me to prepare myself and listen.`
`There were quite a few things I regretted hearing from Ooishi-san.`
`...But... none of them were as threatening as this...`
`A little voice inside me was screaming like an alarm...!`
`Stop, Keiichi.`
` This was probably the last one...!`
`I took a deep breath and silenced that voice.`
`...I would not run from the truth.`
`"...Please."`
`That was all I could utter.`
`...Ooishi-san stared into my eyes silently for a few moments. After he was certain I was ready, he began.`
`"The victim of the incident in the first year was the overseer. A few weeks prior, he had an altercation with Mion Sonozaki-san.`
` Multiple altercations."`
`...Ooishi-san had said before that Mion had defied the dam project vehemently.`
`...Well, it wasn't hard to imagine how she'd be if she got worked up.`
`"In the second year, the married couple who supported the project died in that accident, right?`
` Their daughter was with them at the time...`
` Her name is Satoko Houjou-san."`
`"Huh!?`
` Satoko, meaning...`
` Satoko!?!?"`
`Ooishi-san's look told me that my voice was too loud.`
` ...I realized it as well, and quickly quieted down.`
`"The Shinto priest and his wife who died in the third year. You see...`
` their daughter is Rika Furude-san."`
`"...Rika-chan...was--!?!?"`
`"The housewife who died in the fourth year you know already, don't you?`
` It was the step-aunt of Satoko Houjou-san.`
` ...She was in her aunt and uncle's custody, as she had lost both of her parents in the accident... `
`She lived in the victim's house."`
`I could tell my lips were getting dry.`
`I... didn't even have the wits to keep my mouth from hanging agape.`
`I had thought it was nothing but a bizarre incident... one that I could easily distance myself from.`
`...But, clicking and clacking... it had snuck all the way to my feet...`
`"The one who disappeared the fourth year, by the way... he was Satoko-san's older brother."`
`"Wha... just... ah... wait... just a second..."`
`It took everything I had to finally say that.`
`...I gulped down a glass of water and once again wiped my face with a napkin...`
`Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!`
`But Ooishi-san was relentless.`
`...Instead of waiting for me to finish sorting out my feelings, he started speaking again.`
`The last of the things I shouldn't have heard...`
`"All of the victims seem to be connected to your group of friends."`
`"...That has to be just a coincidence!!"`
`"Maebara-san, keep it down...`
` Everyone's looking..."`
`Mion...?`
` Satoko!?`
` Rika-chan!?`
`So what if they're connected!?`
`You're telling me, all of my friends...!?!?`
`It couldn't be... it just couldn't be...`
` ...Oh, Rena is different, isn't she!?`
`Rena isn't connected with the victims at all.`
`"Rena Ryuugu-san was living in a suburb of Ibaraki prefecture up until last year.`
` Well, it's true she hadn't directly met any of the victims..."`
`He said it in a roundabout way.`
`Is he saying she's also connected...!?`
`"Actually, I looked into her. Before Ryuugu-san moved away to Hinamizawa, she was suspended from school.`
` It seems she went through her school building and broke all of the windows."`
`"R-Rena did that!?`
` ...She broke all the windows at her school!?!?"`
`That... same, spacey... Rena had...!?`
`I couldn't even imagine it.`
`"It seems that, after her three day suspension, she didn't return to school.`
` She went to a neurologist and was diagnosed with dysautonomia. She was given weeks of counseling and medication."`
`I wonder if it was something like a nervous breakdown.`
`... I'd heard that it happens to people who are really methodical or overly sensitive.`
`...Neither of those matched Rena's easygoing personality...`
`"...and in the counselor's medical report, he recorded all of the conversations he had with Rena-san...`
` 'It' shows up...`
` And quite a bit at that."`
`"What did...?"`
`I pressed forward carelessly.`
`...There couldn't be anything more for me to regret...`
`"She mentioned...`
` the word, 'Oyashiro-sama.'"`
`It felt like someone's stone cold hand was caressing my back...`
`...Why... why had Rena spoken of Oyashiro-sama before she even came to Hinamizawa...!?`
`"Seems that the Oyashiro-sama she spoke of was like a ghost, appearing in her house every night.`
` Standing over her pillow, looking down at her."`
`...My mind froze.`
`...I couldn't process... what I was being told...`
`"A while after that, she moved to Hinamizawa.`
` ...Ah, that's right.`
` She's not an outsider."`
`"Huh?"`
`"According to their residency register, the Ryuugu family used to reside in Hinamizawa.`
` They moved to Ibaraki just as Rena-san entered elementary school."`
`My mind went completely blank...`
`...It was similar to the static you'd see on a blank TV channel...`
`My ears began ringing as I lost all sense of comprehension...`
`"...Maebara-san, are you all right?`
` Shall we stop?"`
`Those words brought me back.`
` ...I couldn't let it end here...!`
`"...Now I know about Rena...`
` Then... how about the last victim, Tomitake-san?`
` ...Who was he connected with...?"`
`Irritated, I let out one final reprisal.`
`"...All of them.`
` Have you forgotten, Maebara-san?`
` Didn't you all spend the night of the festival together quite merrily?`
` Quite a few of the officers saw you enjoying yourselves."`
`...Now there was nothing I could respond with...`
`...I fell silent as my brain turned to mush...`
`"We should get going.`
` Ah, Maebara-san, did you take your afternoon medicine?"`
`I had completely forgotten about the medicine I had gotten today until Ooishi-san said that...`
`I got another glass of water, and we left the shop after I chugged it down.`
`We got in the car and returned to Hinamizawa via the rough road.`
`...I never really paid attention when I was on my bike, but did cars normally shake this much...?`
`...It was almost as if the road was desperately trying to tell me something.`
`*Badump*`
`...That big jolt was from the difference in elevation of the road when it changed from cement to dirt.`
`I was certain that I heard Tomitake-san's scream...`
`I sat in silence, just letting myself be shaken by the car...`
`"I'll drop you off at your house.`
` ...You missed school because you were ill, correct?`
` My apologies for the long conversation."`
`"...Why did you talk to me?"`
` I blurted out the question.`
`...Really just blurted it out.`
` I didn't expect an answer.`
`"I did check with you first, didn't I?`
` If we should just stop..."`
`"Not that!`
` ...Why did you reach out to me?"`
`...I understood quite well that Ooishi-san was investigating this string of suspicious incidents.`
`But... why was he telling me all this...?`
`I knew nothing and I couldn't help.`
` Everything Ooishi-san spoke of was news to me.`
`...First of all... what could I, having just moved here, possibly know?`
`By chance... If there was a reason for Ooishi-san to reach out to me, then it would have to be...`
`...That I was part of Mion's circle of friends, who looked suspicious to Ooishi-san...`
`"...I'm retiring this year.`
` I plan on moving away after retiring as my mother wants.`
` So while I'm still on the case, I want to bring the truth behind this incident to light."`
`"...So... Ooishi-san, you suspect them, don't you?`
` All of them."`
`Ooishi-san didn't really give a response.`
`It felt a little late, but I thought it was his way of showing a bit of consideration for my feelings.`
`"This is... mostly my intuition from 30 years on this job.`
` ...Maebara-san. You're the one in danger."`
`"...Huh?"`
`I wanted to reply with "that's absurd!," but in my downtrodden state I couldn't bring myself to say it.`
`"I'll be retiring this year, so I won't be at the Watanagashi next year.`
` ...So I want to settle things."`
`In other words, he was insinuating that on the next Watanagashi, I might be the victim...`
`"I've been warned by the chief as well.`
` 'Each incident in the string of cases has been solved, so don't bring it up again,' or so I was told...`
` This is the pressure that I'm facing..."`
`"Pressure... from what?"`
`"Someone in Hinamizawa.`
` ...We've arrived.`
` Is this fine?"`
`After some time, the car finally reached the path to my house.`
` The clock read 2pm.`
` ...I was surprised so little time had passed since we ate.`
`It was hot outside the car.`
` The chirping of the higurashi hurt my ears.`
`"I won't mind if you just forgot everything I told you today.`
` ...But I'm still going to keep investigating.`
` I'll end Oyashiro-sama's curse this year."`
`"...So you're saying I should contact you if anything happens?"`
`"It's fine.`
` ...Just contact me when you feel you have to, Maebara-san."`
`I wasn't collected enough to understand Ooishi-san's roundabout way of saying it.`
`"Be sure to take it easy.`
` ...I'm sorry for throwing all this at you while you're taking the day off because you're sick."`
`I didn't really give any sort of response.`
`"I'll always be on your side.`
` ...If anything, believe that.`
` I'll be off now."`
`The tires crunched over the dirt road as the car made a U-turn and disappeared into a cloud of kicked-up dust.`
`It felt like I was watching a boat only throw me a lifesaver in shark-infested waters before disappearing into the distance.`
`...That was the first time I thought Ooishi-san was being unfair.`
`Telling me I was going to be the next victim, then just saying to contact him if something happened.`
`...This wasn't a criminal investigation.`
`He was fishing.`
`...And I was just the bait dangling off the line.`
`Would the fish be the perpetrator?`
` Or was it really just Oyashiro-sama's curse?`
`...Either way, the bait would be swallowed whole...`
`"...Damn it... I don't want to die..."`
`For some time, I could do nothing but stare at the puddle of water left behind by the AC from the car...`
`I wonder how much time had passed since I laid down.`
`It was getting dark outside.`
`My body was soaked in sweat.`
` ...It would probably be a good idea to change my sheets.`
`At that moment, the phone downstairs rang.`
`It was probably Mom.`
`Mom was quite the worrywart.`
` ...Maybe she had called many times but I just didn't notice it...`
`"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."`
`"Oh, he's alive! Hello!`
` This is Mion.`
` How you doing~?"`
`"Hm, is this one of Keiichi's friends?`
` Keiichi is resting now, but...`
` shall I put him on?"`
`"Huh!?`
` I-I-Is this his dad??`
` Ahahahaha, s-s-sorry!!"`
`"Bwahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Idiot~!`
` You fell for it!"`
`"Huh!?`
` K-Kei-chaaaaAAAaaaaaAAan!!"`
`After our exchange, we both had a good laugh together.`
`...Except I was suspicious of her even as we were laughing...`
`...Was everybody... really involved in the incidents...?`
`...The fact that I couldn't say "no," saddened me.`
`"I'm relieved that you seem well.`
` Rena was really worried, you know?`
` Satoko-chan was happy and said you got what you deserved!`
` Rika-chan said, 'how unfortunate he's sick!'"`
`"Heh, looks like everyone was making a big deal out of it!"`
`"Well, you know. So Kei-chan...`
` Is now a bad time to come pay you a visit?"`
`"A visit?`
` No, it's okay. It's not like I'm dying."`
`"My grandma made a ton of mochi, you see.`
` I was told to share them.`
` So I'll bring you some!"`
`"...Hey now, you'll catch my cold."`
`"Not to worry! Both Rena and I are too stupid to catch a cold!`
` See you!`
` Be there in a bit!"`
`She hung up cheerfully.`
`Rena's coming too?`
`That's what it sounded like.`
`...I was still concerned about meeting Rena, but I guess if she was with Mion...`
`I heard the doorbell ten minutes later.`
`"How are you feeling?`
` Did you take your medicine and rest~?"`
`"I did just that."`
`"Th-Thank goodness you look well. I was worried..."`
`"Sorry... I'll be fine by tomorrow."`
`Mion showed a complete lack of concern for someone who's recovering, and Rena looked like she was worried about me from the bottom of her heart.`
`...It didn't look like there was anything behind those expressions.`
`"...I thought we might hang out for a bit, but it looks like you're not quite in the condition for it."`
`"Hm? Y-You don't say!?"`
`It seemed my face appeared a bit sullen.`
`"...Then here, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...These are the mochi Mii-chan's grandma made."`
`Rena held out the package wrapped in newspaper.`
`There might be about five in here.`
`...It was quite hefty.`
`"Ah, thanks. Send my regards to your grandma, Mion."`
`"Yep.`
` Ah, there's one that I made in there as well!`
` I wonder if Keiichi-kun can guess which one..."`
`"This is Kei-chan's homework since he missed the club meeting today!`
` There are letters on each mochi, so I'll ask you tomorrow!"`
`"W-Were you checking if I was feeling better or did you just come here for club activities!?!"`
`"Yep, yep, looking fine. Guess you'll be able to make it tomorrow~."`
`"Man, what are you going to do if my fever comes back because of your shenanigans?"`
`"M-Mii-chan, we shouldn't be making such a racket...`
` Let's go.`
` The other people here will get angry."`
`...Both of them thought my parents were home.`
`It was because the entranceway was a mess.`
`"You're right, let's get going.`
` ...Ah, by the way, Kei-chan."`
`"Yeah?"`
`"What did you eat for lunch?"`
`The sudden question startled me and I went wide-eyed when I saw Mion.`
`...I had never seen her like that... it was a highly unsettling visage.`
`But... why... is she asking me about what I ate for lunch...?`
`What she said was so inane it was almost meaningless.`
`...The way she said it, it was almost like she didn't even care at all about what I ate.`
`"I-I ate out..."`
`...She must have suspected that I was with Ooishi-san...`
`Anyway, I felt that if I hesitated or tried to change the subject then they'd read too deep into it... so I tried answering as quickly as possible.`
`Except... contrary to the efforts I had made... there was a pause before they replied.`
`"...Hmm, so you ate out for lunch, Keiichi-kun."`
`The glimmer from Rena's eyes had changed at some point, as well.`
`...It was now sharp... as if to make me feel the feigned ignorance behind her words even more.`
`...As if she already knew... that's how it looked to me.`
`"Well? Was it good?"`
`"...Wh-Why are you asking me this...?"`
`Mion was speaking in an unusually low tone.`
`...Almost as if... she knew that I had eaten at the restaurant in town...`
`No... I'm overthinking this.`
`...I mean... both of them should have been in school at lunchtime.`
`...There was no way they could have known where I was...`
`"Seems you were with a rather austere-looking older guy.`
` ...Who was he?"`
`Flop.`
`The package with the mochi I was holding slipped out of my hands.`
`I could tell the blood had drained from my face, making me go pale.`
`"...Oh?`
` Keiichi-kun, who was he?`
` ...Could it be the person from before, I wonder?`
` ...I wonder!?"`
`I could feel the back of my throat going dry...`
`This was no longer a bluff.`
`...They... knew everything...!?`
`"H... How... do you... know that...?"`
`It took everything I had to finally force those words from my throat.`
`...My knees were shaking.`
`"...Because...`
` ...there's nothing this old man doesn't know."`
`...Mion sneered knowingly... and her laugh seemed to carry on forever.`
`"So, Kei-chan, what did you talk about?`
` It seems like you got pretty worked up over it, too..."`
`"W-We weren't talking about you guys...!`
` It didn't have anything to do with you or Rena...!"`
`"Hmm?`
` ...Isn't it a bit strange to hear our names come up even though nobody asked about that, hmmm?"`
`Rena's unwavering gaze pierced through my eyes and peered further inside me.`
`I'd dug my own grave.`
` ...My heart was throbbing so much, it felt like it was going to explode...`
`"Well, whatever you're trying to hide... This old man already sees through it all.`
` Remember that."`
`"..."`
`I couldn't even shake my head.`
`...It took everything I had to stop my teeth from chattering...`
`She never let her gaze break from mine, even as she tilted her head slightly.`
`"...Keiichi-kun, you don't look so good.`
` I think you should lie down."`
`"That's true. We should both head back home."`
`As if nothing had happened, they both giggled at each other and started making their way out.`
`I hadn't moved a muscle since I had dropped the package of mochi.`
`As they left, the door slowly closed behind them.`
`...All I could do was stare.`
` ...As if I couldn't move until the door was completely closed.`
`Just as the door was just about closed, it opened again slightly with a sudden creak, sending my heart racing once again.`
`A single eye peered in through that narrow slit, and Mion's hawkish gaze peered at me once again.`
`"See you, Kei-chan."`
`"...Y... Yeah..."`
`"...I'd 'hate it' if you missed school tomorrow, alright?"`
`Thud.`
`...The door closed.`
`I wasn't able to move a muscle even after their low laughter died off into the distance and silence once again enveloped the room...`
`Coming back to my senses, the first thing I did was lock the door...`
`They knew what Ooishi-san and I talked about...!?`
`Why...!?`
` How!?`
`No... that wasn't important...`
`Thinking about it now... All of it could have been overheard... from the beginning when Ooishi-san met me.`
` ...Just as Mion said... I couldn't hide anything...`
`Then... what were they... trying to tell me...?`
`...That part was obvious.`
`They were warning me not to say anything 'unnecessary.'`
`What did they deem unnecessary...?`
`I only talked with Ooishi-san about one thing.`
` ...And they were warning me that that was unnecessary.`
`What was it that Ooishi-san talked to me about...?`
` The incidents involving Oyashiro-sama's curse that occurred every year weren't individual cases...`
` but were connected as a whole...`
` As well as the fact that there may be multiple perpetrators hidden within Hinamizawa...`
`No... more precisely...`
`...that Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika-chan were all suspicious.`
`Is that what they are warning me against...?`
`"Wh... What kind of nonsense am I thinking about!?"`
`I hit my own face hard enough that it let out a loud slap.`
`...If only that would wake me from this nightmare... But for some reason it felt like I was punching a blanket... it was almost laughably painless.`
`Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!`
`When did I become such a pessimist?`
`Calm down. Calm down!`
`Settle down and sort things out...!`
`The reason Mion knew I was eating lunch with Ooishi-san was probably because... somebody from Hinamizawa just happened to be there at the time.`
`They must have told Mion that I was there...`
`That made the most sense.`
`Plus... come to think of it... She didn't ask me where I ate lunch, did she?`
`...She only asked, "was it good?"...!`
`They were just curious since I was together with someone not from Hinamizawa... It's not... as if they had any ulterior motives...`
` That's it. That has to be it...!`
`Thinking about it that way, it was the same with Rena.`
`I was just being strangely ambiguous about when I met with Ooishi-san, and Rena was just correcting me on that.`
`That's when I was bewildered by the change in character from the usual mild-mannered Rena... and was just startled by it...`
` That's the most natural way of thinking about it...!`
`...It felt like my mind was mixed up like a tangled mess of spaghetti.`
`...Deep red marinara sauce would have poured out of my nose and ears if you squeezed my head.`
`Thinking that, I suddenly felt like vomiting.`
`...I really didn't want that to happen, so I stopped holding my head...`
`Lately, I had no idea what anyone was saying...`
`Spending time with them was fun.`
` It didn't feel like there was any sort of hidden agenda.`
` I really do think that they're a good bunch of people...`
`When I just moved here and couldn't make heads or tails of everything, they were really kind to me.`
`Rena was really kind and always looked after me.`
` As long as that strange affliction didn't rear its ugly head, she was really pretty cute.`
`Mion is also a really good person.`
` She didn't care about anyone's age or gender, and was optimistic and outgoing.`
` I was never bored when I was with her.`
`...And talking of not getting bored, rambunctious Satoko was a good person for that, too.`
` She was pretty bratty, but that was just the way she interacted with others.`
`...Rika-chan was the same way.`
` She didn't speak often, but that didn't mean she was always silent.`
` ...They're my friends!`
`...But... after hearing of the better untold secrets of Hinamizawa from Ooishi-san and Tomitake-san... when I was told about Oyashiro-sama's curse... things started going crazy.`
`Then hearing from Ooishi-san... that Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika-chan were all suspicious.`
`...After that... everyone changed.`
`...That's right.`
`It all started getting weird after Ooishi-san told me all that strange stuff...`
`...At that time, I really should have... should have just not listened to those weird stories.`
`...I shouldn't even have asked Tomitake-san about the past incidents on the night of the Watanagashi...`
`...If I just hadn't gotten that strange sense of curiosity... if I just hadn't...`
`That's right...`
` So that's why they ****ed Tomitake-san.`
` That impudent outsider speaking to the likes of me after everybody went out of their way to keep it a secret from me.`
`They'll probably **** Ooishi-san as well.`
` For trying to unearth what everybody was warning me was better left buried.`
` Besides that... he was unforgivable for spewing words that made me doubt the others. `
`...Of course a guy like that is going to be ****ed...!!!`
`Both Tomitake-san and Ooishi-san were nothing but outsiders, after all.`
` They were entities who couldn't coexist with the people of Hinamizawa.`
` Those guys should just fall to Oyashiro-sama's curse and just ***!!`
`It wasn't their fault.`
`...It was my fault for not being able to hold back my curiosity.`
`It wasn't their fault.`
`It wasn't their fault...`
`Itwasn'ttheirfaultitwasn'ttheirfaultitwasn'ttheirfault.`
`I settled into a daze... it was a lethargic feeling like I had just gotten up, but the ominous chill that haunted me had subsided.`
` ...I was fine now.`
` ...I was no longer frightened.`
` ...I had completely recovered.`
`I'll go to school tomorrow, right as rain.`
` I'll greet everyone.`
` I'll take part in club activities.`
` It'll definitely be fun.`
` It had to be fun.`
`...I was one of them, after all.`
`"...Ah, that reminds me. I need to eat those mochi...`
` I hope I'm able to tell which one Rena made."`
`I remembered the homework the two brought with them when they visited me.`
`But wow, our club did delivery. That was something else.`
`I picked up the package I'd dropped on the floor and headed into the living room.`
`It would be nice, I guess, to have some tea with it.`
`...To fill my mouth with mochi while drinking tea.`
` ...Oh.`
` This was quite a delectable situation I was in.`
`Opening up the newspaper wrapping, there were five plump red bean paste mochi fit snugly inside.`
`There were letters written from left to right on the newspaper: A, B, C, D, and E.`
`Now, then...`
` They said Rena made one of these... I wonder which one.`
`There wasn't much difference in how they looked.`
`They smelled and appeared about the same.`
` ...This was... a pretty difficult problem!`
`The biggest difference... was probably their shape.`
`I wasn't sure what kind of person Mion's grandma was, but Rena's had to be different from hers...!`
`Looking carefully, I could see one mochi that was made very neatly.`
`So well that, just by staring at it, one could tell it stood out.`
`"...Looks like this challenge depends on whether or not this one is Rena's."`
`Calm down and think even harder...!`
`...Mion had said her grandma made a ton of them and was told to give some out, if I remembered correctly.`
`...So that meant four of these were from that large batch.`
`Then what about Rena?`
`She probably... only made one.`
`So she probably spent quite a bit of time on it.`
`...Meaning... the one Rena had made was this one... E!!`
`For a moment I thought it may have been a trap Mion laid as she knew I'd pick up on it, but that probably wasn't the case.`
`...I wouldn't be so sure if I knew Mion had made it, but since she said Rena made it, it probably wasn't a trap.`
`"All right.`
` My tea is ready, too.`
` I'll start with the defending champ, Mion's grandma.`
` ...Let's see."`
`Hmm.`
` ...Not bad.`
`The smooth bean paste and soft, chewy texture left little to be desired!`
`The tea I drank afterwards also accentuated the experience.`
` ...This... was an exquisite piece of work!`
`Now, how about Rena's?`
`The creation was so delicate, one would think it was a high-class Japanese dessert.`
`Since I normally had quite the appetite, I was slightly worried about the size of the portion...`
` But, well... first, a bite...`
`...This was quite a difficult one to judge, actually!`
`The ingredients were exactly the same so there was little difference in flavor.`
`What was different was how it was shaped at the end, so it was to be expected.`
`So the deciding factors would be... presentation and volume.`
`The well-formed and well-sized champion, versus Rena the challenger, with a size you just couldn't get enough of!`
`I'd only had one bite of Rena's.`
`I would probably have to wait until after I was done eating to make my decision.`
`...Maybe... there was something hidden inside that could cause an upset...!`
`"*chew chew*`
` ...`
` Hmm..."`
`It seems my prediction was right.`
`My tongue touched something.`
`It didn't feel like something edible, so I reached in with my fingers and grabbed it.`
`...What...`
` ...What was this?`
`Before I could fully comprehend what it was, I threw away the rest of the mochi I was eating as fast as I could!`
`It slammed against the wall, causing the bean jam to splatter.`
`Then, after sticking for a moment, it slid down to the floor.`
`...I was dumbstruck by my own actions.`
`What was I doing...!?`
`Rena had gone out of her way to make it for me... How could I!?`
`Dumbstruck, I looked down at the hand that performed such a vile act... then I remembered what I had taken out of my mouth...`
`At first I thought it was a hair.`
`Even though it was shorter than Mion's, Rena's hair was still quite long.`
` And it wasn't this short.`
`It was also a bit too hard to be hair.`
`It was thick enough to roll around on my tongue.`
`...There was a bit of a metallic sheen on one end of it, ah yes, there was a hole for where thread goes through, like it was a sewing needle...`
`Yes, that's right...`
`It looked very much like a sewing needle...`
`...Exactly like one.`
`...The end was pointed as well.`
` Quite sharply.`
`...It really did look just like a sewing needle.`
`Huh?`
`...What did I mean by, "looked very much like a sewing needle," just a bit ago...?`
`...I couldn't answer.`
`But a voice inside me already knew... and let me know by chattering my molars together.`
`...I couldn't stave off the terror welling up inside me...`
`Suddenly, I tasted something metallic and felt a prickling pain at the back of my throat.`
`...I stuck my finger in the back of my mouth and felt around to see if I was bleeding.`
`...Suddenly, I felt the urge to vomit.`
`The sharp taste of bile irritated the back of my throat.`
`I clasped both hands over my mouth and, after writhing in agony... I was somehow able to hold back the nausea.`
`I was finally able to breath normally again, but this time my heart was throbbing intensely.`
`...Then, it finally registered...`
` ...Exactly what was mixed in with the mochi.`
`Before I could think of the correct word, my hands were already on the move.`
`*Splat*`
` *Plop*`
` *Splort*`
`I tossed the rest of the mochi against the wall.`
`The geometrical patterns of the scattered bean jam on the wall suddenly invoked a terrible omen in my mind...`
`After looking away, I dashed out to the hall and flew upstairs to my room, where I stayed under my covers until morning.`
`I clutched my own shoulders, howling madly in a mix of fear, anger, sadness and frustration...`
`This wasn't a threat or warning or reminder, nothing as simple as that...!!!`
`What had happened in Hinamizawa?`
`What is happening in Hinamizawa?`
`What would happen?`
`...I didn't know the answer to any of those questions.`
`Where did I break a taboo!?`
`Regardless... now Rena and Mion... and others...`
` They consider me an enemy!`
`And they thought... I should just die!!!`
`I won't let you kill me!`
` Not for such a... pointless reason!!!`
`I fell into a restless sleep as I was crushed by my negative emotions. It was as if I was being drawn into a billowing, bottomless swamp...`
