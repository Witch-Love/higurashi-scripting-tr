`"Keiichi-kun's been feeling down lately.`
` Maybe he's in a bad mood."`
`"I wonder.`
` Maybe he's on his period."`
`"M-M-Mii-chan, that's gross...!"`
`"Uhyak hyak hyak hyak!!"`
`"...What do you think?"`
`"Don't know."`
`"..."`
`"Could be that Kei-chan...`
` Maybe...?"`
`"...I don't know."`
`"That day, Kei-chan was in that car talking to some tubby middle-aged guy, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` No mistake."`
`"That Ooishi, he probably fed him something fishy..."`
`"He looked serious.`
` Keiichi-kun's face was so pale."`
`"You see...`
` You might not know this...`
` But he's actually the messenger of Oyashiro-sama."`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean?"`
`"Whenever he shows up... someone is demoned away.`
` No lie..."`
`"...Oh?`
` Is that so?"`
`"...The year before last, when Rika-chan's mom drowned, right?`
` Right before that, she was visited by Ooishi."`
`"...Now that you mention it, he was around before Satoshi-kun transferred out, too."`
`"Transferred~?`
` Ahahahahahaha, you're so sweet, Rena."`
`"So this time he's appeared before Keiichi-kun...`
` So Keiichi-kun is going to be demoned away too?"`
`"..."`
`"..."`
`An empty silence hung in the air.`
` And then it was suddenly interrupted...`
`By loud laughter...`
