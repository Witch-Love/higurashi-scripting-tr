`"...Rena's not here.`
` Do you know where she is, Keiichi?"`
`"Huh?`
` She was just there, actually...`
` Hey, Mion.`
` Where did Rena go?"`
`I hadn't heard anything about that!`
`"...Satoko,`
` do you know where Rena went?"`
`"Rena-san, you say?`
` I just passed her in the hallway.`
` Rena-san has class duties today, so she's off to water the flower bed."`
`"Ah~ It was Rena's turn for class duty.`
` Sounds like a drag."`
`...Rena, Rena, Rena.`
`...Upon hearing it repeated, a thought came to mind.`
`It's rude to say this about someone's name... but it was a weird name.`
` It was like some foreigner's name.`
`"What kind of name is Rena, I wonder...`
` What kind of kanji does her name use?"`
`"...Rena is her nickname.`
` She has a proper name as well."`
`"What, really!?`
` I was sure that Rena Ryuugu was her actual name."`
`"Well...`
` I can understand you making that mistake since we only call her Rena-san."`
`She even signs her name as "Rena."`
` It's like it's her real name in school.`
`"I wonder what her real name is...`
` Let's ask her when she comes back!"`
`Satoko and Rika-chan looked at each other.`
`"...You don't need to ask her.`
` We'll tell you what it is."`
`"It's the 'rei' from 'orei' and the 'na' from 'nara.'`
` Her real name is Reina Ryuugu!"`
`"Reina, is it?`
` ...Hmm.`
` So it's read out as Rena instead of Reina?`
` That's a pretty interesting reading."`
`"...No, that's not it. 'Reina' is the correct way."`
`"Rena-san had told us that she wanted us to call her 'Rena.'`
` So we call her Rena-san."`
`"Kei-chan...`
` Rena is Rena, you know?`
` Only strangers call her Reina.`
` You get where this is going?"`
`I understood what Mion was saying.`
`It didn't matter what her real name was, only what names we used between us!`
`Rena Ryuugu is Rena.  She's nobody other than that.`
`"So I was thinking, if I had a nickname, would you call me by that?"`
`"If it's good.`
` So what do you want to be called?"`
`"Con man."`
`Rena then came back into the classroom.`
`One of the juniors near the door told Rena people were looking for her.`
`"What's this now?`
` Who is looking for me, I wonder?`
` I wonder?"`
`Seeing that, both Mion and I sneered.`
`"Bailiff, Ryuugu doth show herself!!"`
`"Con man, you're quite sinister...`
` Hwah hwah hwah!!!"`
`"Wh-What is this, what is this!?`
` Keiichi-kun and Mii-chan are an evil bailiff and...?`
` a con man!?"`
`"Damn you, Renanosuke Ryuugu!`
` Today doth be when thou meetest thy maker.`
` Have at thee~!!"`
`"Wah!`
` Wah!`
` Suke-san, Kaku-san, show them what-for!"`
`"Aye aye, sir!!!"`
`"...I expect my fee to be paid to my Swiss bank account."`
`Since it's come to this, we have no choice! We'll just have a grand battle with five people...!`
`Rena's fierce punches exploded just as soon as she had shown her seal.`
`The evil that was Mion and myself was vanquished in the end...`
`"...I do hope that Rena does go on a journey to make the world a better place.`
` How about heading to parliament first?"`
`"...Spare me.`
` I'll get kyute stuff for you on my travels."`
`The toll of the bell signaled that break time was over.`
`"Come on, come on Keiichi-kun, Mii-chan.`
` The teacher's coming!"`
`I took Rena's hand and stood up.`
`It was just as the teacher had entered the classroom.`
`...Just one more hour.`
` Man, oh man.`
` ...Got to buckle down for one more!`
