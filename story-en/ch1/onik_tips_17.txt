`"...Herm?`
` Those guys just now..."`
`"They had National Diet badges."`
`"Then it's prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki."`
`"That's interesting.`
` The prefectural assembly member and city councilor are related."`
`"It's dirty is what it is.`
` Shouting out each other's name during elections.`
` While one is up for election, the other one holds an assembly, and they double up their campaign activities.`
` Blatantly."`
`"I don't know much about this stuff, but isn't that against the rules of the election?"`
`"As long as they have no prior consultation, there are no restrictions on their political activities.`
` Kuma-chan, the Second Investigation Division is going to be pretty tough for you. `
`You should at least brush up on election laws."`
`"I'm not cut out to handle intellectual crime.`
` 'Cause I'm dumb. Heheheh...!"`
`There was prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki.`
`Also... the Mayor of Hinamizawa.`
`...So, they're all influenced by the Sonozaki family.`
` What crap...`
`"Looks like they were seen off by... the deputy chief and the department chief."`
`It came to me.`
`That night, when the department chief invited me along to get some oden, I thought that was it.`
`"You have a lot of connections, so you might have heard something...`
` have you?"`
`"Nope.`
` Not a thing."`
`"Ma'am, I'll take a tofu fritter and fish cake.`
` ...The councilors stormed in on the police chief in a rage."`
`"Oh, my. Is that so?`
` Ma'am, I'll take another bowl."`
`Prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki were both intimidating.`
`Our snot-nosed career police chief couldn't handle being yelled at by them. They're like yakuza...`
`"A petition with your name came up regarding how the investigation of the Hinamizawa incident is being handled."`
`"Goodness, me?`
` I've not the faintest."`
`"No need to play dumb.`
` You're reopening the past cases regarding Hinamizawa,`
` aren't you?"`
`"I've already got my hands full with Tomitake's death.`
` Nahahaha!"`
`"Really?`
` I hope so for your sake..."`
`There was a period of silence.`
`While we were silent, we made headway on our food and drink.`
`"Whew, that was quite the feast.`
` This month has been a bunch of losses for me, so my wallet was feeling the pinch.`
` Much appreciated."`
`"Nah, it's nothing.`
` Tell me a good horse again.`
` I'll bet on the same one as you."`
`"Nahahahah!`
` I haven't been doing well there lately.`
` I haven't been able to read the horses at all!`
` ...Taxi!!!"`
`I'm going by train.`
`The department chief is taking a taxi.`
`I have my own car, but it'd be rash to drive it home.`
` Can't blow it right before retirement with a DUI.`
`Even though he could still rattle off, it looked like his legs were already jelly.`
`Pushing him into the cab, I gave the driver the department chief's address.`
`"Well, see you again tomorrow.`
` Best wishes...!"`
`"Ooishi-san."`
`"Yeah, yeah."`
`"The past incidents have all been closed.`
` Stop lumping them all together.`
` Those villagers half-believe it's really a curse."`
`"Well, I'm not convinced."`
`"You're going to be retiring next year, aren't you?`
`Weren't you going to pay off your mortgage with your severance pay and move up to Hokkaido with your mom?"`
`"Mother pines to return to her birthplace...`
` It's the least I can do.`
` And the pension, well, it'll let me enjoy myself in Susukino.`
` Nahahahah!!"`
`"The chief said he may have to reconsider issuing your special retirement salary raise."`
`A public servant's severance payment is calculated based on their monthly salary when they retire.`
`So, a special promotion of two pay grades is given before retirement.`
` This tops-up the employees severance payment. That tends to be how it's done around here.`
`Of course, it's not exactly a commendable custom...`
`Incidentally, the difference that two pay grades makes to the payout is quite significant.`
`"I'd expect no less of our egg-head chief, quite the model veiled threat.`
` But... well...`
` Considering how our pay comes from the public's hard-earned taxes,`
` it's the way of the times, I suppose."`
`It certainly wasn't a laughing matter, but I'll laugh through it, anyway.`
`"I don't think it's such a model response.`
` But given how hard you've worked, it's not at all odd for you to take home such a good package.`
` Personally, I'd like you to get it."`
`"If I can get it, well, of course I'd want it.`
` Nahahahah!"`
`"You'll get it.`
` As long you're an adult about this."`
`"Sorry for holding you up here, Driver.`
` Thank you very much."`
`I closed the door roughly, interrupting the department chief's conversation a bit rudely.`
`It looked like he still had something to say, but he just smiled wryly and waved. I waved in return.`
`The cab sped up gradually, and soon disappeared among the sea of lights.`
`"Nahahahah!`
` ...Oh, man...`
` I wonder if I'll be able to repay that loan..."`
