` was an axe.`
`But for that axe!?`
`There was no excuse for that!!!`
`An axe... just like that!!??`
`"Then what about that axe!?"`
`...Then as both of her hands met above her head... the axe that she held came into focus.`
`Rena stayed like that, with that axe raised above her head, and solemnly opened her mouth...`
`Rena took one step forward... still holding the axe high above her head.`
`Thrown about by the unbalanced weight of the axe, she was sent backwards as if she had been carried off by the wind.`
