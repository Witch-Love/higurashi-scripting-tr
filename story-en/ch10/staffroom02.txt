`"Dohaaaaah! Grit your teeth, nyaaaaa!!!!"`
`"Ogghohoooh! Nice punch, Yatazakura-san.`
` Sorry I was late with the scenario! Teehee☆`
` Gbbbaggh!!"`
`"Developing Higurashi always shaves too many years off my life, nyan!`
` I'm sure Higurashi is going to kill me one day, nya!"`
`"Well~ still, I feel like I'm put a good amount of work into it, you know?!`
` But for some reason I always just happen to be on my break when you come over!`
`When I was playing Ring of Red,`
` and when I was playing Silent Hill,`
` and when I was playing Siren,`
` and when I was playing RO, those were all breaks!!`
` Apurogbbgah!!"`
`"That's truly annoying, nya!`
` Now then, still.`
` This upcoming Winterket... will be a hurdle, nya."`
`"Man... I still can't believe it...`
` This is all thanks to everyone who's supported us...`
` But we're going to be right next to W-Nabe Seisakujo!`
` Ahh, we're going to be their buffer zone, aren't we?! `
`Ahh, I bet that's exactly it!!`
` Waaaah, the preparation committee is bullying uuuuuus!"`
`"A few years back they put us on the wall of West Hall......`
` but that left me crying, nya."`
`"Uh-huh, emotionally, it's like what? `
`It's like you know, when you're fighting the boss of Ray Storm's space stage and he fires giant beam cannons from both shoulders, so all you squeeze between the beams and dodge his fire. `
`But then both of the beams get even wider, and it gets even harder to dodge in those narrow confines.`
` To put it in Touhou terms, it's like boss Marisa's lunatic spell? `
`You know, that moment she fires off double Master Sparks!`
` Oh, but there's no gap with that one.`
` That might be the more accurate example, then☆`
` I wish the bullet curtains would've just hit us too!!!"`
`"That's a crazy example, nya.`
` Well, I guess we'll overlook some jokes since this is the staffroom, nya."`
`"Ehehe!`
` Plus this is a hidden staffroom, too!`
` Inside jokes galore!!`
` No catering here!!`
` If you can follow them, then follow on!`
` So with that, it's time for our customary RO discussion----!!! `
`First off, we cannot forget about Tokika-san!`
` That Legend of the Overfiend!!!"`
`"It's pretty amazing, apparently, nya.`
` I'd love to see it at least once."`
`"To be frank, I think there are a lot of people playing RO with two accounts and two PCs.`
` One for standing street vendors, the other for farming and chatting.`
` That's still pretty normal. `
`However! However, you hear?!?!`
` How about two accounts, two PCs, and one PS?!`
` PS being Playstation.`
` What that means is one street vendor, one farming, and also playing a Playstation game at the same time."`
`"Sounds like some tentacle rape protagonist, nya.`
` I don't understand how that's physically possible, nya."`
`"I mean, I seriously couldn't believe my eyes!`
` With his main account he was farming the kobold map as an assassin.`
` So it was okay if he didn't mind it for a few moments. `
`Even when he got surrounded, he evaded everything.`
` Then on his subaccount he ran a shop selling Elunium.`
` And he was totally practiced with it too! `
`Even when he was partying with his guild running a support Priest, he was still running his Elu shop just fine!!`
` I was surprised that no one died, not to mention that no one in the party noticed. `
`But then while he was playing on his main account, he was also playing a strategy game on the Playstation.`
` So while his enemies took their turn or the game was loading, he'd move his assassin around and play RO."`
`"I propose that Tokika-san's a Penomena."`
`"So, how about you, Yatazakura-san?`
` From your messages I take it you're giving your VIT swordsman a break and going blue herb farming right?`
` How many thousands do you have in your inventory again?!`
`I heard you even made a character specialized in farming blue herbs?!"`
`"The magicians are the fastest at farming herbs, nya.`
` One firebolt and ba-ba-ba-bam!`
` I keep track of several places where the blue herbs grow.`
` Once I pick them, I wait out their respawn time and then check again. `
`So I just go around from point to point managing them.`
` That cool, intelligent management of the herbs is perfect for my magician, nya!"`
`"......In all the anthologies I've read, I've never heard of a magician who was born solely to learn firebolt and farm blue herbs...`
` You've proven yourself a man, yeah!!"`
`"Speaking of which, I heard BT-san's playing a Battle Priest lately, nya.`
` A Dancer, Alchemist, and Battle Priest?`
` ...He's sure standing out, nya!!`
` Plus they're all over 80, apparently, nya. `
`BT-san's a hard worker, so they're levelling steadily, nya."`
`"Apparently Ecatarina-san learned Snap after our previous staff room.`
` She said, 'Snap, Throw Spirit Sphere, plenty of Sting's farmed, unya! >d(=w=' She's living the good RO life. `
`She said the only sad thing is that they only win the fortress when she's not there for the GvG.`
` Yeah, yeah, I'm so jealous!"`
`"How are you doing, Ryukishi-san, nya?`
` Shouldn't you be able to job change by now, nya?"`
`"Well... My VIT makes it painful...`
` If it weren't for raids, it'd feel like, 'Sorry I was ever born.'`
` Fire off a little Mammonite, and I'm in the red.`
` Cart Revolution's way too far off... `
`I'm sick of Underwater Cave!!`
` How many times have I died at the horde of hydras packed at the entrance!`
` Give me back my ship fare!`
` I can't take it anymore, Maman! Sniff, sniff, kukekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke!"`
`"...Sounds like you're still living the frustrating failure life, nya.`
` So that concludes our RO staff room, nya!"`
`"Just kidding! Even though we're sharing some funny, interesting stories, we're actually in the middle of hell, still☆`
` Ahhah, there are still not enough sprites!"`
`"If you have time to write this useless text, then go draw the artwork, nya!!!"`
`"Roger! I'll draw it right away!!!`
` Oh, but this time there's nothing but sprites for men!!`
` Like Keiichi, Kasai, and Satoshi?!`
` Hey, hey, can we just make them silhouettes like wind devils?!`
` Gobryofgh!!"`
`"We're truly grateful that you've enjoyed this recent release of Higurashi When They Cry, Meakashi-hen, nya."`
`"Thanks to you, the story of Higurashi When They Cry is finally entering the latter 'Answer' arcs.`
` Our next chapter, 'Tsumihoroboshi-hen', is planned for release at Summerket 2005."`
`"We're going to be working even harder, nya.`
` So please, we hope you continue to give us advice and encouragement, nya."`
`"I'll be working hard to make the scenario even more enjoyable for you.`
` I'm sorry there were so many typos.`
` But why is Hisui-san so moe when she makes the same typos?!`
` I'm sorry for most of the typos.`
` ...Moe!! `
`Ryukishi-tan, hahh, hahh!`
` Gryppagh!!"`
`"We hope you'll continue supporting us in the future as well. ...Bow."`
