`"Okay, it's been a while since we had an after party,`
` but let's go~~!!!"`
`"""Good work!!!"""`
`"It has been an awfully long time since we had an after party.`
` We used to have one at the end of every story."`
`"I never thought we'd still be having them in the Reiwa era."`
`"After Showa comes Heisei, and Reiwa comes after that...`
` It's hard to keep track of them all."`
`"I want you to try counting out how old we all are in the current Reiwa year when we're from the 58th year of the Showa era.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"No, no, no! Stop it! Stop the count!`
` We'll always be in the prime of our youth!"`
`"Uhh, I suppose there might be some people who don't know what this after party thing is about,`
` so I'll go ahead and explain!"`
`"Back when 'Higurashi When They Cry' was published as a doujin game, it was released chapter by chapter."`
`"Basically every chapter except for Matsuribayashi ended in tragedy and left you feeling bad..."`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` So to clear those bad feelings away, we held these after parties where we all carried on like normal!"`
`"Things were brutal for us in the stories too, so we wanted to cut loose here.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"Apparently it's both our own after party and an after party for the production staff."`
`"That's right!`
` It's also meant to celebrate the final build, so it's shenanigans all around!"`
`"...In actuality, the debug tournament from hell starts right after this, so it's not really the final build at all.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"I see...`
` So that excitement and those agonizing cries come from the fact that they're making this right after their brains are completely fried from trying to finish said final build."`
`"Apparently, they even got letters complaining that the awful excitement completely ruined the solemn feelings they had when the chapter ended."`
`"Well, that was a trope of doujin game development at the time, so cut them some slack."`
`"Um, for those who don't know, a doujin work is a thing someone creates independently and then sells by themselves at event spaces."`
`"There's other opinions about what counts as 'doujin', as well."`
`"Anyway, since doujin works are typically developed during the creator's spare time, there are no real deadlines..."`
`"But since the days the events are held on are set well ahead of time, that ultimately creates deadlines for them anyway!"`
`"So everyone ends up working until the deadline is right upon them, and then after an agonizing all-nighter that looks like something straight out of hell, they send it off for printing at the height of their exhaustion!"`
`"That's why everyone's always burnt out by the time they finish the script.`
` And these 'afterwords' are usually written when they're in that state."`
`"Which is why it feels like everyone was always writing things like, 'Good work,' 'I'm tired,' or 'it was hell again.'"`
`"The afterwords from that era had an air of showing off,`
` like they were bragging about how they didn't get any sleep."`
`"What a terrible culture, nipah~☆"`
`"They could have just honestly written about that, so why did they instead turn into those crazy after parties that were all over the place?"`
`"Well, if the production staff coded in pictures of themselves and said, 'Man, we're beat☆' then it wouldn't be very cute, would it?`
` So, please stop uploading this stuff to pirate sites, everyone!"`
`"Regardless, the atmosphere around doujin game development back then thought of shaving years off your life as being praiseworthy."`
`"Well, you're only able to shave years off when you're still young."`
`"That's true.`
` I guess our old man has truly become an old woman?"`
`"Ahhn?!`
` Want to take it outside, you Numbskull of the Valley of the Wind?!"`
`"What was that, My Neighbor Dodobrain?"`
`"You're The Cicada of Arrietty!!!"`
`"You should do something about your Ponyo belly before talking badly about others, Sis."`
`"You're the one who needs to go on a diet, you Porco R*sso!!!"`
`"You can't say that one!`
` You can't say that one!!!"`
`"And arguments like that used to get even crazier and worse in the after parties of the old days."`
`"It actually feels nostalgic.`
` Seeing that craziness again, I mean!"`
`"...Though they calmed down an awful lot in the titles after Higurashi, didn't they?"`
`"That's because the tea parties that served as the after parties in those games got incorporated into the main story.`
` That's what did away with that wild energy."`
`"There were no more after parties in the games that followed, huh?"`
`"Having that much energy left after going through hell was because of their youth."`
`"By the time Umineko ended and the staff moved on to Higanbana and Rose Guns, they were all worn out and withered."`
`"I guess youth truly is a limited asset...`
` I always thought people could stay young forever. Depending on their mindset, of course."`
`"Believing that youth will last forever is probably another privilege of the young."`
`"Hmm...`
` This has gotten kinda dour..."`
`"Ahh—!!!`
` This isn't what after parties are all about!!!`
` Let's get our blood pumping!"`
`"Yes, pay attention!`
` Kei-chan just said something really smart!"`
`"We can be as dour as we want later!`
` So let's enjoy this moment even more!"`
`"That's right!`
` People who can't enjoy the present will never be able to enjoy the future that comes after."`
`"Alright! Then let's get this after party going!!!"`
`"Today I've brought a magic box from the ritual storehouse."`
`"There's a round hole in the top.`
` ...It looks like your average raffle box."`
`"Inside are pieces of paper with all kinds of topics on them."`
`"I get it!`
` So we'll draw one of those slips and then discuss that topic!"`
`"I'll go ahead and draw the first one then.`
` Here we go!"`
`"Uhh, what's it say?`
` 'What kind of person would you want to marry?'`
` Hauu~ It's embarrassing right from the start!!!"`
`"Then let's have Kei-chan be a man and go first!`
` No stereotypical answers, either!`
` You have to say what you genuinely feel!"`
`"W-What do you mean, no stereotypical answers?!`
` Huh?`
` Why are you pinning my arms behind me?!"`
`"Nipah~☆`
` Here's a treasured injection from the Furude Shrine to make you answer honestly☆"`
`"S-Stop, stop, stop!`
` Ugyaaaaaah...!!!"`
`"Rika... is that syringe...`
` really safe to use on somebody...?"`
`"Of course. The effects are immediate.`
` See, Keiichi's look has already changed."`
`"K-Keiichi-kun... Are you okay?`
` You don't feel ill, right...?"`
`"Hey~ Can you hear us...?`
` What kind of person would you want to marry?"`
`"Fh, fh, fhooooooh!!!"`
`"First, let's start by defining marriage. Are two people married after submitting their marriage registration? If so, then marriage is reduced to an administrative term used by cold-blooded officials! Is that acceptable? `
`No, it is not!!! Marriage should be defined as when two souls are drawn to each other and vow to spend their lives together! Love is everything! Without love, there can be no marriage!!! Yet are the gates of marriage open to any two people who love each other?! `
`No, it is not open to all!!! If love is everything, then age, nationality, religion, and even gender should mean nothing in the end!`
`Since Japan does not allow that, then I can firmly declare that the Japanese definition of marriage is not the same marriage I believe in!!! No, in fact, even asking both parties to be human is foolish! Humans and animals, or even humans and inorganic creatures should be able to marry! `
`If both parties love each other and they're certain of that, then the bond between those two is already eternal!!! How is that not marriage?! How is it not?! `
`Now, to return to the question at hand!!! 'What kind of person would I, Keiichi Maebara, want to marry?' The very question itself is flawed! It's mistaken! Oh my god!!!`
`You're already being too narrow-minded by limiting it to people! You don't get it!!! At this point, Keiichi Maebara has already married over a hundred wives!!! Of course, they are not people, nor are they animals!!! The one that I first married was a silicone bgyaah?!"`
`"Hmm, I don't really get it, but I think I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that!"`
`"...By silicone, does he mean... a doll?`
` Was Keiichi-san referring to the doll that served as the mother when he played house as a little boy?`
` Keiichi-san is surprisingly pure!"`
`"Meep~ Nipah~☆`
` I hope you stay this way forever, Satoko☆"`
`"By the way, what kind of person would you want to marry, Sis?"`
`"M-Me?!`
` W-Well of course, I'd like someone who's mastered every martial art, has a thorough understanding of cryptography, works for an international spy agency, and umm, uhh...!"`
`"I... would just want someone who went through school together with me, and was always friends with me.`
` Someone who would just turn to me at some point one day and ask, 'Do you want to live together?' I think."`
`"W-What is that?!`
` Rena, that's so plain!`
` I-I think you should be dreaming a bit bigger, wahaha!"`
`"Hahh, honestly, it's hardly worth trying to support you, Sis."`
`"Ahh, uhh, uhh!`
` Well then, let's draw the next topic!`
` I'll do it!`
` Here we go!"`
`"Uhh, it says, 'This year is Higurashi's 20th Anniversary'?"`
`"Eeh?!`
` That's incredible! We've been around for 20 years by now?!"`
`"Wow, it's already been that long?`
` We've only been able to make it this far thanks to everyone's support!"`
`"Every now and then I get anxious about what everyone from the Heisei and Reiwa eras thinks about the Showa vibe we have..."`
`"For one thing, 20 years ago the original author wrote Higurashi thinking it would only get read by people attending Comiket."`
`"Culture will change over twenty years.`
` What would pass for a joke twenty years ago is unforgivable now, and the opposite is also true."`
`"This game is a work of fiction that was written in the 14th year of the Heisei era.`
` I hope those who install this game understand that it was written in a time with a different culture and different values. `
`We also cannot guarantee that owning and playing this game will always remain legal in the future Japan.`
` ...Though it's a bit crude that we have to make things like that clear at the very beginning now."`
`"It may be crude, but that's kind of era we're heading into.`
` Now anything and everything is permanently recorded in the digital realm. `
`And without adding a disclaimer like that, it can be misinterpreted as a reflection of the author's current values."`
`"It's also been twenty years for the author since writing Higurashi.`
` I'm sure his thoughts and ideas have changed between then and now."`
`"The author even said that he was able to write Higurashi precisely because it was twenty years ago, when he was young. `
`He mentioned that if he tried to write it now, at his current age, then even if the setting was the same, it would end up turning into a completely different story."`
`"After aging twenty whole years... well, a lot would change."`
`"All the staff members who endured that agonizing development hell would be twenty years older now too..."`
`"There's no way they could all just sleep in the same room until it was finished, now. `
`Each of them has children, and they have families to spend time with. Not to mention the huge difference in their stamina and concentration between then and now."`
`"That said,`
` it's still possible for them to challenge themselves with writing stories that they can only write now after living through the past twenty years, right?"`
`"That's very true!`
` Though I think it's also incredible that they're still holding onto the energetic feeling that Higurashi had twenty years ago."`
`"That's something we can't be grateful enough for.`
` We were only able to reach this 20th anniversary thanks to everyone's support."`
`"So, thank you very much, everyone!`
` You have no idea how much it means, or how encouraging it is that you all continue to support us and that people are still enjoying Higurashi even to this day."`
`"Our Hinamizawa may forever be trapped in the 58th year of the Showa era, but we'll stay in good spirits and keep going wild forever!!!"`
`"We'll always be full of energy, growing paranoid, reaching Level 5,`
` and running wild☆"`
`"It would be lovely if we're able to do something special for the 20th anniversary, wouldn't it?"`
`"Heh, heh, heh.`
` I have a few ideas of my own."`
`"Well, we don't know if any of them will come to fruition, but it would be lovely if we are able to do something!"`
`"Then I guess the next one is the last one?"`
`"Alright!`
` I'll pick the last one!!!`
` Here we go!!!"`
`"Uhh, uhh?`
` ...The anime, Higurashi Gou & Sotsu!`
` That's our topic!"`
`"Yes, yes, yes!!!`
` Let me talk about this first!"`
`"As Hinamizawa's conscience, I never once developed Level 5 symptoms!`
` I was the angel who never doubted her friends!`
` I think most of the fans who cheered for me, decided to support me because of that."`
`"Shii-chan's Hinamizawa Syndrome was quite different this time, and it brought out a different kind of fear and sadness..."`
`"I can't believe you stomped my head in that badly and shoved me into the outhouse."`
`"I know, right?!`
` That was so gross, wasn't it?!`
` The angelic Mion-chan would never be able to do such a thing!`
` What were you going to do if you made all my fans throughout the nation disgusted with me?!"`
`"That's not what really makes you appealing, anyway. I think your true fans enjoy watching you go wild."`
`"What's that supposed to mean?!`
` Then go ahead and list ten things that are appealing about me!!!"`
`"Ten?`
` Heh, piece of cake!!!"`
`"Huh...?"`
`"First off, the index finger of your right hand is cute, you know?`
` Next, the middle finger of your right hand is cute, you know?`
` Next..."`
`"Kei-chan, you jeeeeeerk!!!"`
`"You had it very good for yourself, Mion-san.`
` The things people said about me were awful..."`
`"That's not true~`
` Your Nee-nee understands you!`
` It was all Rika-chama's fault!`
` In this world, there are just some people who hate studying, no matter how hard you try and make them do it!"`
`"Meep.`
` For me, the anime was just tragedy after tragedy after tragedy..."`
`"It was still full of surprising and unexpected scenes though, so it was a lot of fun!"`
`"Yeah. According to the author, the anime was full of surprises, even for him, so he was able to enjoy it like a normal viewer."`
`"What started as a text-only outline became a series composition outline, then a script, and then storyboards, and then finally images were animated. `
`Though people imagine scenes differently if it's just text, right?`
` So because of that, there were several scenes that shocked even the author."`
`"Sometimes it's best to leave it to the experts.`
` Besides, things that are fun to read as text and things that are fun to watch as anime are slightly different, too."`
`"There are some moments when my successive traps can cause an unexpected combo that would shock even myself, despite being the one who set them."`
`"One good example is the scene where Mion pounds away at me and stuffs me in the outhouse. The only thing written in the outline was, 'She gets dumped in the septic tank.'"`
`"The septic tank is beneath the outhouse, so it wasn't wrong, at least?"`
`"Apparently the author had envisioned her removing the lid of the septic tank and dropping her in with a splash."`
`"Ahh, but then that became dumping her through the opening of the toilet, and since that opening isn't very large, she wouldn't just slip inside, so..."`
`"That's how it became that famous scene where Rika-chan, who always acts in the shadows and steals the good parts with a smile and a Meep~ or a Nipah~☆,`
` gets bashed over and over again!"`
`"Huh?"`
`"F-Famous scene or not aside, the author was taken aback, but he wanted to make use of the surprising sense of intensity, so it got the all clear."`
`"I see.`
` So even the author watched with surprise at the unexpected interpretation of his work."`
`"I always thought the authors knew everything about the production process, and could tell which scene was which with their eyes closed by the time it ended up on TV."`
`"There was some of that as well,`
` but I think it's really fun that even the author could be shocked."`
`"That's true.`
` It wouldn't really be Higurashi if it couldn't shock the author himself!"`
`"By the way, it ended with me as an incredible villain in that tale...`
` ...so how I am supposed to face the rest of Hinamizawa now?"`
`"Meep~`
` I don't think you need to pay it any mind. `
`When I ask you to buy toilet paper but you come home without buying any, I play out eight or nine ways to brutally murder you in my mind while I'm wiping my butt with printed straw paper. `
`And then when I finally come out and you tell me, 'Rika, you take too long in the bathroom,' I feel like I could easily waste a hundred or two fragments on just bullying you, nipah~☆"`
`"Same.`
` My sis's incomprehensible nitpicking and insensitivity`
` leave me so frustrated that I murder her a hundred or two times in my mind every day!"`
`"Everyone has things that irritate them, or that they can't tolerate.`
` And we often vent like that by imagining how we'll get back at them."`
`"I don't think that's an unhealthy response, but..."`
`"Well, I'm not really one to talk either...`
` But being part of Hinamizawa is learning what's important. Learning to grow up."`
`"Besides.`
` All of Gou and Sotsu are Satoko's story.`
` Whatever she does there, or learns from then on, that's all up to her."`
`"Rika-chan just mentioned she'd waste a hundred or two fragments in her imagination just bullying Satoko, right?`
` But everyone can laugh it off, because it's all just inside Rika-chan's head. `
`The story of Gou and Sotsu is nothing more than something Satoko imagined, if you ask me."`
`"...If you animated what's inside my head it would be quite impossible to broadcast on air☆"`
`"That's right, that's right!`
` My imagination is incredible too!!! `
`When I suffer an awful fate from your punishment games, my mind goes into making Mion and Shion change into Angel Mort outfits in front of me before I make them ******, and I have Rena *****!!! `
`Then I have Rika-chan and Satoko *****!!!`
` They can cry all they like, they'll all ********!!!"`
`"Er, huh?!`
` Were we not just saying it's okay to do whatever you want in your imagination?!"`
`"You just made me question your humanity..."`
`"Kei-chan...`
` I think you should enjoy that by yourself in your head instead of voicing it out loud."`
`"If we had crime prevention buzzers in our era, they'd all be beeping and buzzing right now.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"It's true that Satoko caused countless tragedies in lots of fragments.`
` ...Each of those was an unforgivable sin, I think.`
` But I would still forgive her. `
`Because the fragment that she chose in the end was a world where everyone is happy and both her and Rika-chan respected each other's choices."`
`"That's true.`
` I agree with Mii-chan.`
` What matters is what we choose in the end.`
` All the other hypotheticals leading up to that.... those are just dreams."`
`"......That's the same thing Hanyuu said to me when returning to our original fragment during Saikoroshi."`
`"It might be a dream, or it might have actually taken place.`
` But we're unable to make that distinction, so what matters is the world that we're all living in now."`
`"...I...`
` I still think I was a bit of a victim, being pulled around at Rika's whims."`
`"But... as time passes and I continue to live in Hinamizawa without Rika... then maybe my thoughts will come to change."`
`"You know,`
` I also think I went through awful experiences because of you."`
`"But... as I live at St. Lucia's without you, then maybe my thoughts will come to change as well."`
`"It's up to everyone how they choose to interpret the story."`
`"That's right.`
` We can't force anything on anyone.`
` But when you do regain your spirit,`
` I'll always be waiting here, ready to accept you. `
`...Always being there for people like that is what being a friend, no, a best friend is about."`
`"...This has somehow gotten complicated."`
`"Satoko and I should have just punched each other and then talked it out from the start..."`
`"...Who knows...`
` ...Though I'm sure all the twists and turns we took... where I vented everything festering in my heart, is what allowed me to be able to say how I really felt..."`
`"I'm sure the fact that you two are practically close family... actually made it harder to talk about.`
` So in that sense, no matter how many tragic fragments it took, `
`I don't think a single one was wasted in helping your mind mature."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I think I will take my time to think on it."`
`"No matter what happens,`
` I'll always be your best friend, Satoko."`
`"......"`
`"Hey, Satoko!`
` What's the matter? You're looking down!"`
`"Everyone's all gathered together over here!`
` Today, we're having a sukiyaki party at Angel Mort!!!"`
`"Then that's it for our club-member-only after party. It's time we joined up with everyone else."`
`"Satoshi-kun!`
` Look at you! You made it to Angel Mort all by yourself!!!"`
`"...Mmph.`
` Shion, how old do you think I am?"`
`"You can have a seat, Nii-nii!`
` I'll get plenty of meat for you, so eat up and be happy!"`
`"Spoiling Satoshi-kun is my job.`
` Shall I chew the meat up for you?`
` I'll bite it up and make it nice and soft~♪"`
`"We should go too.`
` Let's all eat up and keep working hard!"`
`"Yeah! That's right!!!`
` We club members are going to tear up the Reiwa era too!!!"`
`"...Fight on~☆`
` okay?"`
`"Rika.`
` Your world will stay the same.`
` Forever and ever more."`
`"...True.`
` It will keep on going, just like we wished, and we'll continue to change and grow, just as we wished for."`
`"I won't be satisfied with just twenty years. I'm a hundred year old witch, and I plan on keeping it up for another century."`
`"That's the spirit.`
` Now, it's time for you to go too.`
` Go eat lots and lots, okay?"`
`"We've all made it this far thanks to all of you.`
` From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you very much.`
` And we hope that you'll all continue to support us, as well♪"`
