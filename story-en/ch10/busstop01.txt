`The scene is set deep within the mountains of a certain region,`
` where there is a bus stop on the outskirts of a village - the "Hinamizawa Bus Stop".`
`It is a lonely place devoid of people, with hardly any private homes nearby.`
`Rain is pouring outside, and a gloomy mood hangs over the area.`
`That bus stop is a stand made from crude wood that only just barely keeps out of the rain.`
` Inside, there is a bench only wide enough for three people, and two town bulletin boards.`
`The bulletin boards hold posters, including one concerning a national census and one about donations to the village festival. `
`The poster that stands out the most, however, is the one reading, "Oppose the Hinamizawa Dam Project" made by the residents protesting it.`
`Two young students (Mion and Rika) approach the empty Hinamizawa Bus Stop with only the sound of rain to be heard.`
` I'd love nothing more than to die laughing!`
` Ahhhahaha!`
` ...Ghoh, ghoh, ghoh!"`
` All my plans, bam, canceled!`
` Forget about school too!"`
` Well, when that day came, I just had to skip!`
` You know?!"`
` Just kidding!`
` But before we know it, maybe our emotions will take us one step up from friendship!!"`
`Mion draws close to her with an ominous grin.`
` Rika inches back on the bench, trying to get away from her.`
`As Mion prepares to launch herself on Rika, two men (Tonegawa and Arakawa) appear.`
`Mion hastily moves away from Rika.`
` ...When I get my chance, I'll bury the two of 'em.`
` ...Rika-san, we'll continue afterward."`
`Mion glares at both men with a suspicious, burning look.`
` Both Tonegawa and Arakawa feel forced to take a step backward.`
`Rika buries her fist into Mion's stomach without a moment's pause.`
` Mion curls up and falls silent after that.`
`Rika wraps her arm around Mion's neck and strangles her in her armpit.`
`Rika immediately slams her fist into Mion's stomach again.`
` This time, Mion hits the ground.`
` ...Is this one of those,`
` 'It's elementary, Watson!' sorta things?!"`
`A moment of silence passes.`
` Rika makes no attempt to shake the hands offered to her.`
`Mion remains frozen, looking for a handshake.`
`Exasperated, Rika shakes her hand.`
`Mion is silently overjoyed.`
`Rika turns and glares at Mion.`
` She stomps even closer to Mion, who has just interrupted their serious discussion.`
`Rika rapidly closes in on Mion and the two exit the scene while screaming her usual line.`
` The two from the Ministry of Construction stand there dumbstruck, unable to understand what was happening.`
`Bang!`
` Thud!`
` Several more sounds of blows pass.`
`The two Ministry men look at each other in shock.`
`Afterwards, Rika returns to the scene, smacking her hands clean.`
`Mion returns to the scene clutching her stomach and staggering.`
` In fact, it's absolutely bad." (Said while turning to Mion)`
` Her stomach pain has disappeared, as if she were never hit at all.)`
`Henceforth, the two Ministry men add exaggerated nods every time Mion expresses agreement with the dam.`
` Occasionally Rika glares at them, and they cower while still holding each other.`
`Rika glares sharply at those around her.`
` Both Mion and Arakawa shrivel up on the spot.`
`Tears well in Mion's eyes, full of violent emotion,`
` Rika stands there with little to say,`
` and the two Ministry men anxiously watch over both them.`
`Suddenly, Rika turns on her heel and exits the scene.`
`Rika exits quickly.`
` Mion gets a hold of herself and starts to follow after her,`
` but Arakawa suddenly lets out a groan.`
`Blackout.`
` The sound of heavy rain plays.`
`The scene remains pitch black.`
` A voice plays over the radio.`
`The sound of thunder echoes in the distance.`
` The stage slowly grows lighter.`
` The sound of rain fades into the distance.`
`The two Ministry men are gone.`
` A man (Yoshimura) appears, running on stage.`
` I guess you could say my career is in freelance writing."`
`Tonegawa and Arakawa return from the bathroom.`
` Yoshimura looks disappointed.`
` Arakawa, also from the Urban River Office." (Holding out his hand.)`
` Sonozaki (Furude), also from makes-no-sense-to-me." (Holding their hands out to Yoshimura.)`
`All four look at each other and slowly shake their heads.`
`Blackout.`
` Bam, bam, bam!`
` The sound of pounding rings out.`
` A moment of silence follows.`
`The scene remains pitch black.`
` A voice plays over a radio.`
`Thunder echoes.`
` The stage steadily lights up.`
` The sound of heavy rain fades into the distance.`
` National beauties discovered in Hinamizawa!"`
` (Mion freezes while holding a model's pose, then after a moment of silence, Yoshimura continues speaking, ignoring Mion.)`
`Yoshimura pauses to build tension.`
` Mion remains frozen in her pose.`
` Rika, exasperated, relents and shakes Mion's hand.`
` Mion is once more silently overjoyed.`
`Distant thunder.`
` The sound of rain grows a little stronger.`
` There's silence for a moment.`
`Arakawa bitterly hangs his head.`
` Tonegawa is left confused.`
`Thunder rings in the distance.`
` The rain continues pouring down hard.`
` A moment of silence passes.`
` They say that Oyashiro-sama's standing by their bedsides!"`
` .........Positive."`
`The light goes out and the stage goes dark.`
` ...Even if it did happen right after that conversation! ...It was an accident!"`
`Distant thunder.`
` The sound of rain.`
` A heavy silence.`
`The stage goes dark.`
` The light centers on Arakawa.`
` Arakawa recalls the moment when he was cornered by Mori wielding an awl.`
` They don't exist!`
` Please calm down!"`
` ...They don't exist!`
` Oyashiro-sama!`
` Isn't reaaaaaaal!"`
`Arakawa bitterly leaves the stage.`
` ...The sound of rain resumes.`
`A heavy silence hangs between them.`
` Yoshimura doesn't respond.`
`The sound of rain gradually fades out along with the lights.`
` A moment of silence passes.`
`The stage remains pitch black.`
` A voice plays over a radio.`
`The sound of thunder strikes.`
` The stage gradually grows brighter.`
` The sound of heavy rain fades into the distance.`
`Arakawa still hasn't returned from the bathroom yet.`
` 'Supearninggud hemorrhaging'!"`
`Tonegawa exits.`
` Rika also stands up after a moment.`
`Mion and Yoshimura are left behind.`
` There is silence and the sound of rain.`
`Mion is concerned with her light headache the entire time.`
` It's an elegant hotel in Kasai Rinkai Park."`
`Thunder rings in the distance.`
` The sound of rain continues.`
` A long silence passes between them.`
` Mion is pretending to smile, but her face is pale.`
` Her shoulders are shuddering.`
`Mion steps back, shuddering a little.`
`Yoshimura begins to laugh like crazy.`
` Mion stands there dumbstruck by his bizarre state.`
`Thunder violently roars.`
` The scene goes dark with the sound of a heavy downpour.`
` A moment of silence passes.`
`The stage remains dark.`
` A voice plays over the radio.`
`Thunder booms out again.`
` The stage steadily grows lighter.`
` The sound of pouring rain fades into the distance.`
`All five people are sitting on the bench.`
`Mion refuses with an excessive response.`
` Yoshimura, Tonegawa, and Arakawa are all a bit surprised by her odd reaction.`
`There's a moment of silence accompanied by the sound of rain.`
` Then two detectives (Hoshino and Okano) enter.`
`Yoshimura stands up and looks over the two Ministry men and then Mion and Rika.`
`Mion stands up and looks over the two Ministry men, and then at Yoshimura.`
` Yoshimura eyes the two Ministry men suspiciously.`
` They both wince.`
`Mion and Rika leave the scene with Hoshino.`
`Tonegawa leaves the scene.`
` After a moment, Okano gets a call.`
`Okano exits the stage talking on his phone.`
`Yoshimura watches agape as they leave.`
` Arakawa holds his head like his headache has returned.`
`Arakawa continues writhing in pain.`
` Yoshimura continues speaking like he knows what's going on.`
`A dim, pure red light shines down on the stage.`
` The light centers on Arakawa.`
` .........Positive."`
` ...There's nothing there!"`
`The red light changes into a blue one.`
`The blue light changes back to red once more.`
`The sound of an oncoming train is heard,`
` followed by an unpleasant splat.`
` The light shining on Arakawa goes out, and the stage is once more lit by blue lights.`
` ...They don't exist!`
` ...Oyashiro-sama doesn't exist...!"`
` They're not there!`
` They're not theeere!"`
`Arakawa crawls along the ground, trying to escape to anywhere else.`
` Yet his headache is terrible, and he doesn't get very far.`
`Arakawa's legs give out at center stage, and he just keeps shuddering.`
`The light shines on Arakawa.`
` An expressionless Mion, Rika, Tonegawa, Hoshino, and Okano enter the scene.`
` They slowly surround Arakawa at a distance.`
`All but Yoshimura and Arakawa are laughing loudly.`
` Over and over again with a broomstick!`
` You kept beating her even after she started crying."`
` Arakawa hit me!"`
`All but Yoshimura and Arakawa continue to laugh.`
` Arakawa clenches his umbrella and stands up, still wobbling.`
`Arakawa steps toward Mion and Rika, swinging his umbrella around.`
` They both back off, laughing all the while.`
`Arakawa steps toward Tonegawa, Hoshino, and Okano, swinging his umbrella around.`
` All three back off, laughing as they do.`
`Arakawa remains center stage, swinging his umbrella around in frustration.`
` The other five all laugh even harder.`
`The scene flashes, then goes dark.`
` Thunder rumbles.`
` A moment of silence follows.`
`The stage remains dark.`
` A voice is heard over a radio.`
`Thunder echoes out.`
` The stage steadily grows lighter.`
`Arakawa lies convulsing at center stage, his throat and fingers covered in blood.`
`Yoshimura looks around in a panic, not knowing what to do.`
`Hoshino, Okano, Mion, Rika, and Tonegawa return to the stage.`
`Hoshino looks at Arakawa's wounds.`
`Tonegawa leaves the stage, following Hoshino and Okano as they carry Arakawa.`
`A tense silence passes between them.`
` Then Hoshino comes up.`
`Rika leaves the stage, following Hoshino, but her eyes continue to menace Yoshimura until the very last moment.`
`Thunder rumbles.`
`Yoshimura shudders as he looks downward, his face on the verge of tears.`
`Yoshimura falls to his knees and wails.`
` Mion remains indifferent to it.`
`A sharp pain races through Mion's head.`
`Yoshimura's crying somehow changes into laughter.`
`Yoshimura gently waves his hand, and Mion coughs like something's stuck in her throat.`
` ......Fggh!"`
`Yoshimura waves his hand once more, and Mion coughs like something's stuck in her throat.`
`Yoshimura waves his hand, and intense pain races through Mion's stomach.`
` Mion can't hold back her scream.`
`Mion groans over and over.`
` Eventually she takes up the umbrella Arakawa dropped and stands unsteadily.`
` ...Stop this at once.`
` ...Stop this!`
` Right now!"`
`Mion swings the umbrella at him with a roar.`
` Yoshimura easily dodges it.`
` Spit them all up!`
` Spit out those thousands of filthy, squirming maggots!`
` Go on!`
` Go on!"`
`Rika flies to Mion's side.`
` Yoshimura steps back in shock.`
`Hoshino and Okano both race over a moment later and shove Yoshimura away.`
`Yoshimura grabs at Okano in confusion.`
` However, Okano easily forces him to the ground.`
` Owww!`
` Let go of me!"`
`Okano leaves the stage, holding onto Yoshimura.`
` Hoshino glances at Rika and then leaves as well.`
`A short moment later, Mion begins to sob.`
`Mion sobs into Rika's chest.`
` The stage steadily goes dark.`
` A moment of silence passes.`
`The stage remains dark.`
` A voice plays over the radio.`
`Thunder roars.`
` The stage steadily grows brighter.`
` The sound of heavy rainfall fades into the distance.`
`Only Mion and Rika remain.`
` All is silent save for the rain.`
`The sound of rain continues.`
` Mion finally calms down enough to separate herself from Rika.`
`Rika stares into Mion's eyes with a stern look.`
`Tears start streaming from Rika's eyes.`
` Mion becomes shocked and confused.`
`Rika pulls a small bottle of pills from her pocket and hands them to Mion.`
`Hoshino and Okano suddenly appear.`
` Hotoda and Oda appear as well, following behind Nitta.`
`Rika stands in front of Mion, shielding her.`
` Hooray!`
` Idiots.`
` ......There's no way such a sweet deal would come without strings attached."`
`Mion can't understand any of what's going on, and she totters away from Rika toward the center of the stage.`
` Then her head begins to ache once more.`
` ...I'm not in Tokyo... I'm right here.`
` ......nnngh... Lies...!"`
` We understand your attitude on this, Rika-san. So we'll change our attitude as well."`
` ......Gaah... Aaaaagh...! ...!"`
` ......Shut up...! I told you... my head is pounding...!"`
`The moment the men spring forth to capture Mion,`
` Rika grabs hold of Mion and puts a knife she drew from somewhere against Mion's throat.`
`The moment she does, the men simultaneously draw their guns.`
` ...Don't miss."`
`Oda takes careful aim, and then light flashes from his handgun.`
` Rika meets her end with a single shot straight through her chest.`
`Mion nimbly snatches the knife away from Rika and readies herself.`
` The men all aim their guns at her.`
`Mion leaps at Oda and shoves her knife into his stomach.`
` Oda falls and curls up on the spot.`
` ...I'll kill everyone who killed Rika-san!`
` ...Hoooooooooooooooh!"`
` Calm down now!`
` ...Sonozaki-kun!`
` .........!"`
`Mion leaps forward and stabs him.`
`Okano grabs hold of Mion from behind.`
` During their grapple, Mion's knife pierces his neck.`
` Okano falls back, clutching his throat.`
`Hotoda screams and tries to flee.`
` Yet Mion catches her and shoves her blade into her back.`
`Hoshino then falls to the ground, trembling.`
` ...Who was the one that killed Rika-san?!`
` ...Dammit, dammit, dammit!`
` ...I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"`
`She springs onto Hoshino and stabs the knife deep into her stomach.`
`...Corpses are piled up all around her.`
` ...The sound of heavy rain is accompanied by Mion's heaving breathing as her shoulders shudder with each breath.`
`She regains her senses and slowly approaches Rika.`
`A bright red light shines down on the stage.`
` Mion weeps and screams.`
`There's a loud crack of thunder.`
` The stage flashes bright, then goes dark.`
` Only the gentle sound of rain continues.`
` A long silence follows.`
`Steadily the stage grows lit.`
` Only Mion and Rika are present.`
` Mion is sleeping with her head in Rika's lap.`
`Mion clings to Rika.`
` Rika is confused for a moment, then gently hugs her back.`
`Rika hugs Mion with an affectionate expression.`
`Both of them stand there for a moment.`
`Rika starts walking, still holding Mion's shoulder.`
` Mion is nervous and her heart is racing.`
`The stage gradually fades to black.`
`After a moment, there's a beep signaling a radio call.`
