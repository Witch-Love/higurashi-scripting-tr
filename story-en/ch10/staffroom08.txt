`<align=center>To all my friends going through this hell with me.</align>`
`I've been helped by so many people while creating Higurashi,`
` but this is especially for you, those who helped me with this Matsuribayashi chapter...`
`Up until the previous day, Ryukishi07 was enthusiastically writing the script, despite just recovering from a cold that left him bedridden.`
`Every single one of the staff members were in despair over the audacious and serious delays of the script.`
`Though from their perspective, it was the usual state of things before Comiket...`
`The one decisive difference......`
` is that none of our staff could fight through many worlds and an overwhelming span of time in order to achieve our goal.`
`When Yatazakura-san said, "I've already used up all my paid time off, so if the schedule ends up like it did for last Winterket, we're 700% not making it on time, so be prepared for that," it bore far too much weight...`
`......Yeah, there's been one big change.`
`Ryukishi07 said he wants to go to the pool this summer.`
`He wants to float and float around.`
`The pool? When the Master Copy's not even done yet?`
`It was very refreshing to hear one staff member say cooly, "If you don't mind Tokyo Bay, we can float you out anytime."`
`He also said things like, "I want to play games,"`
` "I'm still in the middle of Nobunaga's Ambition,"`
` "Hangames' Mahjong is great,"`
` "Let's have an all-night mahjong tournament this summer break,"`
` "Curse you, Na**-san! Next time I'll crush you with all of 07th!"`
` "I won't cry when I play into a Three Color Terminal Set!"`
` and "Uwaaahn, he's too strong!" There were no end to his dreams of things to do during summer break.`
`...Yes.`
` For the first time... Ryukishi07 made plans for after July, 2006.`
`After all, that would be the first summer break he'd have after four and a half years.`
` No wonder his heart was dancing over it.`
`...But for now, we're 72 hours away from the Master Up deadline at this very moment.`
` It's probably better to hunt down typos than to dream right now. `
`Though joking aside, will we really get a summer break once we hit Master Up?`
` ...We won't just be crushed by the wave of work we've put off because of this hell, right?`
` ...That can't happen, that can't happen. `
`I'm sure it will be a lovely summer break...`
` I'm getting sad talking about this, so let's change the subject.`
`Let's talk about all the other people who fought alongside Ryukishi07.`
`Apparently Yatazakura has sworn to devote himself to gaming once Comiket's over in order to burn through his backlog of games.`
`...Though according to Ryukishi07, the pace he buys games at is clearly faster than the pace he clears them at, `
`so the number of unopened games just keeps growing in his room, and it's doubtful he'll be able to burn through them.`
`Though our esteemed commander (What? lol) Yatazakura would never die under a mountain of untouched games.`
`......I have a feeling he'll find some incredible way to complete the CG sets and clear them one after another.`
`...I just pray it won't be illegal.`
` Also, what kind of illegal program would that be?`
` Install that on my stuff too!!`
`So, he's already coming with his plans for how to play away and enjoy his last summer vacation.`
` Thank you for everything thus far.`
` Play lots and lots and replenish your spirits! `
`After all, the next hell is just around the c`
` (ry`
`BT is being prompted to continue managing our circle's homepage.`
`When we said he'd eventually be our circle's general manager... he hastily declined in a panic.`
`The phrase 'general manager' is truly dodgy.`
` It's just a position that gets all the annoying work pushed onto it.`
` So while we could've let it drop there, Ryukishi07 chanted,`
` "Boss!"`
` "President!"`
` "It's no use anyway, auauau lol ue lol ue!"`
` over and over, so he got angry.`
`...Yet Ryukishi07 didn't understand why he got mad. He's as clueless as ever when it comes to people's feelings.`
`But thanks to you, the homepage he's running is drawing quite a crowd. The homepage he once said would be worth celebrating if it got 80 hits a day has now grown to receive 20,000. `
`We're truly grateful he takes the time out of his busy schedule...`
` Also, he really helped us out by setting up our LAN...`
` I can say with certainty that we wouldn't have made it in time without that... `
`I'm sorry, auau...`
` Also, it was so moe when Yatazakura didn't notice the air conditioner installed in his house so he bought an electric fan, lol`
`dai-san has also been doing better and better.`
`Even though he's only supposed to be helping with the music, when Ryukishi07 pitifully cried,`
` "We're seriously in trouble this time around.`
` We need help!`
` Anyone will do.`
` Please hold me," he answered the call and fell for our huge trap.`
`We kept him confined for so many days that we were terrified his parents back home were going to assume him kidnapped and file a missing persons report.`
`Man, he seriously saved us. Honestly, thank you so much...`
` Kawaguchi also surprised us with a divine save, discovering many bugs for us. `
`Oh, and we heard about this from a certain company's president, but apparently it doesn't count as confinement if they're eating dinner out.`
` So he was on house arrest, not confined.`
` Which makes it legal!!`
`Also, thank you so much for your amazing songs this time...`
`Naruse Tsubaki was also growing more and more full of life.`
`He's able to use a digital camera, and he can use photoshop, and he's a professional chef specializing in Chinese food, so while his shrimp chili was good, so was his deep fried tofu!`
`He also took care of washing the dishes, taking out the trash, and cleaning our rooms.`
` He's able to work as a seller and file our circle application too, as well as hauling boxes, reserving bars, and anything else! `
`If just one of his chromosomes were different, I might have proposed...`
` On top of all that, he can hold his liquor, he's good at mahjong, and he has a success rate with his PangYa Shots lately.`
`The one thing I pity him for is his overly busy work shifts...`
` When he said, "Labor Standards Act?`
` Is that edible?"`
` his words carried far too much weight...`
`The hell I used to spend all alone with Yatazakura-san has suddenly come to see over twice as many people.`
`I really want to thank you all so much.`
`I've said this a few times now too, but this isn't confinement, okay?`
` Uhihihihi?`
`We're still not at Master Up yet while I write this, but once we finish, let's go out for barbeque!`
`Hihihi, I'll treat you all today! Let's go all out!!`
`"Oh, excuse me!`
` Can you take our order?!!`
` Hehehe, now, young lady.`
` Could you add 'first class' in front of everything I'm about to order? `
`There's a world of difference between a roast and a first class roast, after all.`
` Hehehe.`
` Once we have a first class roast, all normal roasts will feel like dog food, gehehe!`
` Now, here's our order!! `
`......First off, one namul, gukbap, and yukhoe for everyone here,`
` then of course a large serving of rice,`
` served along with lots of kimchi and kkakdugi,`
` and a bunch of those vegetables used to wrap up meat.`
`......Also, can we get some soda?"`
`"""Order some meat! Some meeeeat!"""`
`"Call me out on none of those being first class--!!"`
`I salute all my comrades in arms who shared this hell with me...!!`
`Also, I salute the comrades in arms who brought us refreshments and support during this hell!`
`This is why I can never get enough of this.`
`Now to ride off into the sunset towards our next hell--!!`
`Now then, what kind of work should I create next?`
`I'll probably get everyone together at a cafe and brainstorm ideas with each other while enjoying their drink bar again.`
`I'm sure we'll come up with something while drinking that oddly diluted soda again!`
`Now then, let us meet again, my comrades!!`
`For now you should all get some rest.`
`But the hell that awaits us next will be the true hell...!!`
`Huh?`
` The reason we face this hell is all because I'm slow...?`
`I'll do my best to write it up sooner next time~~`
`Thank you for uncovering this secret staff room full of private messages!`
`Now then, everyone, may we meet again~~!!`
