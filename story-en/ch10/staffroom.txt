`"Good work, everyone. I'm Ryukishi07.`
`Well! We've had nothing but long chapters thus far, so it's nice to have short ones once in a while!"`
`"Just confess that it was easier to do the work, nyari.`
`Hello. I'm Yatazakura, and it looks like I won't be getting a paycheck this time."`
`"Well, leaving that aside!`
` With Higurashi having come to a close for now, 07th_Expansion is finally speeding headlong towards its next work!`
` I wonder what we should make next~!`
` That said! `
`Time for an emergency conference on what our next work should be like~!!"`
`"......Meep?`
` Didn't we decide on Umineko: When They Cry?`
`Hello, I am BT.`
` Nipah~☆"`
`"Indeed.`
` I've given it the temporary title of Umineko, and come up with a direction for the story, but is that really what we need? `
`Ryukishi07 will throw all kinds of ideas, one after another, into a pot, in order to make an even more enjoyable work.`
` He'll boil them and stew them together, `
`then leave them overnight, and curry the next day will have to be delicious!"`
`"That's more like yami-nabe than curry, nyari.`
` And sometimes it tastes better when you don't mix anything weird into it, nyari."`
`"Come on—staying on the defensive will get us nowhere!!`
` All interesting stories lead to cooking!`
` Exquisite preparation, a harmony of spices, a secret ingredient beyond imaginings!`
`Elevated to the highest heights, they become a wonderful flavor to move the hearts of men!`
` To do that, we'll research interesting stories from past and present, from east and west, and extract their essences! `
`By bringing them all in, we'll write a spectacular story nobody would have imagined!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` I feel like this will lead us astray, but I think it's an interesting direction."`
`"How naive, nyari...`
` I know how this will end, nyari.`
` We'll think of all sorts of ideas,`
` and then other famous titles will fly out of us, like`
` 'This is just __kihime!', or`
` 'That's F_te!' nyarin."`
`"Hmmmmm, then what about this?!`
` If we keep mixing interesting essences, we'll arrive at a famous title in the end!`
`So instead, we'll do the opposite—throw those famous titles in themselves and mix them up all alchemy-like!!"`
`"I have no idea what you're talking about, nyarin...`
` But in short, you want to rip off a bunch of popular works, mix them up, and maybe come out with something new, nyarin?"`
`"......Curry rice, fruit punch, and strawberry shortcake.`
` Children love each of them on their own, but if you mix them all up, nobody would eat it..."`
`"Are you sure?`
` Are you perfectly certain of that?!`
`Why don't we try? Curry with fruit punch is totally fine with me!`
` Wild alchemy results in numerous chemical discoveries!`
`Even if we get nothing out of it, we might learn something from the process!`
` It is our mission as 07th to shamelessly test it all!`
` It's exciting! It's what we were meant for!`
`There's a water fountain next to you, so I'll wash out your mouth with mud!!"`
`"...If I ate curry mixed with shortcake, I'd want to wash out my mouth too, nyarin.`
` But I figured out what you're trying to say, nyarin."`
`"It's good that you understand!`
` With that, we'll go to a recently popular...`
` No, wait, popularity doesn't matter!`
` We'll all say what titles we're into recently, then throw them in the pot and boil them all up!! `
`All right... First must be you, BT-san!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` It's very difficult for me to pick out one of them, but...`
`I'll go with the safe choice and suggest __zen Maiden."`
`"Oh ho! Safe choice? I think not! You get right to the point, nyarin!`
` A heaping helping of tsundere heroines is just what this age needs right now, nyarin."`
`"No, no, that isn't all.`
` Its originality—having a hikikomori protagonist in a modern world where the problem is only whispered about!`
` Its novelty—having a figure itself, in the age of figure moe, be the heroine! `
`And yet it still has the gold-paved high road Japanese boys can't help but yearn for—a lover appearing without them doing any work.`
` It has the so-called esp__ formula firmly in place!`
`With an essence so perfectly aligned with the times, I can see why that alone would make it a huge hit...`
` Yes, it is suitable for the first ingredient in the melting pot of 07th's next work!!"`
`"......Then next Yatazakura-san should take a turn.`
` ...I have a bad feeling about what he'll say, though☆"`
`"Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!!`
` If you want the high road, you can't leave Ju_p stories out of things, nyari!`
` Fuwoohhhhhh!`
` I have to suggest Sakigake!! _____juku, nyarin!!"`
`"Fu-nuwohhhhhhhhh!!`
` I... I knew it...!!`
` The golden age constructed by J_mp is also the golden age of battles! `
`Any of us Japanese boys can attest to the fact that the catharsis of battle is engraved in our very genes!! `
`All those strong enemies standing in your way every episode, and you, alongside reliable friends, take down one foe after another! `
`Normally, battle stories are weak in that having a single protagonist leads to the battles turning into the same thing every time, `
`but by increasing the number of protagonists, they overcame that problem with variation!`
`The composition of that battle serialization that lasted for such a long time through different cards and situations each battle... `
`I see... You could call it the culmination of the fighting genre that Shu__sha has spent a hundred years constructing!`
` The passionate catharsis in its battles spans time and space! `
`Thanks to the golden work called F_te, it has proven its unchanging attractiveness even in the 21st century!!"`
`"......However, __zen and _____juku already feel like chlorinated cleaner and acidic cleaner."`
`"How nyaive!`
` _____juku's characters might be macho, school uniformed men, and they might be pungent with sweat, `
`but that's merely the outlook of Ju_p comics, and only because Hoku__ no Ken was in its prime at the time, nyarin. `
`In other words, the essence itself is not in the visuals, but in the catharsis of strings of battles and the myriad of combat situations—and that would never be opposed to __zen, nyarin!!"`
`"Hmm, yes, a sharp reading as always from you, Yatazakura-kun!`
` You're correct!`
` In other words, we must elevate the Al__e game that appears in __zen's story as well to _____juku's fighting tournament!!`
`In other words, the school's principal must be a NEET and a shut-in!`
` And then the tsundere heroines appear uninvited!`
` His action-packed days with those girls is only the opening! `
`Eventually, he'll announce the a_s game out of nowhere!!"`
`Zugogogogo!!`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaat? Why would there be a dueling ground there?!"`
`"Now then!`
` Is there anyone who would take on __zen Maiden's second doll, Kana__a!?"`
`"Th-That's where this ___ichigo should come in for real!"`
`"What? No, it's time for this Sui___seki to appear!!"`
`"Out of the way! This opponent is already far beyond your measly tactics!"`
`"Wh-Whaaaaat? Are you ___kuuuuuuu?!?!"`
`"B-But now we have no chance to appear whatsoever..."`
`"Ho.`
` You seem confident in your martial arts.`
` Then why not try this out? The ultimate way to duel,`
` the Arisugeimu!!"`
`"What? The Arisugeimu...?!"`
`"Y-You know what that is, Sou___seki?!"`
`The Arisugeimu, or Al__e Game.`
`Due to constant conflict, Ancient China made it an urgent mission to find everyone skilled in military matters they could.`
`To do that, the emperor at the time used a cruel trial called the Arisugeimu to try and gather every martial artist with unusual talents.`
`Its incredible cruelty was said to only allow one in every hundred to live through the trial and serve.`
`But it honored the warriors who received the right to undergo this trial, `
`and it's said that when the messenger of the Emperor came to villages to request participation in the Arisugeimu, he was welcomed with open arms.`
`Also, this messenger, according to historical legend, wore a rabbit mask,`
` and in England, Lewis Carroll, having gotten the idea from it, later wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, `
`but most people don't know it originated from the Arisugeimu.`
`From Minmei Publishing Company "Gin-sama and the Lactic Acid Bacteria"`
`"If you want to play the violin that much, I'll let you play it for the Enma in hell."`
`"I... I did it! A stunning turnaround victory for __ku!!"`
`"Did you see that, Suigin___~?!`
` Take the hint already and surrender!"`
`"Ku-ku-ku. What fools!`
` I've only been using my low-rank minions. But this is where the Al__e Game truly becomes hell!!`
` Fuhahahahahaha!"`
`"And that's what the story's going to be like!!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` I have no idea whether that's a novel idea or a horrendous one."`
`"It's novel, but nevertheless... I feel like some other circle has already written something like that..."`
`"M-Mmph...`
` Yes, I'm sure another circle has already thought of this...`
`B-But we're not done yet!!`
` We've still only mixed together two things! `
`With a third thing added to the pot, we'll have something horrendously novel!!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` A dryad spirit could probably do it.`
` We'll be looking forward to your help☆"`
`"Last up is Ryukishi-san.`
` What kind of work will you suggest to us, nyarin?"`
`"Heh heh heh heh heh. I'm glad you asked!!`
` This is the big-hitting title Ryukishi07 will propose!!`
` Ku-ku-ku. Yes, a super huge title you couldn't possibly remove from the west hall!!`
`The ultimate king completely dominating Comiket's western hall right now...`
` Not only does it have a fandom and a userbase, but a creative base spread far and deep... `
`So famous that music circles aren't said to be music circles until they make an arrangement CD of it... `
`The title that has filled the entire top 10 list of music CD sales at Torano___ for years with its own genre...`
` Yes!!"`
`"Y-Y-You d-d-don't mean...?!?!"`
`"Yes, the greatest peak of shooting games, the legend among the doujin world, the Tou___ series!!"`
`"...W-Well... You really did pull out the big guns, nyarin...!"`
`"...Meep.`
` But the Tou___ series is a shooting game.`
` We can't make shooting games in our circle."`
`"Of course, we can't extract the essence of the shooting game genre, but we can more than easily extract the essence of its captivating world!`
`Heh-heh-heh. We have the kind of J_mp still encouraging Japanese boys today, _____juku...`
` added to __zen Maiden, which stormed the anime world by hitting every one of this generation's needs! `
`And now we have the doujin world's king of kings, the Tou___ series!`
` Ku-ku-ku, by combining these three incredible essences, we are sure to get results!! `
`It is now our fate to give birth to the ultimate work that will dominate the twenty-first century!!"`
`"I-I understand your logic, nyarin, but what part of the essence do we suck out, nyarin?`
` Like BT-san said before, we can't make shooting games in our circle, nyarin."`
`"......Meep.`
` Does Tou__'s appeal lie outside of the shooting genre?`
` ...Would it be the unprecedented feeling of a mysterious world...?`
` That's another part people love."`
`"Indeed!`
` It is a fantasy world where anything goes.`
` Its unique setting, completely different from an extension of the so-called JRPG-style worlds that already exist, certainly stands out!`
`After all, it has shrine maidens,`
` maids,`
` blazers,`
` gothic lolitas,`
` sweet lolitas,`
` and even Japanese lolitas in it!!`
` Even when they're all in one place, none of it feels unnatural in that world!!`
`Ahh, Z_N, I beg of you, make one of the next new bosses wear a school swimsuit!!`
` And those outfits, normally impossible, are possible in Gensokyo!!`
` In Gensokyo, throwing in other characters is no problem at all!!`
`Ahhhh, please, make the next new boss have a school swimsuit!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` I understand that Ryukishi plays it out of his extremely biased tastes.`
` Now I know why he still hasn't unlocked the extra stages—not with that wicked heart."`
`"To... To sum up what Ryukishi wants to say...`
` It's like this, right, nyarin?`
` We can have all kinds of outfits that suit our tastes all appear in one game,`
` yahoo!!"`
`"Yahoo!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` I would think there are other things we could learn from Tou___, but...`
`For now, Ryukishi is referring to that when he talks about what to extract."`
`"Ku-kukukuku, fuhah-hah-hah-hah!!`
` The gods will bow before us, for when these three elements are combined, the new world that results will bend its knee!!`
` Now, go!! Triple god combination!!"`
`Zugogogogo!!`
`"Wh-Whaaaaaat? Why would there be a dueling ground there?!"`
`"Now come.`
` I am the one, the only Suigin___, the first doll of __zen Maiden!!`
` I shall not complain—I don't care how many of you come at me at once!"`
`"Wh-What do we do? Who will go...?`
` In that dueling ground, we can't use all our skills, can we?"`
`"Ku ku ku, interesting.`
` __ku, you seem confident in your martial arts, but you cannot prevail over me, Suigin___!`
` If we fought like this, it would only end with a boring conclusion. `
`And that won't awaken the fight within me.`
` Therefore, I, Suigin___, will give you one handicap!"`
`"Wh-What's she doing?`
` Suigin___ is drawing a line around her.`
` It's like a sumo ring."`
`".........?!"`
`"Ku-ku-ku!`
` I, Suigin___, will defeat the likes of you without taking a step out of this circle.`
` If you can force me even a step outside it, I will admit defeat, and serve you while wearing a school swimsuit...!!"`
`"Heh...`
` With that condition...`
` I accept.`
` Why don't I do the same thing, then?"`
`"Wh-What?!`
` __ku is drawing a line around herself, too!!"`
`"I'll fight without leaving this circle as well.`
` If I take a step out, I'll admit defeat, and serve you in bloomers and a collar."`
`"Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!`
` __kuuuuuu!!"`
`"Ku ku ku!`
` You're quite presumptuous to think you can take on me, Suigin___!`
` You'll regret that soon enough! Take this!!`
` Rou Zen Mei Den Ultimate Attack!!"`
`"You left the circle.`
` As promised, you'll change into a school swimsuit right now, right here, and serve all of us here."`
`"Wha...`
` But it can't be......`
` Urgh..."`
`"...It's really funny how Suigin___'s voice goes back to normal after she loses, nyari."`
`"Ku ku ku~~!`
` Fun lactic acid bacteria times with Gin-sama in a school swimsuit~ Hau hau~ I'm bringing her home with me~~!!!"`
`"...Should we be leaving our circle's next work to someone like this?`
` I'm very concerned."`
`"It looks like we should remove Ryukishi from the picture before thinking about Umineko, nyarin."`
`"......You heard them, nipah~☆`
`I'll make an actual game, so don't worry about anything."`
`"Keep an eye out for what we're temporarily calling Umineko: When They Cry, nyarin!`
` We look forward to your continued support, nya~!"`
`"We look forward to it, nipah~☆"`
`"...In my view, everything went wrong after Ryukishi mixed all those things together.`
` To correct it a little, we'll have dai-san add something to the mix, nyarin!"`
`"......Meep!`
` If dai-san adds in something normal, I'm sure our strange yaminabe will be a little better."`
`"Then I'll summon dai-san!!`
`dai-san, it's been a long time, nyarin."`
`"Heh-heh. Yes, hello. It's dai.`
` But really, what have you called me here so suddenly for?"`
`"...Meep.`
` We want you to suggest a manga or anime that left an impression on you."`
`"Hmm... I see.`
` ...There are so many to choose from.`
`...But what about Dra__nball?"`
`"Fu fu fu fu!`
` Excellent choice, dai-swaaaan!!`
` Let's go with __zen + _____juku + Tou___ + Dra__nball!`
`There was a battleground there?!`
`Suigin___ put up a brave fight, but for nothing, and now she's being jostled around!`
`And then, the image of a girl with a dauntless smile!`
` What? Are you Bara-Sui____?!?`
`Ku ku ku. You understand, don't you? If you lose, you'll have to play an embarrassing punishment game, geheheheh!!`
` Suigin___, you too! If you lose, it's bloomers,`
` bloomers,`
` bloomers,`
` bloomers,`
` in dark blue,`
` and deep red,`
` with white lines~ haa haa!!"`
`"...U-Umm... Was the bloomer bit at the end supposed to be a reference to Dra__nball...?"`
`"......I had a vague idea, but...`
` It's all vulgar as usual, nipah~☆"`
`"I... I'm starting to worry about our future...`
` Is our circle really going to be all right...?`
` You might want to give us some time to consider whether or not we should stay together from now on..."`
`"...Please continue supporting our circle in the future, and don't abandon us, nyarin!"`
`"Nipah~☆"`
