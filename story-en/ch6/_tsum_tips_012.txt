`I don't remember how many years ago it was.`
`There was this beautiful village surrounded by nature.`
`But the village was going to be submerged in water because of a new dam project, and the villagers protested against it en masse.`
`They held a sightseeing tour so people from other places could enjoy the local beauty.`
`I joined the tour out of simple curiosity. I wanted to take a look at the nature that might sink under the water.`
`But when I got there, the place took my breath away.`
`The air was so clean and clear, and the landscape was beautiful beyond words.`
`Since then, I was hooked on the inspiring nature of the place.`
`...I fell in love with the village so much that I was very glad when I heard that the dam project was canceled.`
`That village is where I'm building our new house.`
`When I visited there, I found a beautiful field of wildflowers.`
`I saw two cute girls playing in that field.`
`Both of them were very beautiful, with long, straight hair.`
`They were probably neighbors or best friends.`
`I still remember how they looked. One of them had a very beautiful face with a clear-cut profile for her age, and the other had a very pretty, innocent look.`
`I'm sure both of them will grow up into fine, beautiful ladies in the future.`
`They were running around in the field like they were dancing.`
`I asked them if the field was their playground.`
`They said they were playing in hopes that newcomers would move to the village.`
`Then I saw a sign saying "lot for sale".`
`That was when I began to think that it might be a great place to live.`
`There was nothing here, and things are a bit inconvenient compared to the life in a city.`
`But... I sincerely believed this was the best place for us to start a new life together as a family.`
`A lot of things happened back in the city... but the past is the past. It's best that we move on.`
`We learn from our mistakes, and I hope we can start a new, more ideal life in this village.`
`Keiichi, I hope you'll grow to love it here as much as I do.`
`......You do?`
`I'm happy to hear that.`
`I'm also happy that we've been doing a lot better as a family since we moved here.`
`Back in the city, we were far from close.`
`...So, I'm truly happy that we're able to start from scratch.`
` Now that I come to think about it, I've never had a chance to have a conversation with you like this before.`
`Oh, Keiichi.`
`Do you know any two beautiful girls with long straight hair in your school?`
`I think they're... a lot younger than you.`
`Oh, you know two young beautiful girls but one has short hair, huh?`
` Hmm... I don't think they're the ones I saw.`
`You want to know why I asked?`
`Oh, I just wanted to ask them to be models for my portraits.`
`I was thinking about making them wear cute costumes... Ahem!`
` B-Basically, I just wanted to see them again, for artistic reasons.`
` So, if you happen to see them, let your dad know, okay?`
` Promise me, okay?!`
`Cough cough!!`
