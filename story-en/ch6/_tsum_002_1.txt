`...I awoke from my dream, still feeling excited.`
`I must've had a very happy dream.`
`I already forgot what it was about... It felt as if there was a switch that automatically made me forget my dreams when I open my eyes.`
`...All I could remember is that it was a happy dream.`
`I look at the ceiling and enjoyed the happy feeling for a while.`
`It was Sunday today.`
`Outside the window, I could hear morning birdsong that sounded totally different from what I heard on weekdays.`
`The morning birdsong on weekdays sounds like they're in a rush, as if they're telling me to hurry to school... but on Sunday, it's different.`
`I could tell that the birds are singing simply because they want to tell everybody how great a morning it is.`
`I even felt like the birds that sing on weekdays must be different birds from the ones that sing on Sunday.`
`I wonder if there really are birds that only sing on Sunday.`
`It sounds like a very luxurious job, for some reason.`
`It's a waste to listen to such a valuable birdsong when you're not quite awake.`
`As I fully awaken, my normal, crude personality takes over, and I start feeling stupid to even think that there might be birds that sing only on Sunday.`
`"...Haww... Ahh..."`
`As I yawned and stretched, my blood started circulating through my entire body. It felt good.`
`I turn over and look at the clock, which says it's past 10 AM.`
`I used to go to my cram school on Sunday at 10 AM.`
`That was before I moved to Hinamizawa.`
`My parents made me go to several cram schools back then. `
`...I remember that the one I had to go to on the first and the third Sundays of the month was the hardest one of all, because I had to change trains several times to get there.`
`I was never allowed to sleep in so late back then.`
`My mom always woke me up early so that I didn't miss my classes.`
`That's probably why I've always dreamed of being able to wake up whenever I wanted on a Sunday.`
`...Needless to say, I don't feel that way anymore now that I moved to Hinamizawa.`
`After all, I can always sleep 'til noon on Sunday now.`
`My life has changed completely since I moved here.`
`Before, I used to think living in the countryside would be really inconvenient. To be honest, I wasn't even interested in living here.`
`But it was only the first few days that I felt that way.`
`Now, I don't feel attached to life in the city or its conveniences.`
`When I think about what part of my life in Hinamizawa I'm the most attached to...`
` I'd have to say`
` it's probably my friends.`
`I guess the reason why I'm being so sentimental is probably because I had so much fun yesterday in the water gun fight with all of my classmates.`
`Despite my age, I got so into it and had so much fun.`
`I bet the kids in the city wouldn't be able to play like that.  `
`No... I should say they wouldn't even want to in the first place.`
`They wouldn't even realize how exciting a simple water gun fight could be.`
`I went downstairs and saw my parents watching a serious TV program, arguing about the topic together.`
`"First of all, telephone service charges in Japan are way too expensive.`
` It's because the state has a monopoly."`
`"But, private companies are profit-oriented organizations.`
` They're not exactly charitable.... I wonder if they can maintain uniform service nationwide."`
`The experts on TV were arguing about the same thing.`
`It seems like there's a possibility the telephone service will get privatized.`
`I'm too young to understand how privatization could make things better.`
`...But I can easily assume that people will start talking about privatizing the postal services in the near future too.`
`My parents were arguing about the topic fiercely, but they got along very well.`
`Let's put it this way: they get along well and that's why they argue.`
`I don't remember seeing them get along this well when we were living in the city.`
`...This is probably one of the things that got better since we moved to Hinamizawa.`
`A cold relationship between parents doesn't bring any benefits to their kids.`
`"Oh, Keiichi.`
` You're up early today.`
` Do you want to eat breakfast?"`
`"No thanks.`
` I'm going out today, so I don't need anything."`
`"Are you going out with your friends?`
` Is it those club activities that you always talk about?"`
`"No, it's not a club activity day.`
` It's the punishment for the game we played yesterday."`
`Someone rang the doorbell.`
`I looked at the clock and noticed it's time to meet Rena.`
`I guess I spent too much time enjoying waking up late!`
`I ran upstairs to get a change of clothes.`
