`"Welcome to Angel Mort.`
` Today we're holding a special event. Do you have a ticket?"`
`"Umm, we don't have a ticket, but we were told to give our names.`
` We're Rena Ryuugu and Keiichi Maebara."`
`"Let me check on our list.`
` Please wait for a moment."`
`Seems like many fans of this restaurant aren't normal people.`
`I bet they'd try to get in with lies or fake tickets.`
`No wonder this waitress makes sure to check the list.`
`"Anyway... those people were just too freaky back there.`
` There's no way that normal people could get through them without a struggle."`
`"Ahahahahaha, you might be right.`
`But nobody can stop me! Hauuuuu☆!"`
`"You sure did them in...`
` Did you use your elbows or knees?`
` You hit them right in the middle of their faces... You're a scary person."`
`The way Rena swept them off their feet with super-fast invisible jabs was incredible...`
`It even gave me a chill just thinking about it.`
`"That's because they tried to sabotage my chance to take my girls home with me☆.`
` They must look so kyute today! I'm taking all of them home with me!!"`
`"...When you're in Kyute Mode, nobody stands a chance.`
` I sure hope they admitted their loss after getting beaten up that badly..."`
`"You did great too, Keiichi-kun.`
` At first, I thought you'd be engulfed by them, but then they became all quiet and let you through with tears in their eyes.`
` What did you do to them, to them?"`
`"...Nothing really...`
` I just told them that I'd get into the restaurant and make sure to see everything they wanted to see. `
`And I told them, 'You might have to shed tears now, but I believe you can get a ticket next time.'`
` That's all I said, but they seemed to understand me..."`
`"...You're so good at that sort of thing.`
` You know, making people listen to you.`
` Yeah, you sure are our club's Magician of Words."`
`"They're all calling me that now.`
` Can't you please come up with a better name?!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` I'll think about it!"`
`Rena laughs loudly.`
`"Thank you so much for waiting.`
` I confirmed your names in the list.`
` I'll take you to your table.`
` Please follow me!"`
`The waitress led us to our seats.`
`The restaurant was completely packed today.`
`It made for a cheerful but sort of crazy atmosphere.`
`All the customers in the restaurant were very unique people, just like the ones loitering around outside.`
`There was an aura of excitement in the store, and it also smelled a bit sweaty.`
`They were also talking excitedly using special terms that I don't understand, again just like the people outside.`
`"Angel Mort is`
` all about the uniform!!"`
`"You taste food with your tongue,`
` but in Angel Mort, you can taste it with your eyes, too!!`
` Where's the waitress with the big`
` heavy`
` pair of melons? I don't see her today!!"`
`"Muohoho!`
` You need to check the shift roster!!`
` If you like girls with big tits,`
` you have to come on Tuesdays and`
` Thursdays`
` after`
` 5 PM!`
` If you like girls with small tits, you have to come on Fridays after 5 PM!!"`
`...I regret coming here today.`
`And at the same time,`
` I was really glad that I didn't lose the game yesterday.`
`This punishment might be a bit easier for the girls.`
`But, as a guy, if I had to undergo this punishment today... I would've been kicked and punched by these crazy customers, because they would've been burning with anger.`
`Let me explain. I didn't come here just to eat lunch with Rena today.`
`The punishment is as follows: the losers have to wear a costume that was randomly chosen and help with the event at Angel Mort... as a waitress.`
`The winners can enjoy eating desserts, receiving service from the losers.`
`When this punishment was announced,`
` I'd actually prepared myself for the punishment because I thought I'd lose the game like always.`
`I was losing a lot recently, so I didn't think I could win.`
`I assume Rena felt the same way.`
`Who could imagine Rena and I would do so well as to win?`
`You're great, Keiichi Maebara.`
` You made me proud!!`
