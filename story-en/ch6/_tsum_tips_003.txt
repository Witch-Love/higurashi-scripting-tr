`Today, I went to a swimming pool with my mom.`
`Uncle Akihito came with us, too.`
`I don't like him because he's sometimes mean to me, but he's a very kind and funny old man.`
`He told me to call him Daddy for that day, because he was going to play with me at the pool like he was my daddy.`
`My mom called him Daddy, so I did, too.`
` Uncle Akihito looked very happy and gave me a lot of money.`
`My mom looked very happy, and it made me happy, too.`
`I want to play with him again.`
` I hope my dad can come with us next time.`
