`"Wooooooo!!!"`
`"Wh-Wh-What is it?!"`
`A guy tumbled in and landed on his feet elegantly... it was Coach!!`
`"How dare you...`
` How dare you, Maebara-san..."`
`Coach glared at me in anger.`
`He was breathing hard with a scary expression on his face.`
`"What do you mean? What did I do...?!!"`
`"That is what I'm talking about!!"`
`Bang!`
` Bang!`
` Bam!`
` Baaaam!!`
`At the moment of his scream, three different metal buckets fell on his head one after another, and a Chinese wok finished the job...!`
`"Well, I was prepared for this the moment my punishment was chosen..."`
`"To see Satoko in a maid costume is like a matter of life and death to you."`
`"Hauuuuuuu!!!`
` I love Satoko-chan's costume!!! It's so, kyute!`
` I'm taking her home with me!!"`
`"I won't let you do that!!`
` I'm going to take her home with me or my name is not Kyousuke Irie!!"`
`"No, no, no, no, no~~~~☆.`
` If you try to sabotage my chance to take her home with me, you get these...`
` Hau!`
` Hau!`
` Hau!`
` Hauuuuu!!"`
`...Once Rena goes into Kyute Mode, she becomes merciless.`
`If a rock tried to sabotage her chance to take her favorites home with her, she'd break it into pieces. If it was a river, she'd fill it up with sand. If it was the sea, she'd split it in half like Moses did and walk through it... `
`What?!`
` Coach got up on his feet like a zombie.`
` ...I couldn't believe he could still get up after getting hit by all of her super-fast attacks!!`
`"Hwahahahahahahahaha!!!`
` That doesn't work on me!!`
`Aw!`
` Ouch!`
` Ouch!!`
`No, that doesn't work, either!!`
` I'll get up no matter how many times I get beaten as long as there's a maid in front of me.`
` Why? Because it's a dream of mankind!`
`Aww!`
` Ugg!`
` Ouch!!"`
`"No matter what, I'm taking her home~~~☆!!`
` Hauuuuuu!!"`
`Irie was down on the floor, his body twitching...`
` Rena just hit him with a barrage at point-blank range...`
`"Anyway... this really is a sight to behold.`
` I'm so glad I won the game, but at the same time, I'm scared to imagine how terrible it would've been if I'd lost."`
`"This is absurd!!`
` While I have to wear this for the punishment, I cannot take it any longer!"`
`"Satoko, your costume is a lot more decent than this ol' man's."`
`"...You think wearing a maid costume is decent? You are completely messed up."`
`"Rena, stop drooling and sit here.`
` It's the winners' right to be served by the losers, remember?"`
`"Hauuuuuuuuu!!!`
` I don't know which one I'm taking home with me today!!`
` Hauu, hauuu!!"`
`"Hey, waitress. What's your recommendation today?"`
`"What about this fruit parfait?"`
`"The cream puffs are very good, too!"`
`"...You can get refills of water as many times as you want for free."`
`Rena's nose was bleeding because she got to keep the waitresses in cute costumes all to herself.`
`...I should actually thank her for acting crazy like that, because it made me look calmer than I really am. I was as excited as her, and my nose would bleed too if I wasn't careful.`
`I now understand what a slack-jawed smile means... Huh huh huh...☆`
`"Hey, Rika-chan, I mean, waitress-san! Can you feed me?"`
`"...Sure..."`
`"Satoko, can you feed me, too?`
` And Mion, you massage my shoulders."`
`"Open your mouth. Aah, I hate this!`
`Hey!`
` I told you to open your mouth!!"`
`"Damn it!`
` Why do I have to massage your shoulders?`
`This ol' man's service is going to cost you!!"`
`Gulp.`
` The audience gasped at the sight.`
`I bet Angel Mort has never had an event as exciting as this one!`
`Every table had four people squeezed in together, but only Rena and myself were at this table,`
` and three waitresses in cute costumes were exclusively serving us!!`
`They were giving us shoulder massages and feeding us desserts, too!!`
` This had never happened before at Angel Mort and it never will again.`
`"...I see.`
` ...They're waitresses...`
` Th-Th-Then, I'd like to have a glass of water!"`
`One of the other customers wanted to get a piece of the wonderful treatment, and patted Mion on the shoulder.`
`"Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm not a waitress.`
` Ask the real waitress over there for a glass of water, okay?"`
`"Wh-Wh-What?!!`
` You're not a waitress?!`
` You can't serve me?!!"`
`"...That's right. We're not waitresses.`
` We have no obligation to provide service to you."`
`"...Satoko, Mii, and I are here for the winners.`
` ...Meep."`
`"It's not fair!!!"`
`All of a sudden, Kameda-kun screamed, starting to blame me.`
`"What do you mean it's not fair?!"`
`"It's not fair that K-san can do such wonderful club activities,`
` and I can't!`
` Not fair.`
` It's not fair.`
` It's just not fair!!!"`
`"H-Hold on... we took a certain risk to earn this right.`
` So, this is fair..."`
`""W-We don't think it's fair, either!!""`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were standing behind Kameda-kun!`
`"First of all, you only won the game yesterday because`
` we killed Mion-san for you!!!"`
`"We felt sorry for you always having to suffer punishments, so we let you shoot us!!`
` You should appreciate our sacrifice...!!!"`
`"...Oh, really?`
` This is getting interesting.`
` What do you think, Kei-chan?"`
`"What do you mean...?`
` What do you want me to do...?"`
`"Well, Kameda-kun, Tomita, and Okamura.`
`Why don't you challenge Kei-chan and Rena for the position of the winners?"`
`"What?`
` Mii-chan, what do you mean by that? What do you mean?"`
`"They defeated many fighters and won a massive victory yesterday.`
`I'm pretty sure a battle against these guys would be trivial, right?"`
`Kameda-kun clapped his hands with glee.`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun nodded in agreement. They looked fired up already...`
`Damn it. I have to fight against them here?!!`
`"Now that I think about it, the game was a tie.`
` It'll be fun to have the finale here with a few extra fighters."`
`"......If you lose the game, you join in on the punishment."`
`"...Damn it!`
` I hate it when you make it sound persuasive... What do you think, Rena?"`
`"I'm fine with it because I'm going to win!!`
` I'm taking them home with me!!`
` I wonder what kind of costume you'll have to wear~☆.`
`I'm taking all of you home with me!!!"`
`Sh-She sure is motivated...`
`I could see Kameda-kun was ready to fight for the ticket to paradise at Angel Mort.`
`My two underclassmen were also eager to have a chance to fight against the members of the club for the first time.`
`"Kyousuke Irie, reporting to volunteer for the game too!!`
` Yeah!!!"`
`"Well, well.`
`Okay!`
` Let's start the game with these members.`
` Rena and Kei-chan, do you have any objections?"`
`"I don't think you'd take an objection even if I had one."`
`"Well, don't you like to make the game interesting?`
` Aha ha ha ha."`
`"It's now or never if you want to change your mind, Tomita-san and Okamura-san.`
` As you already know, you have to undergo the punishment if you lose."`
`"W-We know that...!"`
`"We're men, too!`
` We've always wanted to fight against you!!"`
`They've seen the many horrifying punishments we had to suffer and they still had the courage to join in.`
` ...I had to admit, they have potential...!`
`Kameda, the evil Lord of Angel Mort, sneered at the two...!`
`"Huh huh huh!`
` I never thought I'd have the chance to fight against you again, K-san!`
` I'm going to fight fair and square this time!!"`
`"...I didn't expect to fight you here at Angel Mort, either...`
` I'm pretty sure you'll be an even tougher enemy to defeat here than in the baseball game..."`
`Coach Irie, the Count of Maids, laughed like he was afraid of nothing!!`
`"Well... I'll show you how serious an adult can be.`
`And!!`
` Today here at Angel Mort, I'm going to have a harem that is for me alone!!!"`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` I won't let any of you win!!`
` Hauuuu!!"`
`"...Alright!!`
` I'm ready.`
` I can't keep complaining.`
` Mion!`
` What kind of game are we playing?!"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` That's the spirit!`
`Make way, everybody!!`
` Waitress, please bring it over!!"`
`In the kitchen, the real waitresses are standing by with many desserts on trays.`
`It looks like... the game is going to be either a speed-eating`
` or a competitive eating contest!`
`"...Manager...`
` are you sure we can do this?"`
`"Yeah, go ahead and bring them the desserts!`
` The more interesting the better.`
` I want this event to be as exciting as possible!"`
`The waitresses checked with their manager and started bringing in the desserts.`
`The two of my underclassmen, Kameda-kun, Coach, Rena, and I sat at a table together.`
`A horrific amount of desserts was brought before us.`
`I wanted to enjoy watching the cute waitresses placing desserts on the table... but right now, I was in a fighting mood.`
` I had no time for that!!`
`The audience surrounding our table seemed to have grown excited, too.`
`I bet it didn't even cross their minds that they would see a serious battle at Angel Mort today.`
` But they didn't care,`
` as long as it's fun to watch!`
`"Listen up.`
` This is a competitive eating contest. Whoever eats the most within the time limit wins. `
`We already know how heavy each dessert is, so we will calculate the total weight of desserts you ate after the game is over, and whoever ate the most weight will win!"`
`When the words "competitive eating" came up, Kameda-kun smiled evilly!`
`Damn it, Kameda-kun had the advantage!`
`"Mion-san, can you count the two of us as one person because we always fight together?"`
`"Hm?`
` Yeah, that's fine.`
` Since you're always together,`
` I'll permit it!"`
`Damn it, having two stomachs for a competitive eating contest was an absolute advantage too!`
`"What about you, Rena?`
` I'm sure a competitive eating contest is a bit of a hard game for a girl."`
`"No worries! If it means I can take these adorable girls home with me, I'd even swallow a table!!"`
`...I underestimated her...`
` Rena can overcome physical impossibilities once she goes into Kyute Mode...`
`She might even be able to eat food that's heavier than herself...!`
`"Coach... what about you?`
` Are you good at competitive eating?"`
`"...Maebara-san,`
` as long as there's a maid and a condition that I need to meet in order to get her,`
`nothing is impossible to me...!!"`
`I could see a black aura surrounding him, which I found very intimidating...`
`The glint from the eyes that shone from behind his lenses was sharp enough to pierce an iron board!`
`Damn it, he was in Maid Mode, which is equally as strong as Rena's Kyute Mode...!!`
`Shit, I was the only one without any advantages...!!`
`"Are you ready?`
` Set`
`...`
`...`
` Go!!"`
`I wasn't ready emotionally, but Mion started the game without hesitation.`
`Damn it, there was no turning back!!`
` I had to do this!`
` There were many kinds of desserts before us.`
` Some were easy to eat and some were not! `
`So, I had to get the dessert that's the easiest to eat before anybody got it!!!`
` What about the yogurt parfait?!`
` Ohhhryaaaahhh!!!`
`...But of course, everybody seemed to be thinking the same thing.`
`Everybody reached out for the same dessert as fast as they could!!!`
`A white light flashed in front of our eyes, and the parfait disappeared.`
`My hands clash with the others' in midair.`
`"Ahahahaha, you're too slow!`
` I got it first!`
` Hau!"`
`Rena took the parfait. She was literally as fast as lightning.`
`Damn it, I knew it!!`
` There was no way I can beat Rena in the opening move!!`
`Rena took the parfait like a frog catching a fly with its tongue, and swallowed it in a single gulp!!`
`She did all that in seconds. She's usually gentle and calm, but she's a totally different person right now. Really, it's terrifying.`
`I see. I now understand why people say women always have room for dessert!!!`
`But, in the special environment of Angel Mort, Kameda-kun wasn't far behind Rena!!`
`He grabbed a fruit parfait and swallowed it as if drinking beer from a mug!!`
`It looked very dynamic!!`
`"...BURP.`
` ...Heh heh heh!!`
` K-san, you're wasting your time. You don't even have a 1% chance to defeat me in a battle at Angel Mort!!`
` Just watch me!!!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun look at the extraordinary techniques Rena and Kameda-kun are displaying, but they seem to be very calm.`
`They knew their advantage.`
`As long as they kept a steady pace, they could eat more and eat faster than anybody else, because there are two of them!`
`Rena and Kameda-kun were eating very fast, but they might slow down in the middle. So, this was going to be an unpredictable race...!!`
`Son of a bitch, I won't lose this game!!`
`I shoved my dessert into my mouth and kept`
` eating.`
` Kept eating.`
` I just kept eating!!`
`Ow ow ow!`
` Damn it, my mouth got extremely cold when I swallowed a ball of ice cream!!`
` How could the others do this so easily?`
` ...Hm?`
` There's an idea.`
` I should melt it first! `
`I could use some kind of heat to melt it first and then drink it down!`
` Plus, it would also be easier for my stomach to take when it's not so cold!!`
`B-But, how should I melt it?`
` It would take too long to use body heat, and I didn't have any other source of heat with me...`
`"Waitress, can I order something?`
`I'd like to have hot coffee.`
` Could you bring it to me in a big pot instead of a cup?"`
`"C-Coach...!!"`
`"Maebara-san, you're too slow.`
` I also got the idea to melt it with heat."`
`No! Damn it!!`
` He was one step ahead of me...!`
`I could order hot coffee, too.`
`But, I'd still be one step behind him.`
`I'd have to come up with something to melt my ice cream faster than hot coffee!!`
