`"He proposed to me."`
`My father proposed?`
` To <i>her</i>??`
` That's a lie!`
` That's a big lie...!!`
`"It's something he wanted, so who am I to refuse?`
` He gave me a ring already, too.`
` Plus, we started this relationship with marriage in mind.`
`If he changed his mind after putting a ring on me... that'd be quite a big problem nowadays, you know?"`
