`"Wh-Who are you people?!"`
`"Move over.`
` Who's in charge here?"`
`Several cars had arrived, producing several men. They weren't from the Okinomiya station.`
`One of the men was wearing a suit, despite the hot weather. He approached me, pushing Kumagai aside.`
`"...Hey, look who's here.`
` Good to see you again, Ootaka-kun from the prefectural headquarters."`
`"Watch your mouth.`
` I'm ranked much higher than you now, so don't address me so casually."`
`"Can I help you with something, Ootaka-<i>kun</i>?`
` I'm rather busy at the moment.`
` You can't possibly be thinking about taking over this case?`
` Who approved that, exactly?"`
`"I did, Ooishi-kun!"`
`"Ch-Chief...?"`
`"Takasugi-kun has informed me of the situation.`
` He also told me that you started all this.`
` You can go now. The troops will take over!"`
`"The troops? ...Ootaka-kun, you aren't going to storm the building, are you?"`
`"I understand the risk.`
` But we don't have any time left before the bomb goes off.`
` You've taken too long.`
` We're here to take care of the mess you left behind.`
` Just step back for a minute."`
`I couldn't talk back if both the chief and a guy from the prefectural headquarters gave me an order.`
`"O...Ooishi-san, who the heck is he?"`
`"That's Ootaka-kun.`
` Nfu fu, a long time ago, he was showing off even though he was bad at mahjong, so I taught him a lesson. `
`Or maybe he's still holding a grudge from when I knocked him unconscious in that kendo tournament."`
`Obviously, we didn't get along.`
`"Give me the latest update, Ooishi-kun."`
`"Are you serious about storming the school?`
` We were about to settle this thing peacefully with some sleeping pills.`
` What are you trying to accomplish here?"`
`"It's too late for that.`
` If we had another hour, that would be possible.`
` Instead, a special unit from the prefectural police department will move in.`
` Your unit will be their backup."`
`"...Chief.`
` You know what's going on, don't you?`
` That classroom itself has turned into a huge bomb!`
` But even the classroom isn't the bomb we're scared of.`
` It's the suspect, Rena Ryuugu!! `
`We finally calmed her down and found a way to settle this peacefully, and we were about to start that operation.`
` I know we only have about ten minutes,`
` but I'll make sure this works!!`
` I'll continue negotiating. `
`If it doesn't work, I'll be blown up.`
` Then you can sit back and say 'I told you so,' okay?"`
`"Ooishi-kun,`
` the special unit from the prefectural police department isn't just any old unit.`
` You've heard about the Second Company, haven't you?"`
`"What's that, Ooishi-san?`
` Is this "Second Company" that well known?"`
`"Do you remember, about five years ago,`
` when the JRA hijacked that airplane? Flight 472?`
` I've heard that special counter-terrorist units were put together in Tokyo and Osaka after that incident. `
`So they really do exist..."`
`"B-But why would a special unit from Osaka be here?"`
`Ootaka smiled proudly.`
`"We just happened to be holding a training session with your prefectural police unit.`
` We requested their help."`
`"Na ha ha... you haven't changed, have you?`
` ...You have a bad tendency to escalate matters quickly."`
`The Company members exited the vehicles one after another and took position.`
`They didn't move like policemen...`
`"Ootaka-kun!`
` Are you really going to have a gunfight here?`
` One shot is all it'll take to trigger an explosion!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` They won't use firearms.`
` They're using riot shields and riot guns.`
` These guns send out tear gas at high pressures.`
` There will be no issue with explosions."`
`"......Wow, I've never heard of such convenient water guns.`
` By the way, can that toy reach the classroom from across the schoolyard?"`
`"You don't need to worry about that.`
` You just move over and let us do our job."`
`As I lifted my arms exaggeratedly, one elbow accidentally touched the car horn, which honked.`
` .........Of course, I did it on purpose...`
`"Are you trying to get Keiichi Maebara's attention?"`
`"Of course.`
` I just hope he heard it..."`
`"What are you going to tell him now?"`
`"They're probably thinking about breaking one of the windows with a grenade and then shooting tear gas into the room.`
` ...They have no idea how serious Rena Ryuugu is.`
` Deadly serious. `
`Even the noise of a window breaking could drive her over the edge...!"`
`"Are you saying the special unit can't suppress her?"`
`"Of course not!`
` That's why we've been so careful!`
` Rena Ryuugu has been intending to kill herself this whole time.`
` A raid doesn't work on people who don't care about dying!`
` ...We only have Maebara-san now!"`
`"O-Ooishi-san!`
` Here he is!"`
`"Hello, this is Ooishi.`
` If you can hear me, please cough."`
`"Cough, cough..."`
`"This is an emergency.`
` Please listen."`
`"I have a feeling it's not good news..."`
`"Unfortunately, you're right.`
` The prefectural police are getting involved. They're going to ruin everything we've worked for so far.`
` There's a special unit about to break in."`
`"H-Hey, the only reason I haven't used my pepper spray is because that won't stop her from igniting the gas...`
` A raid won't work...!"`
`"The prefectural police don't understand that Ryuugu-san is prepared to die.`
` They're assuming the lighter is just a threat and that she isn't really going to ignite the gas. `
`They'll break in within five minutes or so.`
` Please take the lighter from Rena Ryuugu before they move in!"`
`"Is that an addition to your order to do something about the time bomb?"`
`"...Yes, that's right."`
`"You've got to be kidding me...`
` You want me to take the lighter from Rena and do something about the time bomb too, all within five minutes?`
` ...Come on......"`
`"You're the only one we can count on...!`
` I'm begging you...!!!"`
`"How is it, Satoko?`
` Can you think of something?"`
`".........I just have to check the hallway on the first floor.`
` To check whether it is there or not.`
`Knowing Rena-san's patterns, if it was on the first floor, it would be <i>there</i>, and if it was on the second floor, it would be <i>there</i>..."`
`"I just have to check to see if there is a cord in the hallway on the first floor, right?"`
`"......It should be there.`
` .........Tch,`
` if Rena-san was in a normal state of mind, I would know for certain... but with her being like this, I really cannot figure out her thought pattern right now..."`
`"Okay, I'll do something.`
` We don't even have time to think about it.`
` I'll look into those two options myself!"`
`I don't want another tragedy.`
`You demons down in Hell, I bet you're just waiting for an amusing ending to unfold while eating some popcorn.`
`I won't let that happen. I'm going to change everything!!`
`And then I'm going to make you pick up your popcorn off the floor!!`
`I spoke to Rena as she continued on with her story about the aliens.`
`"What is it?`
` What's the matter, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"Hey... didn't you hear something just now?"`
`".................."`
`Rena went quiet and looked around...`
`Rena had become totally paranoid about everything.`
`Once she became worried, she couldn't ignore it...`
`"............Really?`
` Are you sure, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm sure I heard something."`
`"....................."`
`I knew she'd want to check it herself.`
`But she really couldn't leave the room for something like that...`
`So in that case, she'd have to ask me to check for her.`
`Rena must have been thinking the same thing.`
`"............Keiichi-kun,`
` can you go check?"`
`Rena gave me an order with a fake smile on her lips.`
`"Yeah...... okay......"`
`Rena watched me go out into the hallway.`
` As I did, she spoke to me.`
`"Don't... make me angry ......okay?"`
`"Trust me.`
` I'm your friend."`
`"......Yeah. ...I trust you.`
` I trust you...... so don't betray me, okay...?"`
`After being freed from Rena, I looked for a cord in a hurry.`
` I didn't even have five minutes!`
`The office probably had more outlets than anywhere else...`
`I headed for the teacher's office.`
`Shit, where were the outlets?`
`Unlike light switches, outlets couldn't always be found near entrances...`
`Damn it, why did the clock in the teacher's office have to make such a loud ticking noise?`
`"......Don't worry, Keiichi will find it."`
`"Rena-san would... if I were Rena-san...`
`......`
`if Rena-san was even more mistrusting than usual...`
` where would she set the trap?`
` A trap expert like myself ought to be able to discern that!!"`
`"Hmm? What's this...?"`
`I saw a plug inserted into the unit under the principal's desk, and I also saw a cord extending under the door to the reception room.`
`There shouldn't have been any reason why a cord had to be extended into that room. `
`The reception room had an outlet of its own.`
`I tiptoed over to the reception room... and opened the door.`
`Squeak...`
`The door squeaked as I cracked it open a little.`
`I poked my head inside the reception room.`
` I saw the suspicious cord crossing the room and extending under the door to the hallway.`
`I followed the cord through the reception room.`
` I opened the door to the hallway... and the cord was extending into the storage closet.`
`The storage closet was used to hold cleaning chemicals. I could smell them from here.`
`The cord was extending into there...`
`I carefully opened the door and turned the light on.`
`The cord was attached to another extension cord...`
` and`
` there was an alarm clock that didn't belong in there!!!`
`"I......`
` found it...!"`
`The time bomb!!!`
`So all I'd have to do was to unplug the cord!`
`I picked up the alarm clock.`
`...It looked like a normal alarm clock.`
`...Actually, it was a normal alarm clock.`
`I remembered Kumagai-san calling it a "kitchen timer".`
` He said it was a bit like an alarm clock.`
`But this wasn't a bit like an alarm clock, it <i>was</i> an alarm clock...`
`Wait, didn't alarm clocks use batteries?`
`This alarm clock was a battery-operated one, too...`
`I looked at the extension cord...... and there was nothing plugged into it.`
`...Eh?`
`What was this extension cord for?`
` ...Why was this`
` extending all the way from the teacher's office...?`
`"No, Keiichi-san!!`
` Run!!!"`
`"S-Satoko?"`
`"That's the wrong place! You've been tricked!!!"`
`A black shadow was covering me.`
`I felt my body freeze... It was so frozen that I felt it was about to crack...`
`I turned around slowly...... and saw someone holding a hatchet above their head.`
`"......Ah... ah......"`
`I dropped the alarm clock.`
`It made a noise as it hit the ground.`
`"......Why did you follow the extension cord`
` and why did you have the alarm clock in your hands? ...Why did you?"`
`All the cells in my body were frozen.`
` This was Rena's trap.`
`Rena was suspicious of everyone, including me...`
`This whole time, she thought there was someone connected to the people outside...`
`This was a trap to lure that person out...`
`Only the people outside knew about the time bomb.`
`...I was told about the whole thing`
` and so I followed the extension cord`
` and picked up the alarm clock... How stupid of me.`
`"...W`
`...Wait,`
` Rena..."`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, I trusted you, Keiichi-kun...`
`How could you..."`
`Rena hit me with the back side of the hatchet earlier.`
`It was painful, but it didn't kill me.`
`But this time, she was holding the hatchet the right way.`
`It wouldn't just crack my forehead.`
` It would split my entire head open...!!!`
`Rena lifted the hatchet mercilessly...`
`She moved slowly, as if everything was in slow motion... she looked almost divine...`
`Maybe it really was holy.`
`I was praying, after all...`
`Praying?`
`What was I praying for...?`
`I was praying for my life......!!!`
`"Whahhhhh!!!"`
`It was so sudden, I couldn't tell what happened.`
`Rika-chan had jumped onto Rena from behind.`
`I didn't know what kind of weapon Rika-chan used, but Rena started moaning. It clearly hurt.`
`That brought me back to reality!`
`I couldn't just watch them!!`
`I had to get the lighter from Rena!!!`
`"Whahhh!!!"`
`"...Don't think you can win with mere force!!!"`
`Rena knew I was after the lighter. She closed her fingers around it tightly!`
`Rika-chan was grabbing onto the arm Rena was holding the hatchet in.`
`I wanted to tell her to run, but thanks to Rika-chan, I could use both of my hands to get at the lighter!!`
`"Whaahh!!!"`
`The lighter flew out of Rena's hand.`
`It hit the hallway wall and dropped down to the floor!`
`I picked it up.`
`At the same moment I did, Rena managed to shake off Rika-chan.`
`...There's our chance!`
`I turned in Satoko's direction.`
