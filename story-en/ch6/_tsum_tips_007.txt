`It's still June, yet the air is filled with the cries of cicadas. How is everyone in Hinamizawa doing?`
`The Watanagashi festival is coming just around the corner.`
`We staff members from the forestry service are going to perform a wood sculpting demonstration at the festival.`
`We'll be happy to lend out our tools and teach your kids how to sculpt wood themselves. It'll be an excellent memorial gift!`
`Also, we would like to inform everyone that we're going to cut down trees in the local hills this summer as part of the No. XX 4th Forest Landscape Management Project.`
`This project involves preserving the beauty of the forest by cutting down old trees and planting new ones.`
`The forestry service needs volunteers who are interested in helping us cut down the old trees.`
`You can enjoy the beauty of nature under the blue sky while helping out with this preservation activity.`
`The project will begin during summer break, so you can bring your kids, too.`
`This will be a good opportunity for your kids to learn about nature and have a valuable experience.`
`The locations of the project are the forests in the Takatsudo and Yagouchi areas.`
