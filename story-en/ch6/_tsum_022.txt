`At lunchtime the next day,`
` everybody in class was talking about Rena's disappearance.`
`We were all worried about her safety... but I kept a safe distance from everybody else.`
`"...I do wonder where she went.`
` Someone said that she was demoned away.`
` How can they say such things? I can't believe their nerve!"`
`"Keiichi-san, you look down today..."`
`"...Meep."`
`Satoko and Rika-chan noticed something odd about my attitude.`
`".........I... ummm..."`
`"...??"`
`I couldn't sleep at all last night because of what Rena told me.`
`Friends don't keep secrets from one another.`
`That sentence bit into my heart... and I couldn't sleep because of the pain.`
`"Mion.`
` ...Satoko, and Rika-chan too.`
` ...I have something I need to talk to you about."`
`"...Is it about Rena?"`
`"No... it's not.`
` It's about me..."`
`I decided to tell them about it, because they were my friends.`
`...But I didn't know what I was expecting to change by doing so.`
`They might despise me... Was there any benefit in telling them?`
`...No, there wasn't. I knew that for sure.`
`But I still wanted to tell them about it, just because I thought it'd help heal the pain I was feeling.`
`"What is this about, Keiichi-san...?"`
`"...Well... It's the truth about myself.`
` I'd appreciate it if you listened to me."`
`"............"`
`"It's about what happened to me before I moved here.`
` I was a kind of guy who wasn't good at anything but studying."`
`I learned the tricks of the game called studying at my cram school.`
` I enjoyed the sense of superiority I felt by getting good grades. I kept studying just because I wanted to look down on the other students.`
`When my grades got better, my parents got happier, and my teachers praised me.`
` I felt good.`
`It was fun to look down on the students who were good at running, dodgeball, or swimming. That was the only reason I kept studying.`
`Before I knew it, not only was I the top of my class, I was the top of my school.`
`So, I started to think I was the most important student there.`
`I looked down on the kids who were playing in the schoolyard during lunch break. I enjoyed feeling a sense of superiority to them in my insignificance.`
`...The more I studied, the better everybody expected me to do.`
`They started to place high hopes on me. They expected me to go to the best school in Japan.`
`I flattered myself in thinking I deserved to go to that school as well.`
`But... The fun went out of looking down on people, while the burden of studying didn't change a bit.`
`My classmates stopped admiring my cleverness after a while, and my teachers started to push me to study more.`
`All of a sudden, the fun had gone out of it.`
`To begin with, I didn't even like to study.`
`I had average reflexes. I was average in a fight. I was an average boy with nothing that really drew attention. So when I found something that I could use to get that attention, I jumped on it.`
`It happened to be studying for me, but if it was riding a unicycle or juggling, I would've done that, too.`
`When I realized I didn't enjoy studying anymore, it got very boring.`
`I was just a little boy who wanted to be praised when I did something better than anybody else.`
`...I finished all of my summer homework because my parents praised me for it, and I took charge of cleaning duties at school because my teachers praised me for it.`
`So when they stopped praising me for what I did, I began to feel as though my life had no meaning.`
`My parents used to give me an allowance that was proportional to how good my grades were, so I used to get a substantial amount of money for my age.`
`...I don't know if I had a natural interest in violence, or if I was looking for it because of my frustration at the time.`
`I took an interest in BB guns.`
`At first, I shot at cardboard boxes. It was fun.`
`Being violent at pieces of cardboard relieved a lot of stress.`
` Nobody blamed me for doing that.`
`But soon, I started wanting to do something I should never have done.`
`On the box that my BB gun came in was a warning label that read "do not shoot at people".`
` That was when I thought about doing just that.`
`Why did I do something I shouldn't have?`
` I guess I was just immature.`
`I wasn't interested in studying anymore, but I forced myself to do so anyway. My parents forced me to go to several cram schools. I was mad at them for that.`
`I should've told them I didn't want to study anymore.`
`...But I didn't have the courage to do that.`
`...So, I used my frustration as an excuse to do something cowardly: I shot at kids who were younger than I was with my BB gun.`
`It gave me such a thrill.`
`It felt so good to do something bad when I was so overcome with studying.`
`Needless to say, I had no personal grudge against the kids I shot.`
`As long as the kids passed through a deserted street, they met the requirements to become my target.`
`I didn't mean to hurt them.`
`I shot at them once or twice from a distance. That was all I wanted to do.`
`But sometimes, they didn't react at all because the BBs hit a thicker part of their clothes or something.`
`...I didn't like that, so I started to shoot until they noticed they were being hit.`
`It inevitably escalated into a barrage of gunfire.`
`I study a lot. I'm doing something good.`
`So, I deserve to do something bad to balance out the good thing I'm doing.`
`That was the unbelievably selfish excuse I made.`
`I thought I had a right to do things like that, because I was suffering myself.`
`I thought people who weren't suffering like I was deserved to be shot at and to get hurt a little bit.`
`...I was so selfish, so arrogant, and so immature!`
`I was disgusted with myself.`
`If I could have met myself at that time, I would've given myself a punch in the face so hard that I'd knock out all of my teeth.`
`They started to call it "a series of attacks on school children". `
`The principal of my school held a morning assembly to inform everyone about the case and to warn them to be careful when playing outside. I was laughing sneakily.`
`The PTA issued a letter of warning and advice to take the safest way to and from school. Parents took turns watching kids when they walked between home and school in groups.`
`The more serious it got, the more it reminded me of the excitement I first felt when my grades started going up.`
`I was absorbed in that game I was playing.`
`I didn't think that I'd get caught someday. I didn't even think to stop doing it, either.`
`One day.`
`...I found a little girl who was walking down a narrow dark street, all alone.`
` She was a very small girl.`
`I don't know if she was on her way to her friend's house, or if she was running an errand.`
` I didn't care which.`
`It was careless of her to go out alone. The school had warned her not to.`
`So, it was her fault.`
`Just like always, I made a selfish excuse...`
` and attacked her.`
`Some of the shots hit her in the back. She noticed she was attacked by somebody.`
`She turned around. It was a natural reaction.`
`At that time, I didn't hesitate to rain hell upon her.`
`So when she turned around, I was still shooting at her.`
`Usually when I shot at a kid, she cried in pain and ran away.`
`...But this girl was different.`
`She thrashed around in excruciating pain, holding one of her eyes.`
`When I saw her doing that, I realized what had happened right away.`
`The BB had hit her in the eye.`
`Until that moment, I didn't think about what would happen when a pellet that could easily go through a cardboard box hit an eyeball.`
`Anyway,`
` the girl howled in pain,`
` and for the first time`
` I realized I had done something horrible.`
`She saw me.`
`So I couldn't take her to a hospital.`
`I couldn't do anything about it... so I left her there while she was still screaming in pain.`
`I wondered if she was okay, and I worried that she had lost her eye.`
`I kept thinking about her, and I didn't even feel like eating that day.`
`I went to the bookshelf in our living room, snuck a medical book to my room, and studied the structure of the human eye.`
`It was too late to make a difference, but I studied what kind of injuries would make a person lose their vision.`
`I knew it wouldn't make the sin I committed weigh any less even if I found out that she wouldn't lose her sight.`
`...I couldn't sleep that night, and I suffered from a high fever.`
`It wasn't my parents, my teachers, or the police who first punished me for what I did... It was my own body.`
`Before dawn.`
`...I woke my parents up and confessed to my sin.`
`They were shocked at first, but it seemed like they understood the situation quickly due to my recent disobedient behavior and my interest in BB guns.`
`My mom cried hysterically. My dad slapped me in the face 'til it swelled up.`
`Before the sun came up, I turned myself in to the police, accompanied by my parents.`
`Satoko stared at me with a stunned expression.`
`I deserved to receive that kind of look.`
`What I did was very wrong, and I needed to accept that...`
`"......Is that all... true...?"`
`"Yes...`
` It's all true.`
` ...I'm sorry I didn't tell you until now..."`
`".........What made you want to tell us?"`
`Mion asked me. Rika-chan nodded in agreement.`
`"To tell you the truth...`
` I don't understand why."`
`"...Well... I know, but..."`
`"No.`
` I'm just saying that I don't see any reason why you had to tell us about it."`
`"Well......`
` I didn't want to keep secrets from my friends.`
` ...You're my friends,`
` so... I couldn't hide it from you anymore."`
`"...What are you expecting us to do?"`
`"I'm not... expecting anything.`
` ...I just..."`
`"......If you're asking for forgiveness, I can't give it to you.`
` You have to ask the kids you attacked if you want that.`
` It won't help any to tell us about it."`
`"I agree with Rika.`
` ...I think you're really brave to tell us, but... I don't understand what you want to do from here on out."`
`"...I don't want to do anything...`
` ...I just thought... it's not right to keep secrets from my friends..."`
`My friends looked annoyed by the sudden confession of my past.`
`I took it as bitter medicine. I got what I deserved.`
`"Kei-chan,`
` I have a question.`
`...Why can't friends keep secrets from each other?"`
`"What?"`
`"I mean, that's what you're saying, but...`
` I really don't agree."`
`"......I don't agree, either."`
`Mion and Rika-chan obviously disagreed with my statement.`
` Satoko nodded, following suit.`
`"I don't think it's wrong to refuse to tell people things you'd rather not.`
` We all have lots of things we don't want to tell anyone else about, like tragedies, mistakes, and other things you don't want to remember.`
`If I'd have to tell someone everything to be true friends with them, I wouldn't want to have them as my friends at all."`
`"...B-But..."`
`"...Keiichi,`
` there's a difference between things you don't need to confess and things you have to confess.`
` You have to confess what you did to receive forgiveness.`
`But once you're forgiven, you don't need to keep confessing."`
`"Quite.`
` ...You turned yourself in to the police, and they scolded you good, did they not?`
`You atoned for your sin, and you were forgiven. What more do you have to do?"`
`"You turned yourself in, and you accepted the result. You did what you had to do.`
`It's very important that you keep reminding yourself of your sin`
` so that you won't make the same mistake again.`
`...But you only have to take care of that on your own. It's not something you have to confess to everybody."`
`"That's very true.`
` I have many embarrassing stories that I'd rather not tell anyone."`
`"......Meep.`
` Satoko does have quite a lot of them."`
`"I-It's not only me!!`
` Rika has a heap of them too!!"`
`"Meep☆ meep☆ meep☆!"`
`Satoko and Rika-chan fooled around with each other like they always did.`
`Mion looked at them and then looked back at me.`
`"Satoko just said something very important.`
` ...Did you get it?"`
`"...You mean the part where she said she has a dark past that nobody needs to know about?"`
`"No, no!`
` The bit after that.`
`She's saying that everybody has something they'd rather hide.`
` Considering that nobody grows up in a sterilized room, we all learn by trial and error. That's called life, you know?`
`You do both good things and bad things in order to grow up. Your goal is to become a wonderful person by the end.`
`Everything that happens is a very important experience, including both the good and the bad. `
`The same goes with everybody, with Satoko, Rika-chan, and me, too.`
` The same applies to everybody in this class."`
`"...For example, Mii used to be a very bad girl.`
` Meow. Meow."`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` ...Well, I'm not proud of it or anything,`
` but shooting at people with a BB gun is like nothing compared to what I did!`
`I used to throw bricks at people. `
`I can't even count how many times I ended up in a cell at the police station.`
` During the dam conflict, I was a regular there.`
` I'm not kidding. It's all true."`
`"...But it happened in the past.`
` And she doesn't have to tell you about it`
` even though she's your friend."`
`"Even though she's my friend..."`
`"...I made... a lot of embarrassing mistakes and committed some crimes, too.`
` But I don't tell you about them, because telling you wouldn't help in any way."`
`"If you feel better by telling us about your past, we'll listen.`
` But there's no rule that says you have to tell us about your past just because we're friends! `
`I don't want to dig up a past that you don't want to talk about. That's what true friends are all about, I think."`
`"...I... I agree with you, but..."`
`"We're happy if you feel better now by telling us about your past.`
` We can forget about it if you want us to.`
` We'll never change the way we see you because of this."`
`"......What you did in the city has nothing to do with who you are right now.`
`You're a precious friend to us. I actually don't want to know about your past, to be honest with you."`
`"I agree with Rika.`
` The same thing goes the other way around. Even if you did something great in the city, but if you were a nasty person here, I wouldn't care what great things you did back then."`
`"In other words, Kei-chan,`
` the sin you committed in the city is something that you should keep secret in your heart. You don't need to dig it back up just to tell us.`
`I mean, you can if you want. `
`And if anybody changed the way they saw you because of that, I'd look down on them!"`
`"No matter what happened in the past, as long as you're a great person at present, you shouldn't be embarrassed of yourself. Am I wrong?`
`What's the purpose of living if we can never earn redemption?"`
`"......Satoko used to be a big baby who couldn't do anything by herself.`
` She regretted it deeply, and now she's a strong independent girl.`
`That's why I admire Satoko today.`
` I don't care how weak she used to be."`
`"...Rika..."`
`"What about you, Kei-chan?`
`Are you going to change the way you see me because you now know I used to be a very bad girl who was a regular at the police station?`
`You won't, will you?`
` I am who I am. `
`Our friendship won't change, and we'll keep playing and laughing like we always do, right?`
` That's what being friends is all about."`
`What...?`
` What...? What's going on............?`
`...Mion is trying to cheer me up with an encouraging smile on her face, but her expression became distorted all of a sudden...`
`Big teardrops... fell`
` from my eyes...`
`...What?`
` ............Why`
` am I crying...?`
`"Let me just say this.`
` I didn't know anything about Satoshi.`
` ...Because you all hid it from me."`
`"...W-We didn't mean to hide it..."`
`"You didn't tell me about the incidents that happen every year, right?"`
`"Ah, that's because... we didn't want to...`
` ummm..."`
`"You didn't want to scare me?!`
` Just because of that, you left me out?!"`
`"No, we didn't mean to..."`
`Mion didn't know what to say. She had tears in her eyes.`
`...She thought she did me a favor. She didn't know why it turned out like this.`
`She didn't want to make me scared of the village, since I'd just moved here.`
` ...What more reason did she need?!`
`"I asked you before, Mion, if there was a crime at the dam construction site.`
` ...You told me there was none!!!`
` But there was a dismemberment lynch murder!!!`
` You lied!!!"`
`"I-I'm sorry...!!!`
` I didn't mean to lie to you..."`
`"I thought friends didn't hide things from each other.`
` Right?!`
` So, that makes us not friends!!"`
`Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!`
`What are friends?`
` What are friends?`
` What were friends to me?!!`
`They were my true friends.`
`They really cared about me.`
`They were so nice to me, and helped me feel at home in this village!!`
`I couldn't have been happier!`
`Everything was great, wasn't it?`
`"K-Kei-chan...... Please don't......"`
`Mion seemed like she didn't know what to say.`
`Her eyes looked moist.`
` ...It was hard to believe she was really acting like this. It wasn't like Mion at all.`
`I could feel her pain. She was in pain because she didn't know what I was blaming her for...`
`She looked so sad... but I didn't notice her pain!`
`I thought I was her friend!!`
`I didn't understand her feelings. I didn't trust her!`
`I just used the word "friends," but I didn't do anything like what friends were supposed to do!!!`
`"...That's right... I was such a fool...!!`
` Mion was Mion... She was my best friend!!`
` Why did I doubt her?!`
` Why?!"`
`"Kei-chan looks down these days."`
`"He just moved here from the city.`
`I guess the fatigue must be setting in.`
` He probably caught a cold as a result."`
`"I see.`
` Then, he needs to eat something nutritious!`
` My grandma is making ohagi today.`
` I'm going to ask her to give me some so we can bring them to Kei-chan!"`
`"Oi, Mion! Wash your hands first!!!`
` Hello, Rena-chan, would you like to try making one, too?"`
`"Wow... that looks like fun!`
`Yes, I'd love to try.`
` Here we go!"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` I have a great idea."`
`"What is it, Mii-chan?`
`...What's that little bottle? ...What is it?!"`
`"It's not fun to only have sweet ohagi, you know?`
`Heh heh heh, let's put hot sauce in one of them. It'll wake him up for sure!"`
`That's right. ...That's what happened!!!`
`They brought ohagi for me to help me get better... They only tried to cheer me up!!`
`Why did I get so scared of them?!`
`Just because Mion knew I had lunch at Angel Mort, I grew terrified of her!`
`"Hey, you don't look good.`
` Maybe you should go lie down."`
`"That's right,`
` maybe we should leave."`
`They just wanted to cheer me up with a joke.`
`But... because I looked so serious...`
`"See you."`
`Please get better soon.`
` I hope we can hang out in the club together tomorrow!`
`That was a normal way of saying goodbye...!!`
`"I don't want you to be absent from school tomorrow, okay?"`
`...First of all, have I ever visited any of my classmates who were absent with a cold?`
`No, I haven't!`
`I've never done such a nice thing to anybody, because it's too much of a bother!`
`But they did that for me!!`
`I understand visiting a friend in a hospital, but I just caught a cold...!`
`But they came to visit me with ohagi so that I could get better soon...!!`
`I should've been thankful to them and said, "I'll get better soon, and I'm sure I can come to school tomorrow!!`
` So, I'll see you then!!" ...That was what I was supposed to say!!`
`But what did I do instead?!`
`I locked the door!!`
`I closed the door and locked it as if rejecting them!!`
`What was I so scared of? What was I so afraid of?!!`
`Why didn't I say any words of appreciation to my friends who cared about me?!!`
`I was just so scared of the ohagi they brought for me!!!`
`What was I thinking?!!`
`It was impossible that there was a needle in one of them!!!`
`There wasn't actually a needle at all!!`
`It was all in my head, because I had read some manga about someone putting needles or razor blades in people's food.`
`...It scared me so much that......`
` I believed`
` it could also happen to me`
` for some reason...... and I thought there was a needle in the ohagi...!!!`
`You were so stupid, Keiichi!!!`
`Why would your friends put a needle in food they only brought to make you get better?!?!`
`It was crazy to think like that!!`
`Even if`
` there was a needle in one of them, I should've thought that it was some kind of mistake, and I should've believed in my friends' innocence!!!`
` That's what a true friend would do!! But what did I do?!`
`Pound!`
` Splatter!`
` Smash!`
`I threw the ohagi that they spent so much effort making on the floor!!`
`Why?!`
` Why did I do that?!`
`I got along so well with them.`
`I moved to Hinamizawa, and I made friends for the first time in my life.`
`They were my best friends.`
`Meeting them was the most wonderful experience of my life. I'd probably never have another one like that for the rest of my days.`
`I knew that, but...... I got scared, and I doubted them!`
`They noticed that I was acting odd.`
`...That's why they called the manager, Irie.`
`They thought a sedative might help me relax, so I could rest and get better... That's why they carried me up to my room.`
`Mion just wanted to make it fun.`
`She's the kind of person who expresses her goodwill by making a joke out of it.`
`I knew that better than anybody...!!`
`She knew Irie would roll up my shirt to check my heartbeat with a stethoscope.`
` ...So she was just trying to draw graffiti on my shirt just like she did to Tomitake-san as punishment for the game he lost!`
`Yes...`
` That's why Mion`
` took a felt marker out of her pocket.`
`A felt marker.`
`...She brought a marker from home because she just wanted to do something funny.`
`She tried to cheer me up by making me take a punishment for fun rather than nursing me, because that's just what Mion is like... She went to the trouble of bringing a felt marker to my house...`
`Just because she wanted to cheer me up...`
`Rena held me down tightly... and Mion came closer to me... to write something on my shirt...`
`Mion`
` whispered...`
` the words she was going to write...`
` on my shirt!!`
`I heard them.`
` ...I heard them clearly.`
`I heard what she was going to write on my shirt...!!!`
`       I hope`
` you get well soon!`
` Mion`
`I heard them... Then why?!!`
`I should've known she wasn't going to do anything to hurt me!!!`
`Then why? Why?!!`
`Why did the marker look like a syringe to me?!`
`Why did I think that Mion was going to kill me?!?!`
`It was impossible! It was impossible!!!`
`Why? Why? Why?!!`
`Why did I misunderstand that Mion was going to kill me?!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!`
`The numbness in my head receded... and slowly... I felt blood start to run through my entire body again.`
`How long... was I squatting down there...?`
` For a few minutes?`
` Or a lot longer than that...?`
`...As I looked up at the clock, the hands weren't moving at all, as if they had stopped while I had my eyes closed.`
`...Really?`
`The atmosphere in the room wasn't filled with insanity like it was earlier... but it was quiet and gray.`
`Rena wasn't holding me down, Mion wasn't about to give me an injection.`
`...Was all of that... just some kind of illusion?!`
`There was no sense of presence other than myself in that room...`
`It was an extraordinary experience, the kind I'd never had before.`
`...I was there... with Rena and Mion...`
`I doubted my sanity for a moment, but at the same time, I felt some kind of relief too.`
`Ha ha ha... The scary incident was just an... illusion after all.`
`Neither Rena nor Mion would've done such a terrible thing to me...`
`Tears started forming in my eyes.`
`My emotions were running high...`
`Why...?`
`It wasn't a question of why tears were forming in my eyes.`
`Why...?`
`...It was a question... of my sadness.`
`...Why did I feel so sad...?`
` I don't know.`
` ...I don't know...`
`You don't know?`
`What do you mean, you don't know?!!`
` You do know!!`
`I was so stupid. What the hell was I doing?!!`
`I was so pathetic and helpless!!!`
`Mion just tried to cheer me up. That was all.`
`I liked her so much. She was my best friend!`
`She was older than me, but she hung out with me like we were the same age.`
`...She was the first one who came to talk to me in class.`
` She was so nice to me... but I... I...!!!`
`...Mion was lying down in an unnatural position near the window.`
`She was covered in dusky-red blood from her head to her chest.`
`The red fluid splattered on the wall... was Mion's.`
`What had I done...? What had I done...?!`
` I would never forgive myself...!!`
`"I...... truly did ...think of you all as my friends..."`
`Why... Why did all this happen...?`
`There was nothing fun in my life at my old school.`
`...When I talked to anyone, it was only ever about my chances of passing the entrance exam of the schools we wanted to go to.`
` ...My life was shaded in gray.`
`Friends to me were rivals and enemies to vie with for a school recommendation and test scores.`
`My friends here taught me just how unnatural that was.`
`This whole month was a blast...`
`We raised the roof over lunch, our club activities, and the festival...`
`A warm liquid flowed out from my eyes.`
` ...To my surprise, it was... my tears.`
`I didn't have any obligation to cry for them.`
` ...But I couldn't stop it...!!`
`Even though they attempted to kill me.`
`Even though they almost killed me.`
`...I couldn't forget the memories we made during the past month...`
`Or... were those fun days... fake...?`
`Was it an act... that they kept playing perfectly to set me up until today?`
`Was it only me who believed that they were my friends...?`
`It couldn't be...!!!!`
`Rena and Mion... they were my friends for real!`
`Those happy days... couldn't have been just a performance...!!!`
`Rena and Mion must have been forced by somebody to kill me.`
`Or... that an extraordinary existence called Oyashiro-sama possessed them and took over their consciousnesses!`
`No matter what it was... both Rena and Mion... were my best friends!!`
`I was stupid!!!`
`I was such a fool.`
` Such a fool.`
` Such a fool.`
` Such a fool.`
`I wasn't making any sense at all!!`
` I killed my best friends!!!`
`They were my best friends!!`
`Then, why didn't I trust them?!!`
`Why didn't I listen to them?!!`
`I beat them to death. Who did I think I was?!!`
`I made it sound like I didn't do anything wrong!`
`I felt like everybody went crazy except me.`
`I was such a fool! It was the other way around!`
`Of course it was!!`
` I was the only one who went crazy!!!`
`"...K-Kei-chan...?"`
`"I...`
` I...`
` did something terrible...`
` I'll never forgive myself... Ahhhhhhh..."`
`Mion was still alive.`
`...I have a memory of beating her to death because I couldn't trust her. But that's a memory from a nonexistent, different world.`
`But... even though it happened in a different world... I... killed Mion...`
`And I didn't realize how deep that sin was.`
`I even thought until now... that Mion was at fault for being killed!!`
`"Wh-What is wrong with Keiichi-san...?"`
`"I don't know...`
` Kei-chan, please calm down...`
` I'm not dead.`
`You didn't beat me to death. I mean, I'd never let that happen.`
`Okay?"`
`"Quite.`
` There's no one in our club whom you could beat to death, Keiichi-san!"`
`"No... No..."`
`Mion and Satoko looked confused, having no idea why I was crying.`
`But I couldn't help myself.`
`I learned just now that I could earn redemption by confessing my sin.`
`...But I could never earn redemption for this... not from Mion...`
` No matter how much I cried in this world, nobody could give me forgiveness.`
` And so, I could never earn redemption for this sin...`
`Right then, Chie-sensei came in and noticed me crying.`
`...You wouldn't see a teenage boy crying like that very often.`
`Chie-sensei asked me what was going on, but at that moment I couldn't hear anything.`
`Mion and Satoko looked confused. They didn't know how to explain the situation.`
`Rika-chan approached me in the midst of my sobs.`
`"......You remember... don't you, Keiichi...?`
` ...You remember how you...`
`  killed Rena and Mii..."`
`"Yes!!`
` I... killed them!!`
` I killed them!!`
` But I didn't accept my sin. I pretended I was the victim!!`
` I cursed and blamed my friends until the moment I died!!`
` There was blood everywhere... and... and... `
`In the end, I just died alone... without any regrets..."`
`I clawed at my itchy throat in a phone booth.`
` ...I didn't notice my sin,`
` and I died alone...`
`"...Keiichi.`
` ...Did you notice...`
` your sin just now?"`
`"Yes, I did.`
` It took me so long, but I just noticed it!!`
` I remember what I did, not here, but in a different world that looks just like this one!`
` I... killed my friends because I couldn't trust them!! `
`They were just trying to help me!`
` But I didn't listen to them.`
` I don't know why I didn't.`
` Ahhhhhhhhh!!"`
`I didn't care if people were staring.`
`...I just kept crying.`
` I wanted to transmute my sin to tears in order to squeeze it out of me.`
`But the tears that were coming out from my eyes weren't my sin.`
`...They were just tears of regret for doing something irreversible.`
`At that time`
` ...I felt something touching my head.`
`...I opened my eyes, and saw Rika-chan patting my head gently.`
`...I didn't need any comfort.`
`I didn't deserve any comfort from Rika-chan.`
`But the words she spoke to me...`
`weren't ones of comfort.`
`"......I`
` forgive you, Keiichi."`
`".........What......?"`
`"......Keiichi, you noticed your sin.`
` It's a very difficult thing to do, and not something everybody can.`
` Not everyone can understand how great you are, and hence, they can't forgive you.`
` ...But I can, `
`because I know how great you are."`
`".........Rika-chan..."`
`"...This is a miracle.`
` You noticed the sin you committed in another world.`
` That's impossible to do.`
` But you did it.`
` That is the most unbelievable and precious of miracles that could exist in this world..."`
`I didn't understand anything Rika-chan was saying.`
`...But... I felt like she's the only one who understood that impossible memory I had.`
`"...So,`
` you should be able to understand...`
` what Rena Ryuugu is going through right now."`
`"Yes... I understand.`
` She's going through exactly the same thing I went through...!!`
` She wants to trust her friends more than anything!!`
` But she can't!! `
`She's the one who's losing her mind, but she doesn't understand that, and she thinks that the world is going crazy instead!!`
` I don't know how to save her!!`
` I have no idea!!`
` Because... I... failed!! `
`I didn't understand until I died...`
` No, I didn't understand even after I died!!`
` So how can I make Rena realize what I didn't, even after that?!!`
` I can't save her... I can't save her...!! `
`I know, because I was just like her...`
` There's nothing I can do."`
`...Calm down, Keiichi...`
`I did fail.`
`...But that didn't mean Rena would, too...`
`There was no excuse not to save her because I thought she'd fail.`
`...After all, what did Rena do back then?`
`I was totally going mad but... she risked her life to save me!!!`
`In my room, in that world... I had beaten her many times with a metal bat...!`
`But she was smiling.`
`She knew I was scared... and that's why she smiled for me.`
`I beat her so many times. Her arms were broken, and her forehead was cut open...`
`I remembered...`
` Rena didn't block her head...`
` even at the very last moment.`
`She...`
` opened her arms`
` towards me`
` like she was looking for a hug...`
`But I still doubted her...`
` and raised the metal bat up high.`
`Rena told me then.`
` That it was okay.`
`"...Please`
` trust me."`
`Ahhhhhhhhhh!!`
`My friend still told me to believe in her!!`
` She told me to trust her!`
`But I still didn't. I lost it and attacked her!!`
`She was in danger. She was actually killed!!`
`But she didn't even block her head. Instead, she used her arms to reach out for me...!`
`Rena continued to say those words until the moment she died.`
`Trust me.`
` Please`
` trust`
` me.`
`She risked her life to save me!!`
`Until her very last moments... she kept telling me to believe in her...`
`But I didn't listen. For so long, I truly believed that I didn't do anything wrong!!!`
`"...I feel a little bit better now that you've forgiven me, Rika-chan.`
` ...But I still have to atone for my sin.`
` ...I'm going to do that in the same way Rena did for me. I'm going to save her...!"`
`Rena risked her life to save me!!`
`She cared about me until her very last moments!`
`She trusted me!!`
`She believed that her words would reach my heart, so she kept saying them`
` until I cracked her skull!!`
`I don't care if I die...`
`Rena died for me!!`
`I can die for her, too!!`
`I was such a fool for failing to understand my friends' feelings. That's why I didn't understand what she was saying.`
`...But... Rena might be different...!!`
`"...This world is messed up.`
` But it doesn't mean that I can just quit.`
` ...Quitting is the same thing as not believing.`
` I believe in Rena, and in our friendship.`
` ...That's why I can still make it. `
`I can still prevent a tragedy from happening.`
` I can change fate.`
` We will struggle together`
` to seize our future!!"`
`"....................."`
`Rika-chan nodded with a serious look on her face, and she put her hand in the pocket of her skirt.`
`"......Keiichi.`
` ...I won't give up, either.`
`...I'm not going to lose hope in this world.`
` ...I was tired from meeting with countless failures.`
` I gave up on this world as it started to go wrong. `
`That's why...... I kind of gave up on Rena last night.`
` But... I was wrong.`
` ...I realized that the will to fight is such a beautiful and divine thing... and it can work miracles that can even alter the path of fate. `
`So, I'll fight with you.`
` I'll fight again.`
` I'll keep fighting...`
` until I reach the future."`
`"...I have no idea what you two are talking about."`
`"Hee hee...`
` It's normal that you don't remember.`
` ...Keiichi is a special exception."`
`"Huh???`
` I suppose I'm too brilliant to understand what's going on."`
`Rika-chan touched Satoko's forehead to hers.`
`"...But please remember one day.`
` When you're desperately driven into a corner of misfortune, please remember that he risked his life to save you."`
`"Keiichi-san fought for me...?`
` It's hard to believe..."`
`"Hee hee.`
` ...Isn't that right, Keiichi?"`
`Rika-chan looked at me, smiling as if waiting for my agreement.`
`...I wasn't sure if I could risk my life for Satoko...`
`...No, I was sure. I'd risk my life for her.`
`Satoko is my friend.`
`If anybody tried to make her unhappy, I'd beat them up without hesitation.`
`I'd risk my life to save her!`
`...There might even have been a world like that...`
`I nodded to Rika-chan.`
`Rika-chan nodded back to me, looking happy.`
`"...Maebara-kun...... Is everything okay...?"`
`Chie-sensei realized that I'd finally calmed down, and she asked me that.`
`"Yes... everything is fine now.`
` I'm sorry I worried you.`
` ......Anyway... Mion."`
`"...What?`
` What... is it?"`
`I walked towards her.`
`Mion stepped back, not knowing what was going on. She bumped into the blackboard.`
`"What... What is it, Kei-chan...?`
` You look so serious...`
`......Ah..."`
`I held Mion tightly.`
`She still didn't know what was going on, and her face turned red.`
`Crying on her shoulder, I told her the following.`
`"...I'm sorry... I'm so sorry..."`
`"What? What?`
` ...What are you sorry for, Kei-chan...?`
` Th-This ol' man doesn't really get what's going on..."`
`"...It's okay. You don't need to get anything...`
` So just listen to me.`
`...I'm very sorry... And the ohagi you made...`
` They were really good... They were delicious...`
` They cheered me up. `
`...Well... I wanted to tell you that... I would go to school the next day... and the day after that, too. I wanted to tell you that I would see you tomorrow at school... But I couldn't... `
`I'm very sorry that I didn't give you any words of appreciation until today...!!`
` I'll never doubt you, Mion.`
` I'll never doubt any of my friends!!`
` Never, ever again!! `
`So Mion... please forgive me for what I did that day..."`
`Mion must have had no idea what I was talking about.`
`Of course... I didn't, either.`
`...I didn't understand what I was talking about.`
`But my sin wasn't forgiven yet.`
`I needed to confess my sin in order to receive her forgiveness.`
`"I know you risked your life to save me, Mion...`
` So... I'll risk my life to save you too, when you're in some kind of trouble.`
` I promise I will...!!"`
`"...K-Kei-chan............?`
` Aha, haha, you're making me blush......"`
`Mion's face was bright red. She didn't know what was going on.`
`Satoko was blushing too, with a confused look on her face.`
`But Rika-chan and I understood everything.`
`We weren't going to accept a tragedy...!!`
`We couldn't give up just because the world was going out of order!`
`We were going to fight against fate to the very last moment!`
`Mion fought for me.`
` Rena fought for me.`
`That's why... I was going to fight for Rena.`
`Just like she did for me... I was going to risk my life to save her.`
