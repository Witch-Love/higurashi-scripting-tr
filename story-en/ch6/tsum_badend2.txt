`.........There still wasn't any reply from Satoko.`
`Shit......! If we don't find out where Rena's hidden the incendiary device quicklyâ€”!!`
`We've managed to confine her to this space, but finding the device is what's really important.`
`Please.........Satoko, you're the only one we're counting on!!`
`"Ahahahahaha Ahahahahahahahahaha!`
`Awesome, awesome, it's not like we're having club activities or anything, you know?`
` Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`Rena who had thrown Rika-chan aside, swung around to face me as she stood up, her eyes glittering with fury.`
`And then, with an icy jeer enough to make my hairs stand on their ends, she raised her hatchet above her head.`
`"Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaa~!!!`
` I'll smash your head in with a single striiiiiiikeeeeee~!!!!!"`
`Shit......!!`
`Adrenaline gushing through my veins, I twisted my body to barely dodge Rena's attack as the hatchet sliced through the air. `
`The hatchet she had swung recklessly sunk into the wooden floor with a thunderous roar, and Rena retracted it as if it were nothing and held it up once more as she sniggered, flashing her red tongue in mirth.`
`"Goodbye, Keiichi-kun.`
` .........You're free to apologize to me when you have the chance."`
`Fuck.........~!!`
`I wasn't supposed to be wasting my time doing this.`
`If I don't hurry up, ......the explosive device Rena set up is going to...............!!!`
`"Keiichi-saaan, we don't have tiiiimeeeee~!!!"`
`And then, it was immediately after Satoko's desperate scream.`
`Anything and everything in the world before me disappeared into the void.`
`Including, myself...............`
