`Let's say it's a winter month like December right now.`
`What would you do if, all of a sudden, you had a week of hot and humid days with crying cicadas?`
`Would you still wear your coat and scarf?`
`Absolutely not, right?`
`Even though it's still June,`
` it's already summer to us, since we've been having hot days for so long!`
`So, it's totally okay to do this kind of club activity in June!`
`At my school, everybody usually does what they want in PE class, but today would be an exception. All my classmates were gathered in the schoolyard.`
`Mion looked over everybody gathered there, then spoke up loudly.`
`"Hey, everyone! You ready?!"`
`"""Yeah!!!!!"""`
`They all raised the water guns in their hands.`
`It's okay to use water guns in June, because it's been so hot and humid!`
`All my classmates were joining in, so it's gonna be a big water gun battle. I'm so excited!`
`"It is so exciting to do a club activity with everyone from class!"`
`"Yeah!`
` It's going to be so much fun to play outside with everybody together, together!"`
`"......It's going to be fun for them, but we have to be serious, because we can't lose."`
`"Well, yeah! For us club members, every game comes with a risk."`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` Exactly!`
`I look forward to the punishment our more careless members are going to suffer.`
` Good luck, everyone!"`
`"I'm so pumped!!`
` Everybody, listen up. Did you all check your guns?!`
` Are your tanks full?!"`
`"We're all ready, Maebara-san!`
` We're very good at gun battles!"`
`"......Tomita and his friends play with water guns a lot, so they might have an advantage."`
`"Huh huh huh!`
` We're different men today!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun smiled confidently, holding their guns in a practiced manner.`
`Their skills must give them confidence. They even looked different!`
`"As we all know, Mion is going to be a tough opponent, but I think Satoko and Rika-chan could be, too...!`
`What about you, Rena? You can move fast, but you could end up being their target as well, so be careful!!`
` You've been losing a lot of games lately and taking most of the punishments."`
`"Hauu...`
` It's just that the recent games weren't my specialty...`
` B-But, Keiichi-kun, I think you've been losing a lot these days too, haven't you?"`
`"Ha ha ha ha ha!!`
` You have no idea how miserable I was when I had to go home wearing a bra and my mom saw me in it right before I was about to take it off!`
` Gah!!!"`
`"My last punishment was as terrible as yours... I'm ruined for marriage after having to do that!!"`
`Satoko laughed at us loudly while we were shuddering at the memory of the cruel punishments we suffered in the past.`
`"Hooo ho ho ho ho!!`
` You've been low on both luck and spirit!`
`I know why you've been losing so frequently!`
` That's because, you see, you're both losers!!"`
`"Heh heh heh!!`
` She's right. Once you get used to losing, you just can't stop!`
`After all those losses, your fighting spirit fades away.`
` When you can't believe in yourself, nothing goes right, even if you're doing the same thing as everyone else!"`
`"...You!!`
` Haven't you realized that Rena and I took those punishments on purpose because we wanted to spare you that fate?! You should be thanking us, not calling us losers!!!"`
`"Oh, is that so?`
` I'm very sorry for not thanking you enough, then!!"`
`"Ugh!!!`
` Satoko!!`
` You just added oil to the flames of my rage!!`
` I'll make you regret what you just said!!!"`
`"Heh heh heh!!`
` That's the spirit, Kei-chan.`
`This ol' man hopes you can at least last long enough to serve as entertainment.`
`Rena, you too.`
` You'd be embarrassed if you were the first one to get shot.`
` But I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen!`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"I too think Rena-san is going down first!`
` Prepare yourself for a bad time!`
` Oh ho ho!!"`
`"No... Mii-chan, Satoko-chan, you're so mean..."`
`"......Rena and Keiichi, go for it, yayâ˜†."`
`Mion and Satoko laughed at us as loud as they could, then moved on to tease their next target.`
`Left alone, all I could do was stomp on the floor in anger.`
`"Damn it!!`
` I'm going to win! I can't let them laugh at me like that again!!"`
`"Ahahaha, I agree.`
`It feels bad to have them laugh at us like that..."`
`"It's not only how it feels, it's also how they step on my pride!`
` Damn it!"`
`"Like Mii-chan said, it might be true that you can't stop losing once you get used to it.`
`...That's why we have to win today, no matter what, so we can get even!"`
`Rena's eyes looked different.`
`She's usually a funny and weird person, but I know she has the determination to do what she needs to.`
`When Rena looks like this, she can be a tough opponent.`
`"Today, I'll follow the first club rule: I'm going to do everything I can to win."`
`"Oh, you sound determined.`
` You sound cool, but also as if you've been going easy on them before."`
`Rena smiled.`
`Or maybe you could have called it a wicked grin.`
`...She was serious.`
`She was serious about what she said.`
` I could tell that from her expression alone.`
`Among all the club members, Rena is easily the most sensible one.`
`The rule of our club is that we can do anything in order to win, but she's the only one who has moral qualms in doing it.`
`That's why we rarely have a hard time against her, except for when she snaps.`
`It's rare to hear her say that she won't go easy!`
`"Damn it... When you grin like that, you leave me no choice! I have to be super serious about this too!"`
`"I always have to fight with all I have in our club, but I believe there's a time when I have to get super serious about it.`
` I think today is the time!"`
`"Indeed!!"`
` "Yes!!"`
`We pounded our fists together.`
`Usually, when we really don't want to lose the game, one asks the other to work together, but Rena didn't ask this time.`
`Which meant`
` that she was going to try to defeat everybody by herself.`
` No, not 'try.'`
` She was going to`
` 'do'`
` it by herself!`
`Rena looked really cool at that moment, but I wasn't scared.`
`If she was seriously going to 'do' it, I'd have to be serious and do it, too.`
`My fighting spirit had been dented after many losses, but it had begun to burn hot once more!`
`"You look good too, Keiichi-kun.`
` You're even scaring me a little. You look like you're going to defeat everybody all by yourself."`
`"I know that's what you're going to do, too."`
`"That means we're going to fight against each other at the very end."`
`"We would, if we defeated everybody else."`
`"I hope you'll be the last one I have to fight against."`
`"Yeah, me too!!"`
`We pounded our fists together again!`
`"Does everyone remember the rules?`
` You have to call it out when you get hit!`
` Once you're hit, you can't shoot anyone. Even if you did, it wouldn't count!"`
`"Mion, I'd like to confirm the definition of being hit one last time."`
`"When somebody shoots you with a water gun, you're hit.`
`...Heh heh heh, I'll break it down more for you, Kei-chan.`
` You're only hit when it's water from a water gun. `
`In other words, you're not hit when somebody splashes you with a bucket of water."`
`"Only direct shots from a water gun count.`
` I'm sure you're not so scared of Satoko-chan's trap attacks now, huh?"`
`"Ho ho ho!!`
` I will still have many kinds of traps ready for you!`
` Rena-san, you'll be my first target!"`
`"Ahahahahaha, I don't think so.`
` You're not strong enough to take me down yet."`
`"...Wh-What did you just say?!"`
`"Oh-ho!`
` I can't believe Rena gave Satoko tit for tat.`
`This is going to be fun!`
` Heh heh heh!`
` Don't you think so, Kei-chan?"`
`"I don't think so.`
` At least not for you, because all you'll be doing is choosing which of us is going to shoot you first."`
`"......Keiichi seems determined to win."`
`Mion seemed to sense the fighting spirit in me and Rena.`
`...I could tell that she's as serious as we are`
` just from the way she looks.`
`"All right!!`
` I like your spirit!!`
` Are you all ready to start?!`
` Everybody, get to your positions!!`
` The ones you drew by lot earlier!"`
`Everybody had to draw lots to pick a place to start the game from.`
`It wouldn't be fun if everybody was close together at the beginning of the game.`
`By the way, my starting position was behind the school building.`
`...When I drew this starting position, I thought about hiding until there were only a few people left like I did in our last game of tag...`
` But a defensive tactic like that wasn't interesting to me anymore.`
`I hadn't been this excited in a long time...!`
`My legs were shaking with the excitement.`
`It was my first time experiencing that kind of feeling.`
`I could hear Mion's countdown from some distance away.`
`"...Three,`
` two,`
` one..."`
`A single shot of a toy pistol echoed.`
`With that sound, I was already running around the building.`
`There had to be some underclassmen nearby.`
`I'd usually assume that somebody else would take care of them... but this time was different.`
`"Whoaaaarryaaaaahhh!!!"`
`They stood frozen in fear as I ran towards them screaming at the top of my voice.`
`They took a moment to quickly decide whether to fight or to run away, and in that moment, I shot one after another!`
`"Sorry, guys!`
` You just got unlucky with where you started."`
`I felt bad for them because they lost the game so quickly, so I rubbed their heads to cheer them up, and then took their water guns.`
`Yes, that was the key factor in this game.`
`You can't put very much water in a water gun.`
`With ten people around you in a gun battle, the water would be gone in a minute.`
`I abandoned the gun I used to shoot them, held one of their guns in each hand, and scoped out the school yard.`
`Just like I expected, there was an intense battle happening there.`
`In the short time it took me to take care of the area behind the school building, it seems like most of my classmates were already shot.`
`I wasn't surprised, though. I kind of knew it'd happen.`
`You need to have a high skill to fight in the open school yard.`
`Especially when most of the club members were there, it must have been like a battle of elephants and ants!!`
`"...Wh-What is it that Mion is holding...?"`
`Mion was holding a different water gun from the one she had when the game started. She was now holding one that looked like a huge machine gun.`
`Its range capability, its pump-action shooting, and the amount of water it can hold were way beyond comparison.`
`There were no restrictions on what kind of water guns we could use today.`
`As long as it's a water gun, we were allowed to use any kind.`
`Most of us have a normal pistol-style water gun from a local toy store or something similar.`
`I would've bought a bigger one like Mion's if they'd had one.`
`But they weren't in stock, and I'd have to order it in.`
`...In other words, Mion ordered hers a long time ago, just for today.`
`She's always well prepared when it comes to winning.`
`She must've thought that we wouldn't allow her to use the big water gun if she showed it off before the game started, so she must've hidden it somewhere.`
`It looks like most of our classmates were shot right after the game started.`
`Only a few were still alive, trying to survive as long as they could by using the heavy construction equipment as a shield.`
`Mion mercilessly shot at them from various angles to make them come out from behind the shield!`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha!!`
` Stop hiding, cowards!!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were trying their best to resist her attack from behind their shield.`
`It looked like they had no chance against her,`
` but that actually wasn't true.`
`After all, the two of them were only still alive`
`because of all their experience in water gun battles.`
`They survived the first few minutes of her assault, even though 99% of their classmates didn't, and they were still surviving at that very moment...!!`
`Mion, however, is also a battle-hardened soldier.`
`She used the advantage of her big water tank, and gradually but certainly drove them into a corner.`
`It was only a matter of time until she broke them down.`
`"W-We're cornered. It's not fair that she has a machine gun...!"`
`"All we have to do is survive 'til her tank runs low...`
` We don't stand a chance against her when she's shooting at us like this..."`
`They tried to hold out against her, but all they could do for now was to keep running behind cover as Mion strafed closer and closer to them.`
`They wanted to use their two-against-one advantage, but it seemed like they wouldn't even get that chance.`
`If they tried attacking recklessly, one of them might get shot, and then the other would have no chance of winning!`
`So they grew more cautious, placing their bets on their final chance, but that caused their offense to wane.`
`Of course, Mion saw through their plan.`
`She was purposely provoking them so that they'd lose their patience and start attacking her recklessly.`
`Mion circled around the construction equipment, and now she was standing with her back towards me.`
`If I went up against her machine gun fair and square, I wouldn't stand a chance.`
`So... attacking from behind would be the only way for me to defeat her...!`
`Even though she was in a defenseless position... there was some distance between us.`
` I was still too far away!`
` But... it would still be better to attack her now than to take her head-on...!`
`Don't hesitate, Keiichi!!`
` You won't have this chance again!!`
`I stepped out from my hiding place and ran as fast as I could towards her with two water guns in my hands.`
` Instead of approaching slowly and silently, I screamed at the top of my lungs!!`
`"Whooooryaaaaaah!!`
` Mioooooooooooon!!!"`
`"What?!`
`There you are, Kei-chan!!"`
`Mion seemed a little shocked by my surprise attack, but she immediately pulled herself together. She knew the advantages of her weapon.`
`But she didn't shoot me just yet!!`
`She held back, luring me closer.`
`Mion was well aware of how much water she had left.`
`If she had the same kind of water gun as me, we would've had the same range capability.`
` So, it would've been down to our technique to decide the winner.`
`If she was fighting against one of her underclassmen, she could've defeated them easily.`
`Mion immediately calculated her chance of winning against me and figured out that her only chance was to use the advantage of her water gun.`
`She saw the eye of the tiger in me and recalculated her chances of winning in a split second.`
` Really, I can admire how fast she does those things!!`
`I ran at top speed to shorten the distance between us.`
`Our strength should have been equal. I had two water guns with full tanks and she had a machine gun with a half-empty tank.`
`We both waited for the perfect moment!!`
`"Your fighting spirit deserves my respect, Kei-chan.`
` I'm not sure if I would've been a match for you today if I didn't have this gun!!"`
`"I'm disappointed in you, Mion. Your calculations are off today.`
` Did you say you thought you could beat me?`
` ...Because you don't stand a chance!!!"`
`The moment we step within range,`
`Mion and I pulled our triggers at the same time!!`
`Mion set her sight squarely on me while I was trying to shoot and run at the same time. Her shot would obviously be more accurate than mine.`
`My shot of water flew towards nowhere. Mion didn't even need to duck.`
`But Mion's shot made a beautiful arc straight towards my chest.`
`I could see the line of water coming straight at me, but I was too unstable to dodge.`
` Mion had no doubt that she got me!`
`"You need more than spirit to defeat me!!`
` I knew you'd be the first to go down!!"`
`"I'm still disappointed in you, Mion.`
` Your calculations are really off today."`
`"Bullshit!!`
` You can't dodge that shot!!`
` It'll go straight through you, and you'll regret the moment you chose to come at me screaming rather than creeping up from behind!"`
`You're really disappointing me today, Mion.`
` You could've figured it out if you'd spent just one more second to think.`
`You could've figured out the reason why I didn't creep up on you, but screamed as loud as I could instead!!`
`Mion noticed my surprise attack and turned around to face me--in other words, she turned her back on the opponents she was fighting earlier.`
`Those opponents heard my scream and saw that she had turned her back on them...!!`
`"What?! ...What's this?!"`
`Mion noticed her back was wet and cold.`
`She finally understood that the underclassmen she was attacking just earlier had shown their fangs and attacked her from behind!`
`I blocked her water shot with my arm`
`right before it hit my chest!`
`The line of water was broken into droplets and splattered away...!`
`"D-Damn it!`
` I got hit first, so my shot didn't count!!"`
`"You took too long to figure it out!!`
` Now get down, Mion!!"`
`Mion squatted down and covered her head.`
`Now it was me versus Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun!!`
`Their reflexes weren't so bad.`
`They knew well that I'd be their next target after Mion was gone!`
`They didn't feel sorry at all for attacking me right after I just saved them from their predicament.`
` I can respect the cruelty in how quickly they shifted gears.`
`They may one day be able to join our club if they keep refining their sense and skill!!`
`"Our next target is Maebara-san. Let's get him...!"`
`"It's one against two!`
` We can take him...!"`
`They were, however, one step behind me.`
` It was already too late!!`
`For them, Mion was their first target and I was next.`
`But I was different.`
` My first target was them from the start.`
` I didn't even see Mion as my target to begin with...`
` because I knew they'd take care of her!!`
`I was pointing my guns at them long before they moved their sights from Mion to me!!`
`It seemed like they noticed at the last moment that both of my guns had been pointing at them from the beginning.`
`Which meant... it was already too late for them!!`
`"Whoooaaryaaah!!"`
`I jumped over Mion, rolled on the ground, and landed on my feet!!`
`I looked as elegant as an athlete who had just finished a perfect performance.`
`I had a gun in each of my hands.`
` And with those guns, I shot them each in the middle of their chests.`
`"...S-So fast..."`
`"How could the two of us lose against one..."`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun fell to their knees in disappointment.`
`"...I can't believe you did all this, Kei-chan... I guess I'm off today, like you said..."`
`Mion wiped the dirt off her knees, looking frustrated.`
`"Don't worry, it wasn't you."`
`"Then, why did I lose...?"`
`"That's simple."`
`I twirled my guns on the tips of my fingers.`
`"I have to win sometimes in order to keep looking so cool!"`
`There were only a few people left alive.`
`...Rena, Satoko, and myself.`
`Rena and Satoko were fighting fiercely.`
`Were they evenly matched?`
` No, Satoko was pushing her hard.`
` Moving fast, she was driving Rena into a corner.`
`Rena was usually gentle and slow, but today she was different.`
`She was very serious today and yet...`
`Satoko was still overwhelming her. She's a tough customer even without her tricky traps...!`
`"Ho ho ho ho!!`
` Do you remember threatening me earlier? I suppose you were just bluffing!"`
`"You move well...!`
` But I'm still going to win!"`
`Satoko kept moving around, piling on pressure in order to pin Rena down.`
`She kept shooting, so her tank must have almost been empty... but her shots were still sharp and fast.`
`I noticed a bucket near her feet, which was full of many water guns.`
`I understood, seeing that. She had been taking guns from others who were already out of the game!`
`In this battle, reloading bullets (water) was more crucial than the actual shooting.`
`The hole that you put water into on these guns is rather small.`
` To put water through it from a faucet takes time and requires a certain amount of skill.`
` In a battle like this, it would almost be suicidal.`
`I understand that well, so I'd been taking guns from the people I defeated. But I could only hold one in each hand.`
`Satoko used a bucket to overcome the limit...!`
`Rena looked like she had only one water gun.`
`I'd assume she had two earlier,`
` but she must've used a lot of water during her long battle with Satoko.`
`It looked like she was trying to save her water for the right moment, but with Satoko's fierce attacks, it was obvious that it was only a matter of time before Rena was driven into a corner.`
`However, Rena is also quite skilled.`
`She only pretended to be driven into a corner, but she was actually luring Satoko to a place where she'd have the advantage.`
`There was a narrow, twisting path near the gymnasium warehouse behind the school building.`
`With Rena's water levels running low, she'd want to turn things around with a single, close-range shot.`
` That narrow path was a perfect place for her to do that.`
`"What's wrong?`
` You're slowing down a little.`
` Getting tired?"`
`"Oh ho ho!`
` I appreciate your concern, but I'm not tired at all!`
` I think you should worry more about your remaining water.`
` You haven't shot back at me for a while.`
` Your tank is empty, I suppose?"`
`"If you think so, why don't you stop hiding and show your face?"`
`"I will pass.`
` I'm aware you've been holding onto your last shot."`
`"One shot is all I need.`
` I'll be nice and shoot you in the forehead. I don't want you to get your clothes wet, after all!"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` I never imagined I could have such a thrilling battle with you, Rena-san!`
` However, with the amount of water you have remaining, I doubt you have enough pressure to make that last shot go far."`
`Satoko was right about that.`
`Rena had just enough water to make one last shot.`
`As the amount of water left in the tank dwindles, the range of shots you can make shortens.`
`That makes the last shot the shortest and weakest of them all!`
`Regardless of her absolutely disadvantageous situation, Rena didn't look frustrated.`
`I could tell she had no intention to lose.`
` It was almost like she didn't even see Satoko as a threat!`
`"You picked a perfect location for yourself, did you not?`
` I have to tread cautiously."`
`Satoko seemed to understand how dangerous Rena's last shot was going to be better than I did, since she was the one actually fighting against her.`
`"I don't play chess very often, but I believe this kind of situation is called a stalemate, is it not?"`
`Satoko took out another gun with a full tank and shortened the distance between them slowly and carefully.`
`A gun with a full tank doesn't only have a long range.`
`It also has enough power to make shots more accurate.`
`If they shot at each other in a frontal attack, Satoko would have a 99% chance to win...!`
`Even so, Satoko was still afraid of Rena's last shot.`
`Satoko shortened the distance even further, smiling as if unafraid, but I could tell she was actually full of fear.`
`...Satoko compared this situation to chess earlier, but it wasn't exactly the same.`
`In chess, you can use some pieces to drive the opponent's king into a corner, but in this case, there were only Rena and Satoko.`
`You can lose some of your pieces in order to achieve a win, but Satoko doesn't have any pieces other than herself.`
`A king can't drive the other king into a corner alone! That's called a stalemate!`
`That's why while at first glance it looks like Satoko has the absolute advantage, they're actually on equal footing!!`
`"Let us finish this. It's not like us to wait for the bell to bring an end to this battle!!"`
`"You're right.`
` Let's do this!!!"`
`That's strange, I thought. Rena wouldn't have to move just on a dare from Satoko.`
`What kind of plan did she have?!`
`Rena had been hiding behind cover for a while, but she came out without hesitation!!`
`I noticed something right away.`
` Rena had a different gun!`
`Satoko seemed to notice it as well.`
`"I had a plan to hide here when my water ran low.`
` I hid a gun in advance."`
`Damn! She's good!!`
`In using a trap at the last moment for a come-from-behind victory, it was as though she was taking Satoko's best skill from her and firing it right back!!`
`Satoko no longer had any advantages now that both of them were pointing their guns at each other with full tanks.`
`But she still looked confident.`
`What was going on? Did she have some kind of plan, too?!`
`"That gun you're holding right now is very important to me."`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`"You would've kept waiting for your perfect shot and wouldn't have come out of hiding if you didn't have that gun."`
`At that moment, lightning ran through my brain and I instantly understood the situation!!`
`Of course!!!`
`Rena was in a disadvantageous situation earlier, but it was actually the same for Satoko, since she didn't have a chance to make her shot while Rena was in hiding.`
`Rena had remained cautious in order to hit with her last shot, and that made it difficult for Satoko to attack her.`
`However, what if,`
` Rena didn't need to take`
` "the last shot for a come-from-behind victory"?!`
`No, I said it wrong.`
` What if Rena got a new gun with a full tank?!`
` She'd stop hiding and come out to fight against Satoko!!`
`"You see, I knew from the beginning that you'd run over here in order to obtain that gun..."`
`Let Satoko talk crap, Rena.`
`You don't have to listen to her. Just shoot her right now!`
`Rena thought the same thing.`
` She shot at Satoko without any hesitation!`
`...But, she frowned in confusion a moment after...!`
`What was going on?! ...She couldn't shoot?!`
` Was her water gun broken?`
`Or did somebody break it?!`
`"Didn't you know that you can easily break a water gun by putting a little bit of sand in an empty tank and pulling the trigger several times?`
` Ho ho ho ho!!"`
`"...You knew I was hiding my trump card here and pulled a cheap trick like that, huh...?"`
`"I told you.`
` You only set one small trap at the last moment.`
` That is the beauty of traps!!"`
`When it comes to traps, Satoko remained a notch above Rena after all...!!`
` I couldn't believe Satoko figured out Rena's plan in advance and set a trap to counter it...!`
`Rena, you made a big mistake...!`
` You should've kept the old gun with you. You could've at least made that last shot.`
`But it's too late now for you to pick it up again...!`
`Rena was in a worse situation than she was before.`
`She couldn't even take another shot...!!`
`"Be prepared.`
` You told me earlier that you'd shoot me in the forehead, did you not?`
` Well, I will be at least kind enough to do you the same favor...!!!"`
`Satoko slowly narrowed her distance again and pointed the muzzle at Rena's forehead!`
`Rena still didn't look like she'd given up.`
` She still thought the game was undecided.`
`"...Satoko-chan, you're not as good as you think you are."`
`"...Wh-What did you say?"`
`"If you got me with your trap, it'd be your right as the winner to allow yourself the room to breathe and smile like you're doing right now.`
`But all you've done is drive me into a tough spot. You haven't killed me yet.`
` Don't you think it's a little too early for you to act like you've already got me?"`
`"Ho ho ho ho!`
` I thought you were going to say something much scarier than that.`
` It makes no difference, because I'm going to get you right now."`
`"If I were you, I'd just shoot rather than keep talking.`
` You know why? Because if I didn't, I'd lose."`
`"Lose?`
` Are you talking about me?`
` I highly doubt you can fight with a jammed water gun."`
`"Do you remember the rule?`
` You're hit when it's water from a water gun."`
`"Huh?`
` So what are you saying?"`
`When I heard her saying that, I started running!!`
`My target was Rena.`
`Satoko was already dead to me.`
`Why? ...She was going to be shot by Rena within the second!!`
`"I have absolutely no idea what you're referring to, Rena-san.`
` What do you think you can do with a jammed water gun?"`
`"As long as I have water in my gun, I can still fight.`
`Don't you get it yet?!!"`
`Rena raised her broken water gun up high and smashed its handle on the wall of the school building as hard as she could!`
`The plastic broke easily and water flowed out of it...!!`
`"As long as the water from the gun hits you, you're dead.`
`It doesn't matter where the water comes out."`
`Rena was right. She just saved herself by thinking it through.`
`If she was using a real gun, bullets would only come out from one end of the gun.`
`But this was a water gun.`
`She could make her bullets, water in this case, come out from any place, not just the barrel of the gun...!!`
`"...Wha?!!!!"`
`Satoko finally realized that she was standing defenselessly in front of Rena.`
`Satoko's trap was successful.`
` But she overestimated its effect!!`
`She should've just shot Rena without hesitation before Rena noticed her new water gun was jammed!!`
` She was going to fail because she had grown overconfident of her victory!!`
`A second before Satoko pulled the trigger,`
` Rena swung her water gun as if slashing Satoko with a sword!!`
`Satoko fired her bullets, but it was too late.`
`A second before Rena would be shot down, a blade of water hit Satoko in the face.`
` No, not hit. It cut her face open...!!`
`"Your endgame wasn't good enough...!!!"`
`"I can't believe... I lost...!!"`
`Rena ran towards Satoko, who was standing still in shock, and took her water gun.`
`Rena knew I was her last target and that I was running towards her.`
`"Renaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`Rena, using her superior mobility, began to duck and weave.`
`We were evenly matched.`
`Neither of us neglected to make any effort possible to take advantage of the situation.`
`"I knew it'd end up being a one-on-one battle with you.`
` I knew you wouldn't disappoint me...!"`
`"I'm seeing you in a new light today. I didn't know you had the guts!!"`
`"Rather than a new light, I'd like you to see me in a romantic way!"`
`"I can try if you let me win!"`
`"No thanks!!!"`
`We circled around the construction equipment, trying to take shots at each other.`
`We were both sweating like crazy.`
`But I didn't feel tired.`
` Big drops of sweat tickled as they ran down my body.`
`Rapid bursts of water flew across both of our paths.`
`Neither of us had the advantage or disadvantage.`
`I didn't feel elated that I might win or frustrated that I might lose.`
`I was just enjoying this battle with Rena.`
`It was like a dance.`
`A dance that I couldn't dance alone.`
`A dance that I could only dance with an opponent...!!`
`"Rena sure is sharp when she gets serious...`
` It's giving me chills!"`
`"Keiichi-san is good, too. He's evenly matched with her...!!"`
`"......I can't tell who's going to win."`
`In fact, none of the observers could tell who was going to win.`
`Neither could we.`
`We had no idea who was going to win.`
` We had no idea when this battle would end...!`
`I didn't know why, but it was great fun just to fight against Rena, and I didn't even care whether I won or lost. In fact, I never even wanted it to end.`
`As we fired at each other, both of our tanks emptied, shortening our range.`
`Inevitably, it became more and more like a melee than a gun battle.`
`We fired our water guns as if trying to cut each other with blades of water, swinging the gun like a sword.`
`We both came up with the idea to swing the gun hard to generate centrifugal force, in order to increase the range of our attacks.`
`I dived to duck her shot.`
` I rolled on the ground and landed on my feet!`
` I ducked her shot again`
` and swung my gun like a sword!!`
`Who could've imagined that our club's water gun battle would turn into one-on-one close combat like this?`
` Absolutely nobody...!`
`"Ahahahahaha!"`
`"Oh, you think so too, Rena?"`
`"You too, Keiichi-kun?"`
`We're both breathing hard, calculating the timing needed to take a closer step.`
`And then, we both grinned wickedly at each other.`
`"This is so fun!`
` I don't want it to ever end!!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Don't hate me if you lose!!"`
`"No, never!!`
` I'd hate myself for ending this game!!`
` But I know I won't be the one crying in the end!!"`
`"I don't know about that!`
` Your feet are getting weak, like they're made of straw!!"`
`"Shut uuuup!!`
`Whoaaaryaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"...Wow.`
` ...They both look so cool...!"`
`"Maebara-san, go!!"`
`"Ryuugu-san, you can get him!!"`
`I became relaxed enough to enjoy the battle, and finally realized that many of our classmates were watching our one-on-one fight.`
`I barely had any water left.`
`I would have to make the next shot count, or I was done for.`
`It seemed like Rena was in the same situation, too.`
`"...The next shot will decide it.`
` I wish we could fill up our tanks and keep doing this forever."`
`"Well, people enjoy things because they end eventually.`
` Flowers are beautiful especially because they wither."`
`"I see. That's one way to look at it!!"`
`"It's been fun fighting against you.`
` But this is it!"`
`"Indeed!!`
` Sorry, but I'm going to end this battle!!"`
`"Good luck, Keiichi-kun!!"`
`"Don't cry when you lose!!"`
`"Let's do this!!!"`
`"Hell yeah!!`
` Whoaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"...W-Wow..."`
`"W-Which one of them won...?!"`
`The cries of the cicadas echoed in the quiet school yard. They sounded like the hand of a watch ticking away the seconds.`
`Neither one of us moved.`
`...We took our final shots and now stood motionless... It looked like one of those duels in Western movies.`
`"...Who hit the other first...?"`
`"...I don't know. I couldn't see it..."`
`Our classmates broke the silence first.`
`They finally realized that our intensely beautiful one-on-one battle was over...`
`"C-Class prez, what is your decision...?!"`
`Mion, in turn, realized that she had to deliver a verdict to end the game.`
`But she was just as stunned as the others and it took her a moment to recover.`
`...Mion was taking time to render her verdict.`
`In fact, Rena and I didn't know who won either.`
`My last shot flew fast and splashed sideways as if a blade had cut her chest.`
`I knew that for sure.`
`But at the same moment, Rena's shot hit me in the shoulder.`
`...Whoever shot the other first wins.`
`But we didn't know if it was me or her.`
`That's why we stood motionless, waiting for the verdict to be delivered...`
`"...Did you see it, Rika...?"`
`"......I can't tell..."`
`"Class prez... who won...?"`
`Everybody held their breath, waiting for Mion to call it...`
`Rena and I kept staring at each other.`
`The spectators were the only ones who were interested in who the winner was... To us, it wasn't that important.`
`We had a great battle. We had both really wanted to do better than the other.`
`We both wanted to call it a tie.`
`For this great battle, settling for a tie would be the best and most proper option.`
`In other words... this one-on-one fight wasn't a battle to decide the winner...`
`It seems like everybody is thinking the same way.`
`"......Mii?"`
`"...Yeah..."`
`"......They can't move if you don't deliver a verdict."`
`"...Ah... yeah..."`
`Mion hates to settle for a tie because she loves to draw a line between superiors and inferiors.`
`She tends to settle for a tie when deciding who is the loser because it's more fun to have as many people as possible suffer the punishment... But she's never settled for a tie between winners before.`
`Mion holds a special feeling towards the meaning of being number one.`
`Everybody continued holding their breath, awaiting her verdict.`
`...Please make it a tie...`
`Everybody wished for that in their hearts.`
`Mion was hesitating to make the decision.`
`She could've chosen a winner more easily if one of us did even a little bit better than the other.`
`...But even if one of us did a little better than the other, I feel like nothing fits better than settling for a tie.`
`"The two of you did... great today."`
`Mion finally started speaking.`
`"...Kei-chan and Rena, you showed us significant spirit and skill today.`
` The explosive power you showed us was so beautiful that it's beyond even the highest praise I can ever give. `
`...It's very difficult for me to decide who the winner should be after watching such an amazing battle."`
`"Th-Then... you mean we have two winners...?"`
`"...I don't like to have two winners. That's not really the point of our club.`
`...However, they were both so good that it's very hard for me to decide who was better...`
`So!!`
` I'm going to call it a tie for today.`
` And they'll have another battle some other time to decide the winner!!"`
`I expected she might settle for a tie,`
`but I never thought she'd make us have another battle!`
`"Maebara-san, you were awesome!!!`
` You were so cool!!"`
`"Ryuugu-san, you gave me chills!!`
` It was like, you know?`
` You set our hearts on fire!!"`
`The classmates rushed towards us and praised us for showing them something that cool.`
`Rena and I were finally released from the tension of battle and dropped to our knees.`
`"Too bad.`
` We tied."`
`"Yeah.`
` I can't wait for our next battle."`
`"Can you give me your hand?"`
`"Of course.`
` I was going to ask you the same thing."`
`We both smiled at each other.`
`It was the first time we ever hit it off like this.`
`"That aside..."`
`"She's pulled a fast one, hasn't she."`
`"......??`
` What do you mean?"`
`"Mii-chan's trying to get away without suffering the punishment while we're distracted!"`
`"...Ah..."`
`"She was just trying to sound cool, but the main reason she delivered that verdict was to protect herself."`
`"Yeah. Hey!"`
`"She's running away! ...Looks like my guess was right... She's so obvious..."`
`The bell rang, a sign that class was over, while we all laughed at Mion.`
`After that...`
`"......Good job out there, you two.`
` Here, use this towel."`
`"....................."`
`Rika-chan held out a towel, a big smile on her face.`
`However, Rena and I stepped back and pointed our water guns at her.`
`"......Meep.`
` ...I was already shot many times.`
` I told everybody I was already hit, but nobody believed me."`
`Rika-chan was soaking wet.`
`...Well...`
`Nobody believed her because she really could be that sneaky, pretending that she was hit in order to stay in the game.`
`"It's your own fault that nobody believes you.`
` Sometimes it's hard to believe anything you say."`
`"......Meeeep.`
` ...Everybody is so mean to me.`
` I feel lonely.`
` ...I'm lonely like a poor kitten crying in a cardboard box because nobody wants her.`
` Meep-meep..."`
`Boom!`
` The sound came from Rena's head.`
` I saw a circle of smoke coming out of it.`
`...Rena must have pictured Rika-chan meowing like a cat in a cardboard box.`
`"Hauuuuuuuu!!!`
`Rika-chan is an abandoned kitten, kitten. I'm taking her home with me!!!"`
`Aw!`
` Ugh!`
` Ouch!`
` Meep-meep!`
` Mmm...`
` Boom!!`
`Rena, you're ruining how cool we looked earlier!`
`Rena was back to her normal self, and jumped on Rika-chan like a chameleon capturing its prey.`
`Rika-chan struggles to get away.`
`"Come on, everyone! Get back to your classroom now!!"`
`Chie-sensei clapped her hands and yelled at us from the window of the teacher's office.`
`"Let's go!"`
`Everyone exchanged smiles and ran back to the classroom.`
