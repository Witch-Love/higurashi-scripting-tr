`Everybody started shouting, clapping their hands, and whistling for joy.`
`...I don't blame them.`
`They came here just for the event at Angel Mort.`
`None of them expected to see the waitresses wearing different costumes like this.`
`"......Meep."`
`"HAUUUUuUUuuUuuUuu!!!`
` R-R-R-Rika-chaaan!!`
` I'm taking you home with me!!!"`
`"Wait. Calm down, Rena.`
` You can't take her home yet. She has to finish her punishment first."`
`Rika-chan appears with glasses of water and wet napkins on a tray.`
`They drew lots to decide on the costumes. Rika-chan's costume is the uniform of Angel Mort, which we use regularly for punishments.`
`"......Hello.`
` Welcome to Angel Mort."`
` Rika-chan put the glasses of water and the wet napkins in front of Rena and me.`
`"HauAuauuu!!`
` You look so adorable.`
` I'm taking you home with me!!"`
`Rena raised her weird voice, and everybody in the store followed suit.`
`"""I-I-I'm taking her home with me!!"""`
`Everybody started shouting the phrase!`
`Before I knew it, they were surrounding our table trying to burn the scene of Rika-chan serving customers into their minds.`
`"Hauuuu,`
` Rika-chan,`
` you look great in that uniform!!`
` Hauuuuu!!"`
`"......Meep.`
` ...It's embarrassing to have everybody look at me like that."`
`"Hm?`
` There's something different about the uniform, though."`
`"G-G-G-Good eyes, Maebara-san!!`
` Allow me to explain!!"`
`Tomita-kun, our underclassman, pushed his way through the crowd.`
`"Oh, Tomita-kun.`
` Okamura-kun, too.`
` I didn't know you guys had a ticket."`
`"That's not important right now, Maebara-san!`
` The important thing here is the uniform Furude-san is wearing today. `
`As you already know, the uniforms of Angel Mort are designed to bring out the most of a mature woman's features.`
` Therefore, it's normally required to have certain bodily proportions to wear this uniform.`
`In that sense, this is the least compatible uniform for Furude-san, because she's still at an early stage of development."`
`"Plus, the other problem was that the restaurant couldn't find a uniform in Furude-san's size! `
`That's why it was necessary to try various measures in order to facilitate her punishment, that is, to wear the uniform of Angel Mort!! `
`Therefore, they came up with the idea to use a school swimsuit, and it created an impossible combination of said swimsuit and the uniform of Angel Mort!!`
` It's so eccentric that even God couldn't see it coming!!`
`In this costume, Furude-san now has an overwhelming attack power far beyond her normal statistics! `
`She also gained elemental enchantment,`
` status impairment,`
` a huge increase to her critical hit rate,`
` and on top of that, she's also given increased invincibility time during powerups!!`
`Do you understand how great this is?!`
` You do, don't you?!`
`Let me put it another way, like what Ryuugu-san always says.`
` I`
`-I`
`-I`
`-I`
`-I'm taking her home with me!!!"`
`"No, you can't! I'm the one who's taking her home!!`
` But, I understand exactly how you feel, I'm taking her home with me!!!"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun held Rena's shoulders, and they shouted the phrase in their excitement!`
`The phrase had spread throughout the entire store, and was now out of control.`
`...Anyway, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun surprised me sometimes.`
`For their age, they're so good at giving passionate speeches... They'll probably make it big in the future...!!`
`"Where are Mii-chan and Satoko-chan??`
` I can't wait to see them!!"`
`At that time, the crowd sent up another roar.`
`I hear Mion telling them to let her through.`
`...I don't remember what kind of costume she picked.`
`"K-saaaaaaan!!`
`What,`
` what,`
` what's going on?!!"`
`"Wow!!`
` K-Kameda-kun...!`
` Of course, you're here because this is a Dessert Festa, and you're a dessert maniac...`
` Hey, how have you been doing...?"`
`"It doesn't matter how I am!!`
` More importantly, what is that?!! What's going on here?"`
`Kameda-kun was in a state of great excitement. Thick veins were displaying on his forehead.`
`...The source of that excitement appears through the crowd.`
`"There's no turning back. I guess I've got to do what I've got to do.`
` Welcome to Angel Mort!`
` Here is your ultra-rare cheese cake!"`
`Mion appeared with a cake on a tray...`
` Oh!!`
` Now I remember what she picked for her costume...!!`
`"Hauuuuuu!!!`
` Mii-chan, you look so kyute too!!!"`
`"I can't believe I'm doing this!`
` I was going to make Kei-chan wear it!"`
`"...M-Maebara-san,`
` this costume is extraordinary, too!!`
`Plus,`
` because you know her in person, and because she's the leader of the club who has never lost any games in the past and also a class president who's always perfect at everything,`
` you can enjoy this 500%!!`
`Even the class president, who doesn't know what losing is, can't escape the punishment...`
` Your club is`
` so terrifying!!"`
`"Wha-Wha-What?!!`
` Please explain what is going on here, K!!!`
` I thought we were friends because we shared a huge parfait together!!`
` How could you not tell me about such a wonderful club!!! `
`I can't believe you didn't tell me about this.`
` If I knew about it, I wouldn't have joined the baseball team!`
` Where is the reset button for my life?!"`
`The crowd roars in excitement!`
`"What a great club!!"`
`"I've never heard of a club as wonderful as this in my life!!"`
`"Hauu... You can't join our club. Only people who live in Hinamizawa can join~~☆."`
`"""Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!!!"""`
`"Then, I have to move my certificate of residence to Hinamizawa at once!!"`
`Stop there, Rena.`
`The population of Hinamizawa might double by tomorrow...`
`"Anyway... this is a beautiful punishment, K...!!`
` Costumes that make women look beautiful are like decorations on desserts!`
` A shortcake, for example,`
` is just a sponge cake if you take away its decoration!! `
`But, if you decorate it with whipped cream,`
` to enjoy the wonderful and mysterious harmony that layers and layers of beautiful decoration create...`
` You can enjoy it with both your eyes and your tongue.`
` Ohhhhhh☆!! `
`That's why this combination of a sailor-style school uniform and gym shorts is wonderful!!`
`They're both ordinary school clothes, and each is tasteful in its own right. But let's put that aside for now! `
`A school uniform and gym clothes are in the same category, namely school clothes, but they've never been combined together. It's just like a strawberry daifuku!! `
`Nobody thought they'd taste good together.`
` But, the combination actually brought an unexplored and unknown taste to this world!!"`
`"...Kei-chan, he's calling you 'K'.`
` I didn't know you were friends with this pervert."`
`"I'm trying my best not to be friends with him..."`
