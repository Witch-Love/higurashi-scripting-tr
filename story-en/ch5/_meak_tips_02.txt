`Satoko was crying while hiding behind my back.`
`She's been crying while clinging onto me, so my back was wet with her tears and snot.`
`My aunt had been screaming hysterically, but she looked tired now.`
`...I suddenly realized that it was already past one in the morning.`
` She vomited out a series of screams one last time, then finally called it quits.`
`Satoko seemed exhausted. She was looking down in a state of shock.`
`Even after my aunt walked away, she didn't realize she had been freed.`
`So, I stroked her head and told her...`
`"......It's over,`
` Satoko."`
`Satoko twitched.`
`Her eyes grew bright again, and tears rolled down her cheeks.`
`...She looked up at my face.`
`".................."`
`She knew it was over...`
` but wanted to hear it directly from me. She begged me with a look.`
`...To be honest, I was really exhausted, too.`
`So I felt a bit annoyed when she tried to make me say it.`
`But I needed to pacify her...`
` so I gently told her what she wanted to hear.`
`"......She's done with her scolding...`
` So let's go to sleep,`
` all right?"`
`Satoko clung to me while her tears continued to fall.`
`She was crying again silently...`
`Satoko was shivering pitifully.`
`...Her small back reminded me that there was nobody else to protect her.`
`"Here...`
` Go brush your teeth, make your bed...`
` and go to sleep..."`
`Satoko smiled faintly and nodded.`
`I felt dizzy.`
`...As I was released from the strain, a harsh drowsiness fell upon me.`
`While Satoko was washing her face, I went to the toilet.`
`I zoned out while watching my pee.`
`In my dizziness, I almost missed the shot.`
`...I felt like I was being sucked into the toilet.`
`...I couldn't even remember what caused it...`
`Why did my aunt start screaming today......?`
