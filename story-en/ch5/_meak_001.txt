`...Seven keys were attached to the key chain.`
`Without knowing which key was the correct one, I had to go by instinct and try every key, one by one.`
`On average, I'd reach the correct key within 3.5 attempts.`
`I'd be fortunate if I could open the lock within the first three keys...`
`And I'd be unfortunate if I didn't.`
`I had to think of the worst-case scenario: getting the right key only on the very last attempt.`
`I fought with my nervousness. My head ached from it.`
`I put the key in, and turned it.`
`I just needed to repeat that small procedure several more times, but...... I couldn't stop shaking.`
`...Damn...`
` Even a three-year-old kid can do something this easy.`
`...So, am I more childish than a three-year-old?`
`Whatever. I don't care if I'm clumsy.`
`...I just need to try all these keys...`
`...Even in the worst-case scenario, the lock will open on the seventh try...`
`"......`
`............No way..."`
`...Reality isn't always the same as math.`
`What happened was worse than my worst-case scenario... None of the keys worked at all.`
`I could feel the blood draining from my brain.`
`...Did I get the wrong set of keys?!`
`No. I definitely see a faint marking that says this set is for this door.`
`...Am I just reading it wrong?`
`Should I go back to the key cabinet to look for the right one...?`
`That would mean a great loss of time.`
`Just by being here I'm already risking so much.`
`...Something that could ruin everything might happen any moment...`
`If I can't open this lock, do I have to go back to the administration office?`
`...If there were no other choice, it'd be a waste of time to spend another second here...!`
`The administration office wouldn't necessarily be empty at this time.`
`...Somebody might come in.`
`I won't be able to look for the right key if that happens...!!`
`...I stood up quickly, as if electrified.`
`I was almost in a panic, and so felt the urge to move...`
`My instinct pushed me.`
`I have to go back there as quickly as possible...!!`
`It's dangerous to be here, and it's also dangerous if somebody comes into the administration office!`
`...I cooled my head,`
` making it as chilly as possible,`
` to repress my fear...`
`Calm down, Shion...`
`...Mion wouldn't panic in this situation...`
`Maybe I'm just mistaken...`
`Why don't I try the keys`
` one more time...?`
`The next moment, I felt a faint vibration in the air. Somebody was walking somewhere in the hallway.`
`If it were a normal situation, I would've known I wouldn't run into them, since the footsteps were very far away.`
`...But at the time, I couldn't think calmly.`
`Ah... shit...`
`Why am I panicking this much just because of footsteps...?`
`Calm down... calm down...`
`I should be feeling excited instead.`
`...Calm down, calm down.`
`...I just need to do what I have to do.`
`I should ignore the footsteps, because they're not an immediate threat...`
`...Pretend they aren't there...!`
`I have to listen for something much more important right now...!`
`Ah... shit...`
`This key should be hard and cold, but...`
` it's pliable and hot...`
` it feels like rubber...`
`How could I stick this into the keyhole?`
`Shit, shit, shit...!`
`It wasn't the key that was pliable.`
`...It's my fingers that were limp.`
`...Ah... shit, shit, shit...!`
`The key sprung out of my hand and fell to the floor.`
`It shouldn't have made any sound`
` because it was so pliable, but...`
` it made a tremendous metal noise as if somebody pushed over a cupboard.`
`Cliiinnng!!!`
` The sound almost stopped my heart.`
`I felt dizzy for a while.`
`I looked around afterwards to carefully see if I caused any disturbance to the surroundings.`
`Calm down, calm down...`
`Nothing's changed.`
` I don't hear anything...`
` So... am I safe?`
`Calm down... calm down, calm down...`
`Wait... I don't hear anything?`
`What about those footsteps in the distance?`
`Calm down, calm down, calm down...!`
`Are they looking for me after they noticed the sound...?`
`Ah, shit... What is that sound I'm hearing? Is it my sweat dripping on the floor?`
`......Shut up, shut up, shut up...!`
`How could I hear the sound of my sweat?`
` Calm down,`
` calm down, calm down...`
` Calm the fuck down...!!!`
`I have to clarify.`
` This isn't a prison or a detention center.`
`It's a private school.`
`Not a normal one, though.`
`It costs a fortune just to get in.`
` It's a boarding school that provides education from elementary school to university.`
`Being for girls only, rather than a school, you could say it's a factory that manufactures 'ladies.'`
`Some of my classmates here have never even used public transportation.`
`...Really, it isn't normal.`
`To me, saying "how nice to see you" instead of just "hi" is already insane,`
` and calling the teachers "sisters" gives me the creeps.`
`I hate the morning and evening prayers, to say nothing of the Sunday mass.`
`I don't want to memorize the Bible passages, and the Holy Ghost gives me a rash.`
`If I stayed in this institution (that's what I call the place) for many years, I'd either go crazy or be brainwashed.`
`Most of the girls choose to be brainwashed, but...`
` I can't do that.`
`...After all, I was more impressed by the political schemes and international trade behind religious propagation than by the love of God which the Bible teaches.`
`Because of that, I'd been treated as a problematic child from the beginning.`
`...I experienced lots of disadvantages as a result.`
`I realized that quickly, so I superficially pretended to be normal.`
`However, I got tired of acting, so I started to reveal my true self from time to time.`
`I became a problematic child once again.`
`People started to treat me differently once again.`
`It's fun to misbehave.`
`...But it wouldn't do anything for me in the long run.`
`...So, why did I act that way?`
`Why, even though I knew it was going to backfire on me later on?`
`......After examining my emotions, I realized that I'd completely had it with my surroundings.`
`I was afraid of being brainwashed in this institution.`
`I can't live here.`
`I won't let them brainwash me!`
`Six months ago, I decided to escape this place.`
`The moment I made up my mind, I started to feel alive again.`
`I acted ladylike in order to deceive the sisters.`
`Pretending became fun once I'd set my goal.`
`It gave me the creeps when they told me with smiles that it was God's influence that I started to behave religiously.`
`I laughed at them behind their backs.`
`I took on my classmates' duties in order to understand the layout of the school, and the schedules of the staff and guards.`
`...I soon found out that the security of the school was immensely tight, because there were many daughters of important people living there.`
`The guards walked their beat randomly. There were surveillance cameras everywhere.`
`The system that kept out intruders ironically also worked to prevent escapees.`
`But... that excited me instead.`
`I simulated how to avoid all the surveillance in my head many times.`
`I drew an escape route in the corner of my notes during class and tested if it worked.`
`I strove to acquire any necessary skills for the escape.`
`It was all fun.`
`...After all, the situation was cathartic for me.`
`That's who I am.`
`No matter how hard they tried to brainwash me, I'd never change.`
`I'd been waiting for the moment of my escape, preparing physically and mentally.`
`First,`
` I needed the courage to escape.`
`I had to be confident of the plan.`
`I had to think deeply about it.`
`I also needed skills and physical strength.`
`...I imagined all the possible obstacles and trained myself.`
`(It was funny because I was finally able to enjoy gym classes,`
` even the long-distance runs.)`
`I needed a perfect plan, as well as the physical strength and skills necessary to execute it.`
`Also, supported by those things, I needed determination.`
`I made sure that I had all I needed, and executed the plan.`
`I decided to plant a seed in school before the appointed day.`
`The seed was a rumor that one of the male teachers was having a relationship with a student.`
`I won't go into the details now, but that can turn into an enormous problem in this school.`
`......The school is limited to girls precisely because their parents want to avoid those kind of problems.`
`Those parents are mostly important people from various positions.`
`If the romance was a fact and was leaked to the public, the principal would have to commit suicide in shame. In fact, even that might not be enough.`
`In the world of girls, rumors spread fast.`
`Especially when they're separated from boys and are obsessed with dirty thoughts.`
`So, this kind of rumor goes around really quickly.`
`The sisters try to get rid of that kind of rumor, and they warn the students not to be swayed by it.`
`But apparently, they're the ones who are most swayed by those rumors.`
`This means that I managed to make them furtively deal with something shady, without contacting families or the authorities.`
`So, if I disappeared in these circumstances, it'd look like I ran away with some teacher.`
`All the male teachers would deny it, of course.`
`However, the school wouldn't believe what they said so easily.`
`...After all, there's a dirty rumor going around.`
`By the time the school finds out about my escape, after they eliminate all the other possibilities...`
`I'll be somewhere safe...`
`I tried hard to spread the rumor that I was involved in the forbidden romance as widely as possible.`
`The sisters questioned me a few times, but since the romance was something I'd made up, they couldn't find anything.`
`No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't find any evidence.`
`After three months, I was certain that I created a solid foundation.`
`I swapped after-dinner duties with my classmates so that I could adjust my schedule on this day.`
`I was even able to fill them with suspicion about me by doing that.`
`Now they'll definitely suspect I ran away with some male teacher.`
`Tonight was the night.`
`I began my chores after dinner.`
`After lights-out, somebody will find out about my disappearance.`
`My generous roommate would probably wait about ten minutes before she reported me to a sister, but no longer than that.`
`I had about an hour tops.`
`But that's enough for me......!`
`I took a step off my regular route.`
`That was the first step toward my great escape.`
`I calmed down and thought...`
`The key shouldn't be wrong.`
`...This lock is old and firm.`
`Isn't it possible that I put the right one in, but the lock was just stiff, and I only thought I got the wrong one?`
`I realized that my nervousness was making me clumsy.`
`The gloves that I'm wearing to avoid leaving fingerprints must be getting in the way, too.`
`......I should try the keys one more time...`
`...I picked the most probable one, and gently inserted it into the keyhole...`
`...It's stiff.`
`...If I twist it too strongly, I might break the key.`
`The moment I thought of giving up, I felt something in my fingertips......`
` The key worked!`
`I slowly opened the door.`
`I could hear the crickets.`
`I don't have to hesitate now,`
` but somehow I'm reluctant to step outside.`
`I can still make excuses up to this point.`
`It might look awkward, but I still can.`
`......But if I take a step outside now, there can be no excuse.`
`If the guards find me, they'll take me to the office immediately.`
`There have been escape attempts before.`
`...That's not really so strange.`
`I don't think I'm the only heathen here.`
`It's understandable that there have been people before who couldn't fit in this place.`
`So the school is well aware of the possibility of escapees.`
`...I've heard rumors about what happened to those who were caught while attempting to escape.`
` ...I don't want to believe any of those stories, though.`
`...You see, all the school's horror stories involved students who attempted escapes.`
`...Whatever... Bring it on...`
`I'm not expecting to get a second chance anyway.`
`...There'll always be only one chance.`
`Things get serious beyond this door...!!`
`I psyched myself up and... pushed the door open.`
`A strong smell was hanging in the air.`
`Is that normal for the outside?`
`I'd never smelled this strong grassy smell before.`
`Is there something going on...?`
`Do I have to be wary of it?`
`Should I go back and wait for another chance...?`
`......That's silly.`
`There's nothing strange going on.`
`This smell is something I smell every day.`
`...I just wasn't aware of it.`
`It's true, isn't it?`
`Even though I pretend to be cool, I'm nothing but a nervous wreck...`
`...Calm down...`
` Calm down, Shion...!`
`I can rely only on the map inside my head from this point onward.`
`I'd researched the locations of all the surveillance cameras.`
`...I'm confident that I'll be able to avoid all of them,`
` but I'm not sure about the guards.`
`They pick their patrol routes randomly, after all.`
`I have to take a chance.`
`I can hide myself in most places...`
`But there's an area where there's nowhere to hide for several meters.`
`I concentrated to keep my senses keen.`
`......Well, I have to depend on my luck in the end.`
`Even if I do my best, the guard might find me by mere chance.`
`On the contrary, I might be able to get away no matter how unwisely I choose to move, if I'm lucky.`
`......Damn. After all that effort, it just boils down to luck?`
`Aha ha. This is a gamble after all.`
`When I realized that, I got excited.`
`Yes, this is a gamble.`
` I'm trying my luck.`
`This is a game to test the determination to change my life.`
`If somebody failed to escape from this school, that meant they didn't have enough luck to survive in the real world.`
`But I'm different.`
`I'm going to get out of here.`
` I'm testing my luck.`
` Here goes, Shion!`
`I ignored the noisy bugs and concentrated only on suspicious sounds.`
`......I heard no threats...`
` ...The loudest sound wasn't the bugs--it was my own heartbeat.`
`Crunch.`
`...Even my own footsteps were so loud they could break my eardrums...`
`With each and every step, my overactive imagination tormented me with premonitions of unexpected run-ins with guards.`
`Countless times that torture grew too hard to bear, and I thought of running.`
` ...But if I broke into a run, the noise I made would only draw suspicion.`
`If anyone heard running at a time and place where people shouldn't be, they would realize something abnormal was happening.`
`But if the footsteps they heard were just walking, then they'd likely think nothing of it.`
`Of course, I don't plan on even letting them hear those footsteps.`
`I tried to extend my senses to get as much information as possible.`
`I didn't sense anyone's presence.`
`......I might have felt safer if I heard a guard in the distance.`
`I'm worried that my senses might not be keen enough to detect everything.`
`Somebody might be right behind me... without me being aware of it...`
`I didn't want to make any noise, so I stopped from time to time.`
`...It's like I'm constantly fidgeting...`
`To stop or to run...`
` something within urged me to choose from either one.`
`I can't choose to stop.`
`I have to keep going quickly and stealthily.`
`...I'm already risking so much just by being here.`
`Running, of course, would be absurd.`
`...Ah, I know that......!`
` The urge to run continued to bug me.`
`My head was filled with those thoughts as I went through this dangerous territory.`
`I succeed in passing through without running into anybody.`
`...I couldn't help but sit for a moment and exhale the rotten air from my lungs.`
`......My negative thoughts vanished quickly.`
`......Just a little more to go.`
` ...Just a little more!`
`Just through that bush over there is the fence that separates this place and the outside world.`
`Once again, I strongly felt the urge to run.`
`...I suppressed that desire and carefully tackled the final step......`
`The beautiful-looking fence didn't seem designed to prevent escapes.`
`While I was worried that somebody might see me climbing up the fence, it fortunately didn't happen.`
`It's even possible that this fence might have a touch sensor.`
`...It's too late now.`
`It doesn't mean anything now, since I'm already climbing up.`
`From the top, the fence seemed about seven feet high.`
`I have to go down carefully, just like when I climbed up.`
`......I knew that logically, but I couldn't think that way anymore.`
`I chose to jump off with no hesitation.`
`Of course, I regretted my decision during the fall.`
`I got scared because the flight was longer than I expected.`
`I didn't land beautifully. I fell onto my butt.`
`But there was nobody around to laugh, and I didn't have time to be embarrassed.`
`I looked around to see if anybody heard my landing.`
`Even the crickets weren't interested in the sound I made. I felt relieved...`
`I looked at my watch.`
`...Five minutes till 8 PM.`
`...It was just a fifteen-minute escape.`
`Putting a number to it really made it obvious how short it had been.`
`Looking back, most of the time I was just asking myself questions and hesitating.`
`......I guess I worried too much.`
`But I can't be too relaxed just yet.`
`There's no guarantee that I fooled all the cameras.`
`This place isn't a bank.`
`There won't be a fire alarm going off even if the guards did see me.`
`It's possible they're rushing this way right now.`
`I can't enjoy the air of freedom yet.`
`I hid myself in the darkness and waited.`
`There's still time left until the rendezvous.`
`I watched the school premises while waiting, but it looked like nothing strange was going on.`
`The building was lit up, and the beautiful Western-style architecture made it hard to believe that it was a school.`
`......It should be armed with electrifying wires, searchlights, and guard dogs, like the prison it is.`
`I thought I'd experience a surge of school memories in a situation like this,`
` but it didn't happen.`
`That sort of thing only happens when you have good memories.`
`I have no good memories of this school, so there's nothing to remember.`
`...But if I could pick a series of images to recall, it'd be the luxurious dinners we had every night.`
`So, my memories would be nothing but international cuisine: Japanese, Chinese, French and so on...`
`......What the hell?`
`That's just too funny.`
` I burst into laughter.`
`...At that point, I heard a car approaching.`
`I crouched in the darkness.`
`The plate number is the same as I was expecting...`
` That's the car.`
`I jumped out and rushed to the passenger side, then opened the door and got in.`
`"Nice to see you,`
` Shion-san."`
`The driver was a man of early old age.`
`......He'd be angry if he heard me say that, though.`
` He thinks he's still middle-aged.`
`He looked at my face and learned that I succeeded. He smiled.`
`"Ah, the air feels so fresh!`
` I wanna eat a burger for a start!"`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
` ...I heard they serve excellent food in the school, but...`
` I suppose you were served nothing but gruel, huh?"`
`"No way, dumbass!!`
` I was just kidding.`
` Step on the gas if you have time to laugh at me!"`
`"As you wish..."`
`Kasai really did laugh out loud. After telling me to buckle up, he accelerated.`
`The cathedral-like school disappeared from the mirror in an instant.`
`It disappeared so quick that I didn't have time for a surge of dinner memories.`
`Goodbye, my lovely school days!`
`Ha ha! I'm going to fill my stomach with junk food from now on!`
`I'll forever be free from the table manners you taught me!`
` Aha!`
` Serves you right!`
`As we drove, the scenery began to change.`
` Soon we were surrounded by vast fields of crops and few streetlights.`
`It reminded me that this was just the countryside of Japan, not Europe.`
`"Are you hungry?`
` Would you like me to stop somewhere to eat?"`
`"That's okay. I already ate."`
`I lied.`
`I'm actually a bit hungry.`
`I didn't eat much at dinner to avoid slowing myself down with a full stomach.`
`I appreciated Kasai's offer, but I didn't feel like taking the time to eat while we were still in enemy territory.`
`"It's late, so you'll find only vending machines at the highway rest stops...`
` Oh, I've heard there are hamburger`
` and oden vending machines nowadays."`
`"Huh?!`
` What the hell?`
` Will that dispense a cup and the ingredients, like a coffee vending machine...?`
` That's gross!"`
`"Aha ha, I don't think it's like that.`
` It usually comes in a can."`
`"...Uh, sorry.`
` I can't stand canned food."`
`"Still...?`
` I thought you might have grown out of it."`
`"...I haven't because I can't.`
` Shut up.`
` Why are you laughing?!"`
`Kasai chuckled.`
`He must have been trying to help me relax.`
`...He isn't usually so talkative.`
`"I'm exhausted.`
` I'm going to get some sleep...`
` How do I recline this?"`
`"Look for the lever on the lower left part of the seat.`
` Can you find it?"`
`"Oh, here it is......`
` Here I go."`
`Kasai laughed again.`
`"Did I do something funny?"`
`"No...`
` It's just that the way you talked sounded like Mion-san."`
`...Well, obviously.`
`Mion and I are identical twins.`
` We're perfect copies of each other.`
`When I react to something, so will Mion.`
`When Mion reacts to something in a certain situation, I'll react the same way.`
`"How's sis?"`
`"I believe she's fine.`
` I only see her when I bring your father to the family councils."`
`"That's right, she doesn't live in our parents' home anymore.`
` She's living with the hag in Hinamizawa now, isn't she?"`
`"She moved into the main house around the same time you started going to that school."`
`...I responded with disinterest even though I was the one to ask about her in the first place.`
`The main house is where Oryou (the current leader of the Sonozaki family) lives.`
`That's my grandma, who I call a hag.`
`......But when we use the phrase 'the main house,' that usually means more than just a dwelling.`
`What Kasai refers to is the same thing.`
`"...Did she change?"`
`"You mean Mion-san?"`
`"Yeah...`
` I think she has to have changed if she's living so closely with the hag."`
`Kasai chuckled yet again.`
`He knows I hate my grandma.`
`"I haven't noticed any changes...`
` She's still the Mion-san you know."`
`"What about me?`
` ...Did I change?"`
`"No,`
` not at all."`
`Kasai responded quickly with a smirk.`
`......I haven't seen him for a while, though. It's not fun if he answers this quickly.`
`I glared at him... and then he burst out laughing.`
`"Aha ha ha!`
` You haven't changed at all.`
` That's admirable, since you've been in such a strict school for so long!`
` Heh heh heh heh...!"`
`"Damn it...`
` Laugh as much as you want!`
` I'm going to sleep!"`
`"There's a blanket in the back.`
` Please make use of it."`
`"Um, thanks."`
`I grabbed the blanket and rolled up in it.`
`I'm exhausted, but I can't go to sleep. It's strange.`
`Or maybe not.`
`I must be tired from the escape.`
`It's just that I'm still feeling tense.`
`So, I have to declare it once again, if only to calm myself.`
`"I'm sleeping!`
` I totally am!"`
`"All right. It's the third time you said that.`
` Do I have to give you permission to sleep?"`
`"You're talking too much!`
` I can't go to sleep if you don't quiet down!"`
`"I apologize, princess.`
` I'll keep quiet now...`
` Heh heh heh...!"`
`This interaction with Kasai reminded me of the old peaceful days in Okinomiya.`
`Well, I don't really know if I can call those days peaceful.`
`We were in the middle of the dam protests back then, after all.`
`We all united together, and now that I think about it, we pulled a lot of pretty dangerous stunts.`
`If the authorities ever find out what I did, I'd never escape going to juvie...`
` ...Well, at least half the people in Hinamizawa would be off to prison.`
`We didn't think of them as criminal acts, though.`
`It was a war.`
`It might also have been a festival.`
`A festival where every person in Hinamizawa joined together in protest.`
`It was a struggle, but it was also fun.`
`It was fun to throw stones at the riot police with everybody.`
`We hid ourselves in somebody's home when they chased after us.`
`We'd even go crowd around the police station, demanding the release of our arrested comrades.`
`When we snuck into the construction site and sabotaged it, it felt more like we were playing at war than conducting one.`
`I got so excited back then.`
`...I felt united with my fellow members, even though they were strangers to me, and that memory warms my heart.`
`Yes, the way it felt back then... was like helping everyone to carry a sacred palanquin through the village, getting all sweaty and exhausted together. `
`...Until we all collapsed face-first on the ground, and shared our excitement and cheers with unfamiliar faces over tea.`
`I was just a kid back then.`
`I remember accompanying young men who worked for my dad out to the village to do various bad things.`
`I was arrested a few times.`
`It didn't feel any different, though, than when I was called to the teacher's office for forgetting my homework.`
`......The other villagers were furious about the dam project,`
` but for those of us who were kids at the time, it's a pretty fun memory.`
`All that came to a sudden end a few years ago.`
`It wasn't only the power of the protest that ended the dam construction project.`
`The Sonozaki family and my dad's organization had worked secretly in the shadows.`
`...This is top-secret information in the Sonozaki family, but...`
` it's said they may or may not have kidnapped the Minister of Construction's grandson...`
` in order to blackmail him.`
`The grandson was found a few days after the abduction.`
`......He was found in the mountains of Yagouchi.`
`He didn't simply disappear,`
` and he wasn't demoned away.`
` That means some kind of deal was made secretly.`
`A year after that, the dam construction plan was halted indefinitely.`
`The police suspected the villagers' involvement and investigated,`
` but they couldn't find any leads.`
`The villagers never betrayed each other.`
`They'd do anything to protect their fellow man.`
`......They fabricated fake alibis and fake evidence...`
`...It was easy to deceive the police...`
` Guh!`
`The car suddenly shook, snapping me out of it. It must have run over a bump or something.`
`......I suddenly realized my expression was a very happy one for some reason.`
`...Ah.`
`I must be looking forward to going home.`
`"Shion-san...`
` Are you awake?"`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Would you like me to take you to the house in Okinomiya?"`
`"Where else would you be taking me?"`
`I answered straightforwardly with a frown.`
`Kasai, then, also chose to reply straightforwardly.`
`"It was the family head who decided on your enrollment in St. Lucia,`
` and you ran away from there...`
` You do understand the situation you're in?"`
`"The school the hag chose didn't fit me, that's all."`
`"...Shion-san."`
`"...I know, I know.`
` Shut up."`
`As the head of the Sonozaki family, the hag's decisions are absolute.`
`...They're nothing like, say, the three-second rule.`
`Worse, the decision to confine me to an academy far away from the Sonozaki family... was made before I was even born.`
`'Shion'`
` was the name they gave me...`
`My sister 'Mion' has a character that means 'demon' in her name.`
` That was to signify that she's the successor of demons.`
`In other words, she would be the successor to the Sonozaki family and its demonic bloodline.`
`My name, 'Shion,' has a character that means 'temple' in it.`
`This means that I was destined to take the veil and be confined in a temple.`
`Thinking of that reminds me how much I hate this name of mine.`
`For starters, the person known as Shion is an abominable being to the Sonozaki family.`
`Because it meant the family had two heirs.`
`...I don't have to cite the countless historical examples to explain. It's easy to imagine how that could prove troublesome for succession.`
`According to our long-held family traditions,`
` one of the twins was to be strangled to death right after birth.`
` Unbelievable, isn't it?`
`What that means...`
`...Is that I have to be grateful just to be alive and breathing to this day.`
`I heard the hag actually put her hands around my neck right after I was born.`
`...I don't know what exchange took place in that moment.`
`Maybe some brave relative of mine managed to get her to stop.`
`Or maybe she was in an extremely good mood that day.`
`(Then don't try to strangle me!)`
`We're twins.`
` There are no apparent differences between us.`
`But the first one out of my mom's stomach was named "Mion," and the second one drew the short straw and got named "Shion."`
`Everyone else was desperate to tell us apart, but we sisters just found that awfully ridiculous.`
`There wasn't any difference between us.`
`No one could tell us apart, even if we only swapped hats.`
`We wondered why all the grownups were trying to see the differences.`
`Well, our fun as twins didn't last forever.`
`One day, they created an undeniable, clear distinction between Mion and Shion.`
`Mion went to the main Sonozaki house to live with the hag and to learn how to become the successor.`
`And I was to be confined at St. Lucia's.`
`...I have no objections to Sis's inheritance.`
`I used to be jealous,`
` but now I feel that having to learn about and follow the traditions would just make me tired. I even feel sorry for Mion.`
`So, I'm not going to be a threat to the family even if I'm back in Okinomiya.`
`But... the hag doesn't seem to think that way.`
`She thinks of me as some kind of evil omen.`
`...That's why she wanted to keep me away from her.`
`That doesn't matter to me...`
` I don't want to see her face either.`
`I don't care if she doesn't allow me to enter Hinamizawa.`
`She can charge me 10,000 yen per step I take there.`
`But I want her to let me live in Okinomiya, where I grew up.`
`When I was little, I was in Hinamizawa, but I don't remember it much`
` and I'm not very attached to it.`
`I do have good memories of my elementary school days in Okinomiya.`
` The town isn't very sophisticated, but I kind of like it there.`
`"If you go back to Okinomiya, somebody from the family will notice you,`
` and then they'll report you to the main house."`
`"Are you worried the hag will hear about me?`
` ......Ha ha ha, that might be a problem."`
`"......I hope you understand the situation."`
`"......What, Kasai?`
` ...Are you telling me to go back to that awful place?"`
`"No.`
` I'm not.`
` What I'm trying to say is..."`
`"...You want to know whether I'm prepared or not?"`
`"I just hope you understand what might happen."`
`"Well, I know what you mean.`
` You'll be held responsible for helping me escape if things go bad, right?`
` You should caress your pinky finger while you can, Kasai, before they take it away from you...`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"You should look forward to being rolled up in a futon mat and thrown into the Onigafuchi Swamp, in that case.`
` Ah, maybe they'll send you to the torture room in the garden."`
`I heard there's a big torture room in the main Sonozaki house.`
` I've never seen it, though.`
`I heard they used to torture and kill the enemies of the village in there...`
`...It's just awful, really.`
`I hope I don't end up as a victim of that place.`
`"Okay, okay.`
` Everything's going to be all right.`
` Ahahahaha."`
`"You really resemble your mother.`
` In the way you take chances, I mean."`
`"That's normal. She's my mom.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`My dad and mom will be furious if they find out about my escape...`
`I'm more afraid of them than of the hag.`
`I don't want to go into the details, but my dad is part of the yakuza.`
`He's in charge of the organization which covers the Shishibone area. He's in a very important position.`
`So is Kasai here.`
`He's an old friend of dad, who really trusts him.`
`I don't know if this is true, but I heard Kasai used to be very aggressive, though he's gentle now.`
`I also heard he has tons of scars.`
`He was in charge of a few large areas, but after he was injured badly in a fight, he retired. Now he's my dad's consultant (a.k.a. a drinking buddy).`
`He was my caretaker in my childhood, and now I feel like he's my butler.`
`At first, I thought my dad asked him to supervise me, so I hated him.`
`But in time, I started to feel like he was on my side.`
`...This is just a hunch.`
`...But I think Kasai used to be in love with my mom.`
`My dad, mom, and Kasai were in a love triangle.`
`Though my dad took the lead in the end.`
`Kasai couldn't leave my mom entirely, so he stayed around as my dad's friend.`
`I can tell that`
` from the way he acts...`
`He's seeing my mom in me.`
`That's why he says I look like my mom every now and then.`
`It kind of gave me the creeps at first, but he isn't a bad guy at all.`
`...He's actually pretty funny. I only found that out after I got used to him.`
`So, when I thought about escaping, I naturally turned to him. `
`I contacted him in an early stage of my plan and arranged to meet him today.`
` You could call him a conspirator.`
`...It's not surprising he's worried about my return to Okinomiya.`
`Considering the rules and traditions... cutting off his pinky finger isn't too far from reality.`
`Ahaha. I might be rolled up in a futon mat and thrown into the swamp for real, too.`
`Even so, there's only one place for me to return.`
`I'm going to Okinomiya, and nowhere else.`
`That's my hometown.`
`...This might be a kind of homesickness,`
`but I don't care what it looks like.`
`"So, what are you going to do?`
` The Sonozaki family is everywhere."`
`"Well, I'll lay low for now.`
` If somebody sees me, I'll tell them I'm Mion.`
` Ahaha!"`
`"Then what?"`
`"Then, after things calm down a little bit, I'll start talking to my closest relatives.`
` I know they'll be on my side.`
` I know some people who covered for me when I had a fight with my dad once."`
`"I see.`
` You're trying to create a fait accompli so that the Sonozaki main house will have to accept you later on......?`
` I hope that works."`
`"It will!`
` There were many people who were opposed to the idea of enrolling me in that school.`
` That decision was obviously made because of the hag's hatred toward me...`
` Don't you agree, Kasai?"`
`"......Well, yes...`
` I thought that decision was excessive."`
`"She couldn't make the right decision because she was suffering from menopause!`
` All the fuss surrounding the dam protest drove her nuts!"`
`Kasai smiled.`
`I couldn't go to sleep after all, even though I was rolled up in a blanket.`
`Even though I told Kasai to shut up, I kept talking to him.`
`......In time,`
` I got tired of talking.`
` As I could feel the car run smoothly on the highway. Kasai spoke to me again.`
`"Shion-san...`
` Look."`
`"..............."`
`I was so tired that I ignored him.`
`...I wondered what he wanted me to look at, but I wasn't that interested.`
`Yet I opened my eyes slightly and saw a sign quickly pass by.`
`Kasai probably wanted me to see that sign.`
`It had an illustration of azaleas around the letters that said--`
`'Welcome to Shishibone City.'`
`My hometown is coming right up.`
