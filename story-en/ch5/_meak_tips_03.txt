`My aunt finally stopped her hysterical screaming.`
`Today was just like any other day.`
`I can't remember what set her off. Whatever it was, she changed subjects constantly anyway. It didn't matter.`
`She went on past midnight again.`
`The urge to sleep was pounding the back of my head.`
`Once Satoko had been able to relax... she fell down on the spot and started sleeping, still clinging to my sleeve.`
`I carried Satoko to the bedroom and laid out our futons.`
`"Here, Satoko.`
` Your futon is ready,`
` so get in, okay?"`
`Satoko crawled in like a worm. She stopped moving once she was inside.`
`I wished I could go to bed, too.`
`But... I couldn't.`
`My aunt asked me to do some chores.`
`I had to get toothpaste after school tomorrow.`
` I had to write it down somewhere...`
`I had to make rice for lunch tomorrow...`
` I set the timer.`
`Right, I also had to repile the towels in the bathroom. That was the reason for today's scolding...`
`My aunt will get mad if everything isn't done the way she wants.`
`Oh, and there was something else.`
`...I was working at the grocery store the next day.`
`They wanted me to bring an apron.`
`...Did we even have an apron in this house...?`
` I'd never seen one...`
`My aunt will be sleeping when I go to school, so I won't have time to ask her.`
`What should I do? Since Mion helped me get that job, I don't want to screw it up.`
`In that case, why don't I ask Mion about it at school?`
` She might lend me one.`
`Was there anything else...?`
` Hmmmmm......`
`I was envious of Satoko, because she got to go to bed.`
`It was pathetic that I felt that way.`
