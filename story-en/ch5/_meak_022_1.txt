`"Keiichi!`
` I've been calling your name for a while!`
` You have a phone call.`
` ...It's from Sonozaki-san."`
`"S-Sonozaki-san...... which one?`
` The older sister, or`
` the younger one...?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Ask her yourself."`
`"H-`
`Hello...?`
` ......Mion?`
` ...Or is it Shion?"`
`"It's me.`
` ...Shion.`
` Good evening."`
`"Shion!`
` Umm...`
` ...Sorry about... last night.`
` ...I got all riled up..."`
`He must have been worried about how I hung up the phone so suddenly last night.`
`"We're tied to the same fate.`
` Making sure the other is alright is the only way to guarantee our own safety."`
`"...Yeah... I agree."`
`"...We absolutely need to share whatever information we have.`
` ...So that we don't die, like Takano-san and Tomitake-san did."`
`Gulp...`
` I heard Keiichi swallow loudly.`
`"Then... let's continue from where we left off.`
` ...You'll listen without getting angry this time, right?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I'll be fine."`
`Keiichi agreed to be quiet and listen.`
`I explained the dangerous situation Keiichi was in once again.`
`Just like how some evil people in the village attacked Takano-san and Tomitake-san, they might attack us any day.`
`It was ironic, of course, that while I was warning him, I was also the one who made sure the curse would fall upon him.`
`"...Let's report anything we noticed that seemed strange.`
` ...If we connect all the tiny pieces that we have...`
` then just maybe we'll find out who killed them... `
`Or maybe even the truth behind the incidents of the past few years."`
`"...Mm... you're right.`
` ...You're right about that."`
`"...Then I'll start, since I suggested it.`
` ...I feel like somebody has been watching me lately."`
`"What...?!?!"`
`I was making this up.`
` I just wanted him to realize how urgent the situation was.`
`"......It might be my imagination, but...`
` I'll tell you anyway.`
` ...I think it's just me, but... if you feel like you're being watched too, Kei-chan, then...`
` ...Maybe it's not just in my head..."`
`"W-Well... Don't worry.`
` ...At the very least... Everything's fine with me."`
`It seemed like nothing had happened to Keiichi today, at least.`
`Now that the heads of all the Three Families were gone, it was possible the curse system had been destroyed entirely.`
`If that was the case, then Keiichi might not be attacked after all.`
`But if there was someone who did want to attack him, that meant part of the system was still alive.`
`In other words, my mission wouldn't be accomplished just yet.`
`Keiichi is like a litmus test in this situation.`
`I'd know whether or not all my enemies were gone depending on if Keiichi got bitten.`
`He sure is a very useful man.`
`After that, I went along with what Keiichi said.`
`I made sure he was fearful of Mion, as well as all of the Three Families.`
`I explained to him the possibility that the whole village was involved, and that the curse of Oyashiro-sama might be some sort of system.`
`Then I remembered Shion wouldn't know too much about the disappearance of the mayor, so I continued.`
`"...I just heard this myself...`
` Is it true... that Uncle Kimiyoshi went missing?"`
`"You mean the mayor...?`
` Wait, Shion...`
` you haven't heard?"`
`"I don't know anything!`
` ...I just overheard my father talking about it on the phone again."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Actually... last night, after the meeting, he didn't come home, so the whole village was in a panic.`
` They searched all over Hinamizawa, but if they've found him, then I haven't heard... `
`The police should be searching for him as well..."`
`"Wh-Why didn't you tell me something that important right away???!!"`
`"S-Sorry...`
` I thought you already knew...`
` I didn't want to hide it or anything...!"`
`"............Kei-chan...`
` ...What...`
` ......What should I do...?"`
`"...What's wrong?`
` ...Tell me.`
` We're not keeping secrets from each other, right...?"`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` ...I... well, I didn't mean to hide it.`
` ...It was just that, well, the conversation got turned around and..."`
`"...We're on the same side, right?!`
` I won't get mad, so just tell me..."`
`"I...`
`......`
` Uncle Kimiyoshi, I...`
` ...I told him everything."`
`"......Old man Kimiyoshi... He's someone you feel comfortable confiding in, Shion...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...He would... When I was little, he was really nice to me...`
` ...All I did was play tricks on him... but he would always just smile...`
` ...He listened to anything I had to say... `
`...He was such a kind person..."`
`"...C-Calm down, Shion.`
` ...It's not like he's dead, right?`
` Don't lose heart so easily..."`
`Keiichi tried to make me feel better.`
`But he had no idea what was actually going on.`
`It really made me laugh.`
`"......That night...`
` ...I told the mayor...`
` that we snuck into the ritual storehouse.`
` ...Also that someone saw us... and was out to get us."`
`"...Does the mayor know how absurdly Takano-san and Tomitake-san died...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...He knew about it.`
` ...I told him that they died by Oyashiro-sama's curse... and that I could be made a sacrifice to calm his anger.`
` ...I just said it straight out."`
`"...Right.`
` ...What then?"`
`"...Uncle Kimiyoshi... didn't get angry.`
` ...He smiled, then told me that if I was remorseful about it, there was no way I'd be demoned away...`
` ...He was really...`
` ...smiling... ...and he told me to leave it to... him...`
` ...ngh...!!"`
`I actually got a little sad while saying that.`
`Uncle Kimiyoshi had been so reliable.`
`I was happy when he said that he would protect Shion.`
` I truly was happy.`
`If only he hadn't said anything to insult Satoshi-kun...!!`
`".........It's my fault.`
` ...Because I... I confessed everything..."`
`"...Stop it, Shion...`
` ...It's not your fault."`
`"No!`
` It is my fault!`
` I... I told him our secret...!`
` Uncle Kimiyoshi found out about everything...!`
` So... he had to have been killed!!`
` ...It was right after I confessed to him, after all!! `
`He disappeared the same night... and he told me everything was going to be all right!!"`
`It was such a strange feeling.`
`I wasn't upset at all.`
`But as I pretended to be upset and mutter words of prayer for Kimiyoshi's safety, I started to feel that emotion growing inside me.`
`I was only pretending to be distressed to fool Keiichi,`
` yet the emotion I feigned began welling up inside me... ...It felt like I was being consumed by that emotion.`
`So the words coming from my mouth... weren't words I intentionally said.`
`...They were words that consuming emotion forced me to say.`
`It was like someone else inside of me was doing the talking instead...`
`And I was just watching that someone talk from a short distance away...`
`"I should never have told him!!!`
`All of this... should have only been our fault! Only the four of us!!`
` It wasn't something I should have told someone else!!`
` He got killed because I told him!`
` He got killed because he knew!`
`He got killed...`
`...`
` because I confessed to him!!!!`
`"`
`"Hey, stop!!`
` If they were doing that... then they would obviously have killed you before killing the mayor!`
` It doesn't make sense!`
` You or I should have been killed first!!`
` Why would other people die before us?!!"`
`"It does make sense!`
` They must be planning to kill us last of all!!"`
`"...Hah...?`
` Wha... What!?"`
`"...'They' start by killing those we're close to... and after they've caused us so much pain, then they'll kill us... That must be what they're doing!!"`
`What I just said scared even me.`
`Killing our loved ones first to harm us emotionally, and only then kill us at the height of our suffering.`
`Whoaaaaaa,`
` I felt something crawling up my spine.`
`That's awesome! It's an awesome idea!`
`I must not be human anymore. I really am a demon.`
`A human could never think of such cruel things!!`
`That would be one incredible Hell...`
` Your close friends dying one at a time after being tortured.`
` And after all that, you yourself get killed...`
`What a great way to destroy someone's life...!`
`Why was I getting so excited about this?`
` ...Because I could get going with that plan right away!!`
` Heh hehehehehehe heh heh heh!!!`
`"...Ri...... Rika-chan!!`
` It's Rika-chan!!!!"`
`"......What?`
` ...What did you say just now...?!"`
`"I... I, well...`
` ...The truth is...`
` ...I...`
` ...I told her about it.`
` ...I told Rika-chan...`
` ...today!!"`
`"Rika-chan... You mean Rika-chama?`
` The one from the Furude Shrine?"`
`"Yes, Rika-chan!`
` ...I felt... I felt so scared and uneasy... that I did it.`
` ...I told Rika-chan."`
`"...When you did... what did she say...?"`
`"...The cat is worrying too much.`
` I'll do something about it for sure.`
`That's what Rika-chan said...!!`
` ...I-I'm sorry, Shion!`
` I-I-I... I'm a bit... I'm worried about Rika-chan...!!"`
`"Ah, right! ...If you're that concerned, then don't worry about me.`
` Please, go find out whether she's safe."`
`"Y-Yeah...!`
` I'll do that!"`
`"I'll call you again tomorrow at the same time.`
` When I do, you'll know I'm still alright."`
`"...I got it.`
` I'll be waiting.`
` Okay, bye!`
` Sorry!`
` I'm hanging up!!"`
`Keiichi hung up roughly.`
`"......`
`Ah ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`What a hilarious conversation with Keiichi.`
`Everything was just too damn funny.`
`Keiichi Maebara,`
` go ahead and struggle helplessly.`
`Run all over the village and see if the curse is still alive.`
`Go ahead and see if my enemies are still around!`
`I laughed for a while and then calmed down.`
`I'd already got rid of the bicycles and shoes belonging to Rika and Satoko.`
`My house was, for the moment, taken care of.`
`I could expect Keiichi`
` to run around in a panic,`
` to ask for help from someone,`
` and then ultimately come to Mion.`
`More than likely, the youth group would end up looking for Rika like they did with the mayor.`
`...I'd probably have to endure another long night again, knowing nobody would find her.`
`I decided to wait until the phone rang.`
`I killed time by watching TV until it did.`
