`Sis called the morning after the Watanagashi festival to tell me that the curse had struck again for the fourth time.`
`The victim was the evil aunt who was harassing Satoshi-kun and Satoko.`
`Satoshi-kun's suffering should be over now, since the problem was with Satoko and the aunt's relationship to begin with.`
`Maybe I should have celebrated,`
` but I wasn't in the mood for some reason.`
`"...Do the police have a lead on the suspect?"`
`Sis went quiet when I asked that.`
`"I don't know.`
` Ooishi seems to be questioning people in the neighborhood.`
` He thinks the culprit is somebody close to the victim."`
`Being identical twins,`
` Sis and I think very much alike. `
`If I suspected Satoshi-kun of being the murderer, so would she.`
`Because of this, I didn't have to mention the obvious.`
`"...Does Satoshi-kun have an alibi for that day...?"`
`"Eh,`
` umm...`
` I don't know."`
`"Hahh..."`
`I heaved a huge sigh.`
`"Are you stupid?`
` He was at the festival,`
` didn't you see him there?"`
`"Um... yeah... right.`
` I'm sorry I didn't realize that..."`
`I heaved another sigh.`
`Sis was stupid enough to forget to make an alibi for him even though the murder of his aunt alone would raise enough suspicion.`
`"...So, that means...`
` he did do it...?"`
`"That's not important now!`
` The problem is whether he has an alibi or not!`
` ...Tch."`
`"Well... the police are going to come here later. I'll tell them I was with him at the festival."`
`"...Sis?`
` Lying out of the blue like that won't work.`
` If you haven't done anything to ensure his alibi, it's too late now.`
` Please just be honest with them. I can't trust your acting skills. `
`You might raise more suspicion if you make something up on the spot..."`
`"...Yeah... sorry..."`
`She sounded depressed. I was the one who should have been depressed.`
`Mion usually handles things well, but she's not too good with emergencies.`
`I was left worried for the future of the Sonozaki family.`
`Mion must have been embarrassed.`
` She soon changed the subject.`
`"I guess you haven't been able to work lately, have you...?"`
`"You're right, I haven't.`
` ...Thanks to you."`
`"Uh... I'm sorry about that...`
` I'll hide somewhere until tonight, so maybe you can work today...?"`
`Sis has been appearing in public places during festival preparations and whatnot.`
`As a result, I hadn't been able to pretend to be her.`
`I hadn't been able to work.`
`As someone who had to support myself, it was a bit of a pain.`
`To be honest, I didn't feel like working.`
`...But I couldn't afford to be sitting around, either.`
`When I locked my apartment door before leaving, the door of the next apartment over opened and Kasai appeared.`
`"Shion-san, are you heading out...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm going to work, since Sis gave me time until tonight.`
` Can you give me a ride?"`
`".........Shion-san, wouldn't it be safer for you to take a few days off?`
` The police seem to be staking out the main house.`
` I don't think it's a good idea to leave."`
`"I appreciate your concern, but I have to make money to survive."`
`Kasai might suggest he'd donate money to my cause.`
`However, I had sworn to myself when I started living here that I wouldn't depend on Kasai.`
`While I don't obey anyone else's rules, I stick to my own.`
`Kasai could tell that I was adamant in my decision.`
`So, after repeating himself a couple of times as a formal procedure, he decided to give me a ride after all.`
`Every time we went to my uncle's store by car, we stopped at this traffic light.`
`I knew it was going to happen again, but it still irritated me.`
`Pedestrians passed by in front of the car.`
`I was startled to see that one of them looked like Satoshi-kun.`
`...It was him.`
`Though I'd spoken with him on the phone just a couple of days before, it'd been a while since I saw him last.`
`"Kasai.`
` Sorry, but could you tell my uncle that I can't come today?`
` I'm getting off here."`
`"What?`
` Shion-san?!"`
`Kasai looked taken aback, but I got out of the car regardless.`
`The light turned green.`
`The car behind him honked while Kasai was shouting at me, so he had to start moving.`
`Satoshi-kun was on his bike, but he was going really slowly. I caught up with him in a flash, and tapped him on the back.`
`"Hello.`
` I'm surprised to see you in Okinomiya, Satoshi-kun."`
`If I talked to him with a smile,`
` he might smile back.`
`...So, I smiled as brightly as I could.`
`"...Mion."`
`He looked tired as always.`
`But as I could tell, he was trying to smile back...`
` my worries suddenly disappeared.`
`I was certain I looked happy.`
`I was aware of that myself, so it must have been obvious to Satoshi-kun.`
`"I don't know the circumstances, but... you look happy."`
`"Yeah, I am happy.`
` I'm happy because you look happy."`
`When I teased him, he looked a bit embarrassed.`
`...It was like we were back in the good old days.`
`I felt even happier than before.`
`"What's going on, Satoshi-kun?`
` Did something good happen?"`
`"...Not really...`
` My aunt died and... I have to deal with the police and the neighbors..."`
`I might've asked something dumb.`
`He seemed to be okay with it, though.`
`He'd frowned a bit at first, but Satoshi-kun continued smiling gently.`
`He looked... worn out, but satisfied, like he had accomplished something great.`
`That was the mood I sensed from him.`
`So... I was convinced.`
`The one who killed that wicked aunt who tormented Satoko...`
` ...was him.`
`I had absolutely no proof, but I knew it intuitively.`
`So I omitted all those questions.`
`I knew Satoshi-kun's motive for killing his aunt, and how badly he was driven into a corner.`
` I knew the environment and the situation he was in.`
`...And I knew Satoshi-kun's feelings.`
` ......I knew all of that.`
`So I omitted all those questions.`
`I wanted to celebrate his release from that curse, so I smiled like nothing was different as I asked...`
`"Where are you going, Satoshi-kun?`
` To work?"`
`"That's right...`
` I have to make a stop before that, though."`
`"...A stop?"`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` I have to make sure it's still there, otherwise I'll continue feeling really anxious..."`
`That conversation reminded me.`
`The reason he started his part-time job was to buy Satoko a huge teddy bear.`
`It was being sold at the toy store just down the street.`
`I recalled that the teddy bear was very expensive.`
`Satoko's birthday was right after the festival.`
`...I wasn't sure what day, though.`
`Wait, didn't he say he quit his job?`
`Maybe he was going to greet his ex-coworkers and clean out his locker, or something?`
`Either way, he'd be completely free very soon.`
`Maybe he hadn't been paid yet. That's why he wanted to check if they still had the teddy bear.`
` Maybe he was only getting paid on Satoko's birthday.`
`When we got near the toy store, he rushed to the display window.`
`He looked relieved that it hadn't been sold yet.`
`"Good, good...`
` All right,`
` it's still there."`
`"You've earned enough money already, haven't you?`
` Why don't you reserve it?"`
`"...Mmph?"`
`He probably hadn't thought of that.`
`...He really did need someone to look after him.`
`I looked into the display window over his shoulder.`
`The teddy bear wasn't that cute, in my opinion. It looked huge and cramped in the middle of the store's showcase.`
`Really, it looked more like a display model than an item for sale.`
`"I don't see a price tag. Is that really for sale?`
` How much is it?"`
`"...Uh, yeah.`
` I'm sure they sell it."`
`"What about the price?`
` Does it fit your budget?"`
`"It's all right. I already checked..."`
`Satoshi-kun thought I was teasing him again. He pouted and looked a little sulky.`
`"There's no problem then.`
` Why don't you go reserve it now?`
` Then you won't have to feel anxious anymore."`
`We entered the store and looked for a clerk.`
`"...Is anybody here...?"`
`"Ahahahaha. Nice.`
` Maybe you can get it without paying."`
`"N-No, Mion.`
` Stealing is bad..."`
`"...I'm just kidding.`
` Trying to make you laugh...`
` Do you think I'd really do that?"`
`"Uh... no. Sorry. Ahahahaha..."`
`Satoshi-kun smiled apologetically.`
`I puffed up my cheeks to tease him.`
`It had really been a while since the last time we did this.`
`In between those times, many undesirable things happened that I wanted to forget.`
`...But now I felt as though all those things simply vanished into the air around us.`
`I found an old person napping in the back. He must be the clerk, I thought.`
`He looked to be fast asleep.`
`"Excuse me...`
` You work here, right...?"`
`I poked his shoulder, but he didn't look like he was going to wake up.`
`When I did that, a middle-aged woman wearing an apron came in.`
`"Grandpa! You fell asleep again!`
` We have customers!`
` I'm really sorry, you two!`
` He's been very flaky, you know."`
`The middle-aged woman shook the old man awake and told him to go back to the living room.`
`She went to the cash register after that.`
`"That was so embarrassing.`
` So, how can I help you?"`
`"Um, I'd like to reserve something.`
` That big teddy bear in the display window."`
`"Oh, that one?`
` Are you sure?`
` That one is really expensive.`
` You know that, right?"`
`"Uh... yes.`
` I think I have enough."`
`"He'll get paid really soon, so he'd like to reserve it."`
`The woman looked a bit hesitant at first, but she eventually wrote down Satoshi-kun's name and accepted the reservation.`
`Satoshi-kun received a slip of paper.`
`"See?`
` You don't have to worry about the teddy bear anymore."`
`"Yeah...`
` I'll get paid soon, too...`
` I feel relieved now."`
`He would've kept coming to check every day if he hadn't done this now.`
`He would've spent his time needlessly worrying.`
`Satoshi-kun looked very relieved indeed.`
`"I should've done it sooner."`
`"...Usually, people do that right away when they want something.`
` It's very rare for somebody not to think of that."`
`"Mm, mmph..."`
`It's so very fun to tease him.`
`...Those painful days seem unbelievable now.`
`Satoshi-kun looked like he'd forgotten everything that happened up until yesterday.`
`"Anyway... thanks."`
`Satoshi-kun held out his hand to touch my head.`
`...Was he going to stroke it? I felt my face reddening already.`
`Even before he touched my head,`
` I felt tingly, remembering the last time.`
`...I didn't care about the murder, or whatever else happened.`
`As long as Satoshi-kun had his freedom, everything would be all right.`
`I'd be content as long as we could live happily from today onward.`
`......But Satoshi-kun's hand never reached my head.`
`I slowly opened my eyes...`
`Only to realize that the situation had drastically changed.`
`There were four men in suits blocking our way.`
`It looked as though they'd been waiting for us to exit the toy store.`
`"Hello, hello.`
` Nfu fu fu fu fu..."`
`The oldest of the four men stepped forward while smirking.`
`I'd never met this man, but it looked like he knew both Mion and Satoshi-kun.`
`He was probably a cop.`
`I ran a search for information in my head...`
` and found some right away.`
`"Good to see both of you,`
` Houjou-san and Sonozaki-san.`
` I'm sorry to bother you at a time like this."`
`This must be Kuraudo Ooishi.`
`...The cop who's investigating the series of mysterious deaths.`
`He thinks that the Sonozaki family is behind all of the cases.`
` In other words, he's an enemy of the Sonozaki family.`
`He has deep connections with other investigation divisions in the police force, and likes to nose around the businesses in this area.`
`...He annoys the Sonozaki family enough as it is by interfering with its yakuza business, let alone his suspicions on the series of mysterious deaths.`
`Naturally, as the family's successor, he's not a welcome figure to Mion Sonozaki.`
`I tried to imagine how Sis would react.`
`"...Oh, Ooishi-san.`
` Thank you for working hard for our safety.`
` Oh, the four of you want something from this toy store?`
` A doll, maybe?`
` Pfff..."`
`I know what they want, and it's`
` not a toy.`
`It's probably not me, either...`
` They want Satoshi-kun.`
`I took a look at Satoshi-kun... He seemed a bit uncomfortable.`
`The other three cops loosely surrounded us to prevent our escape.`
`"Houjou-san,`
` I'd like to talk to you about something."`
`"What for?`
` Are you taking him to the station?`
` You don't have to go with them, Satoshi-kun. Let's get out of here!"`
`I pushed on his shoulder.`
` But he just stood there, looking pale and bewildered.`
`Bewildered?`
`No, he actually looked resigned.`
`......Then`
` I recalled Sis's mistake.`
`It's obvious that he killed his aunt from the circumstances! You don't even have to look at the crime scene!`
`How could Mion have failed to create an alibi...?!`
`That stupid Mion must've spoken to the police without making anything up at all.`
`She must've not told them that she knew where Satoshi-kun was...!`
`If she hadn't done anything, the villagers wouldn't work to help her.`
`It was just a matter of time until the police uncovered Satoshi-kun's complete lack of an alibi.`
`The police were trying to corner him and lead him to confess.`
`...I looked at Satoshi-kun's face once again.`
`He looked like a dead man.`
`He probably didn't know he could refuse to be interrogated.`
`If he was taken to the station and grilled by Ooishi, he'd confess in a minute.`
`...Somebody had to protect him.`
`Nobody had ever been there for him...`
` I had to step up now.`
`But how?!`
`Would it be possible to alter what Mion had already told them, saying it was a mistake?`
` That wasn't going to work.`
`If I had more time, I'd come up with an excellent idea.`
`But I didn't have that much time at all.`
`To pressure him, the cops were drawing nearer.`
`Satoshi-kun must have felt intimidated.`
`He might end up turning himself in due to the pressure while I'm stuck trying to come up with something!`
`I have to do something now!`
`I have to say something!`
`Otherwise, Satoshi-kun might give in.`
`I have to save him...!!`
`Ooishi drew nearer.`
`Satoshi-kun fell back.`
`"...Uh...... ooh..."`
`"It won't take much time.`
` Come on, don't be scared...`
` ...Nfu fu fu fu fu!"`
`It won't take much time?`
` He just said it!`
` He just said he wouldn't let him out if he caught him now!!`
` Satoshi-kun, don't give in! If you give in now, everything you've been working for will be ruined!!`
`"...Ooh..."`
`Satoshi-kun looked like he was at his breaking point. Ooishi was clearly aware of it...`
`Ooishi smirked... and held out his arm to grab Satoshi-kun's shoulder...`
`I felt electrified when I saw that.`
`That hand shouldn't be allowed to touch Satoshi-kun.`
`The moment Ooishi touched his shoulder, he'd give in...!`
`He'd go to the police station and confess everything...!!`
`"Do you want to know his alibi?"`
`"......Hmm?"`
`Ooishi turned his face toward me...`
` his hand left hanging in the air.`
`...I wasn't very prepared for this.`
`I just had to stop Ooishi, no matter what.`
`...I only needed to gain some time.`
`It didn't really matter what I said.`
`"...That's right.`
` I want to get Houjou-san's alibi.`
`Na ha ha... We must not be doing our jobs... we can't seem to confirm his whereabouts at the time of the crime.`
` It's shameful, but we decided to question him in person."`
`"You don't have to ask him.`
` I can confirm his alibi."`
`"Oh,`
` really?`
` That'd help.`
` You already told me that you were at the festival that night and many people can confirm it.`
` It'd be easier if we could confirm that Houjou-san was with you.... `
`But I don't think you mentioned him when I questioned you last time, did you?`
` Are you going to change your statement now? `
`Even though no one at the festival saw Houjou-san, are you going to tell me he was with you?"`
`"That's right.`
` He was with me. Wouldn't that be enough?"`
`"...I know you were there with your other friends that night. I saw that myself.`
`Are you still saying that you were with him?`
` Na ha ha ha...`
` Isn't that a little too hard to believe?`
` Isn't it?"`
`Ooishi approached me with a creepy smile.`
`Was he teasing me because my excuse sounded funny...? I didn't think so.`
`He was frustrated due to being interrupted when he was about to catch a big fish.`
`"Are you saying that you forgot that you were with him, but just now remembered you actually were?`
` Mion Sonozaki-san."`
`I did get a little scared, but... I couldn't stop myself.`
`"I'm not Mion Sonozaki.`
` I didn't go to the Watanagashi festival in the first place."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Satoshi-kun and I were talking in a restaurant in Okinomiya at that time.`
` The name of the place is 'Angel Mort.' You can confirm that with the owner if you want."`
`Ooishi was still smirking, but he apparently felt confused.`
`"...What are you saying?`
` If you aren't Mion, then who are you?"`
`"I'm... Shion Sonozaki.`
` Mion's twin sister.`
` Pleasure to meet you, Ooishi-san."`
`Ooishi looked perplexed, like he didn't believe what I'd said.`
`He frowned.`
`"I didn't know Mion Sonozaki-san had a twin sister...`
` Are you trying to fool me?"`
`"Not at all.`
` Why don't you check my family register, or whatever?`
` Should I call Sis?"`
`All the cops looked bewildered now.`
`"......Shion... Sonozaki-san?"`
`"Yes, that's me.`
` Is there anything wrong?"`
`"...Can you come with us?`
` If you're testifying that you were with Houjou-san that night... I'll have to talk to you, too."`
`"Sure thing.`
` Please go easy on us."`
`The cops gathered at their car and started discussing something.`
`...Looked like they never expected this to happen.`
`I hoped to be able to fake Satoshi-kun's alibi for at least a little while.`
`It shouldn't be too difficult to talk to Sis about this, then forge up an alibi together.`
`"Satoshi-kun.`
` Tell them you were chatting with me at Angel Mort that night, no matter what they ask, okay?`
` I'll confirm your alibi. `
`Tell them you don't remember that night too clearly... or maybe you should just keep silent."`
`"....................."`
`Satoshi-kun wore a startled expression.`
`...Though I was telling him something important, he'd apparently decided not to listen.`
`"Can you hear me, Satoshi-kun?`
` You can't mess this up, okay?"`
`"Uh... o-okay."`
`He must have been feeling deceived.`
`No wonder...`
` I'd just confessed that I wasn't Mion, but her twin sister.`
`I really had been deceiving him.`
`"...Are you upset?"`
`"...Why?"`
`"Because... I've been fooling you."`
`"......Aha ha ha ha ha ha."`
`Satoshi-kun started laughing.`
`I didn't know why he'd laugh,`
` because he wasn't the type of person who would laugh in order to hide something.`
`"I finally understand why you were weird sometimes in class.`
` I'd been thinking it was a bit strange."`
`"......Aren't you upset`
` that I've been fooling you...?"`
`Satoshi-kun looked puzzled.`
`...It was like he didn't know whether he should be upset about it or not...`
` Or maybe he was only pretending to be that way.`
`"So, this isn't the first time we've met, is it...?"`
`"Uh, well... yes, that's right..."`
`"Okay.`
` How do you write your name?"`
`"With the characters for 'poetry' and 'sound.'"`
`"Shion...`
` huh."`
`"Huh?"`
`"That's a beautiful name."`
`"Could you please come with us to the station?`
` We can get you instant coffee or tea if you'd like."`
