`I hadn't been able to get used to my new school in Okinomiya, but I had some friends there now.`
`Since I got a part-time job at my relative's store, I had some extra pocket money too.`
`I ended up living with my parents after all, so I didn't have to pay for living expenses.`
`It felt great to get to freely spend the money I earned from working.`
`I still used the room Kasai set up for me from time to time.`
`It was a convenient hideout for when I didn't want to see my parents.`
`In fact, I was planning to spend a day there today.`
`"...Damn that teacher!`
` She told my parents that I was skipping classes!"`
`My dad got upset, and that was why I didn't want to stay at home. I had been asking for it, though.`
`My teacher should know that my dad is a yakuza, and that he gets really scary when he's mad.`
`On the whole, my life had been going well so far... except that it was boring.`
`The reason I could enjoy this lifestyle is probably because I had to live in secret before.`
`It was a great relief to be able to live without having to fake my identity.`
`...Well, that might've been a valuable experience.`
` I think I learned from it.`
`I was going grocery shopping, and thought I'd get enough food for a week or so.`
`My parents would appreciate my presence more after missing me for a week. I was doing this for their sakes.`
`"Oh? Oh, wait!`
` Isn't there a 100-yen sale today?`
` Yeah, there is!"`
`I knew how to save my pocket money.`
`I was in a good mood. I spun around with my arms spread out.`
` I felt like I was inside a little whirlwind.`
`My arm hit a motorcycle parked on the sidewalk. It obviously wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`"...Ow!!`
` What the...?`
` Who parked this motorcycle here?"`
`I gave the motorcycle a kick with no hesitation.`
`There were three motorcycles lined up in a row.`
`They all fell like dominoes.`
`It was beautiful, and so much fun.`
`.........Oh...?`
`This was odd.`
` I felt like I'd gone through the exact same experience before. `
`While blinking my eyes in an effort to recall when that was, some people grabbed me by the neck and dragged me into a dark alley.`
`It looked like these punks were the owners of those motorcycles. They started shouting at me.`
`...This really was strange... I was having deja vu.`
`"Dafuq're ye, bitch?!!`
` Whatcha think yer doin'?! Huhh?!"`
`"Fookin' bash yer head in, bitch!!"`
`"Grrraaaah!!`
` Gonna pay fer whatcha did!"`
`That's right...`
` It was when I met Satoshi-kun for the first time.`
`He came to save me...`
`...If I pretended to cry again now...`
`...Would he come to save me again...?`
`I made a wish.`
`...And I started pretending to cry and beg for mercy.`
`At that time.`
`I doubted my ears.`
`"...Cut it out.`
` Can't you see she's crying...?!!"`
`It was a boy about my age.`
`I couldn't quite see his face because of the light illuminating him from behind.`
`".........Satoshi... kun...?"`
`Of course... it couldn't be him.`
`...It couldn't be...`
`When I snapped out of my daydream, I realized that it wasn't Satoshi-kun after all...`
`He looked... less gracious than Satoshi-kun, so to speak.`
`If Satoshi-kun was pristine and untouched, then this guy would have scratches all over him.`
`But although they were completely different... I got a similar impression from him somehow.`
`"What da hell...?!`
` What dafuq are ye?!!"`
`"Ye wanna get hurt're what?!"`
`"Fookin' say sumtin'!!`
` Son of a bitchh!!"`
`The boy looked a bit taken aback.`
`"Ah... well...`
` I just thought you might want to let her go because she's crying... so..."`
`"HuuUUUh?!`
` Dafuq ye think ye, tellin' us whatcha do?!"`
`"Whoa, whoa!!`
` Hold on!`
` I'm against violence...!!`
` Ahaha...!"`
`...What was up with this guy...?`
` I felt ashamed that I mistook him for Satoshi-kun even for a second.`
`He seemed cool at first... but he wasn't as cool as Satoshi-kun after all.`
`"Well, I mean... I'm sorry that your motorcycles were knocked down,`
` but I hope you don't feel too bad about it...`
` How could I make you feel better...?`
` Of course, we don't have any money on us, you know?`
` Ahaha..."`
`"Humph... if ye don't got da money, den..."`
`"If ye gotchno money,`
` ye gotta pay wid yer body!!"`
`"Dis chick's got sum real nice boobies...!`
` Let's stripper down'n see...! Yee hee hee hee!!"`
`...Hey,`
` are you kidding me?`
`I tightened my grip on the stun gun in my pocket.`
`Then I turned it up to the maximum intensity. Don't hold a grudge against me if you die, pervs...`
`"I luvvit when girls get stripped in dose porn videos!!`
` Huff, huff!"`
`"Yeah, da strippins is better than da actual sex...!!"`
`...They indulged in their imaginations, which aroused their spirits.`
`...Hey now, why are you perverts closing in on me...?`
`Your gross hands are groping the air... `
`Are you gonna try and violate me?`
`"Mhaaaaaaa, strippins's awesum!!"`
`"Strip her, strip her!!`
` Haahh, yeahhh!!!"`
`"Les' stripper from da top to da bottom!`
` Socks off! She'll be as naked as da jaybird!!"`
`"Hey, are you out of your mind?!`
` Don't touch me with those filthy hands!!!"`
`Then, a flash of light cut through the air...`
` Was that the boy...?!`
`"You stupid fuuucks!!!!"`
`Blows like thunderbolts knocked the punks down!!`
`Wow, so he was actually strong after all?!`
`"What da hell...?!!`
` Ye want sum?!!! `
`Huuuhh?!"`
`"You don't have a clue,`
` idiots!!!!"`
`"Wh-What dafuq are ye on about?!!!"`
`"There's nothing arousing about stark nakedness!!!`
` Leave her socks on at least!!`
` No matter what!! `
`That is the ironclad rule!!!`
`Listen up, monkeys.`
` What's the difference between homo sapiens and other animals?`
` That's right, humans wear clothes!`
` Human beings without clothes are just animals!!!`
`If you get aroused only when the girl is completely naked, you are less than human!!`
` You might as well be animals!!`
` I'm going to knock some sense into you!!`
` Clench those teeth!!!"`
`"Wuff!!"`
`"Orgh!!!"`
`"Ghaaa!!!"`
`"You mentioned a porn movie, didn't you?`
` Let's say there's a 'cosplay sex video.'`
` The definition of 'cosplay' is too broad. `
`To lecture on that subject is as difficult as explaining the spirit of Yamato to yankees parachuting down from B-29s!!`
` So, I'll limit the scope to the most popular one, school uniforms!!`
`What are the three most prominent divisions in the larger category of school uniforms?!!!`
` Answer me!!! `
`That's right, regular uniforms, gym uniforms, and school swimsuits. `
`Both the sailor style and blazer style are included under regular uniforms, by the way.`
` Gym shorts and bloomers are likewise!!`
` And the color preference between white and navy school swimsuits is the same!!! `
`Well, doesn't this sound exciting already?!!`
`Let's say each of you has a preference in one of these three divisions!!`
` Hey you, tall one!! You take the regular uniform!`
` Fat one! You take the gym uniform.`
` And, you, the short one, you take the school swimsuit!!! `
`Picture the image in your head within three seconds!!!`
` Are you done?!`
` That's not good enough, do it again!!!`
`Let's say there's a porn video of your favorite cosplay.`
` Use your imagination.`
` Come on!!`
` Say 'sir, yes, sir' when you got it!!! `
`Are you really military men, you maggots?!! `
`Good, you all seem to have an image in your heads now. Let's move on.`
`Imagine that your favorite cosplay is stripped entirely naked because of your stupid desire.`
` Now, think!!!`
` If you take all of their clothes off, that's not cosplay anymore, is it?! `
`That sort of video is rampant lately!! It's just lamentable! `
`Humans without clothes aren't civilized, they're animals!! `
`If only naked girls excited you, you'd be a pack of dogs, monkeys, or pheasants! `
`Pack your bags and get out!!! `
`Wait, get back here!!`
`As you know, a huge amount of Russian porn vids are going around lately thanks to the end of the Cold War. `
`You don't know that? Get out of here!!`
`I heard that a style called 'beautiful Russian school girl' (which is a combination of the Japanese uniform fetish and some Russian thing) is emerging, but I'll never accept that!!! `
`School uniforms are part of Japanese culture and art!!! `
`Those stupid barbarians will never understand the Japanese spirit!!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` You pathetic squid!!! `
`Clench your teeth, I'll train you 'til you drop!!!`
` I won't let you sleep until you are capable of perfecting your imagination skills!!! `
`Here comes my whip!!!" `
`At that point, I heard a bustle of people running this way.`
`"Maebara-san!!`
` I gathered some people!!!"`
`I saw several kids running toward us.`
` Seemed like our backup had arrived.`
`"Aw shit!`
` Les' get oudda here...!"`
`The three punks had just been standing there agape, but they started running away when they saw that many people...`
`"You're awesome, Maebara-san...!`
` You had those punks transfixed, all by yourself...!"`
`"One of them even had a nosebleed...`
` You're so strong, Maebara-san!"`
`"...Whew...`
` It seems my personal aura has grown more powerful.`
` If this keeps up, I'll soon surpass even Coach's 'Maid in Heaven' Reality Marble!`
` ...Anyway,`
` are you all right, Mion?"`
`The boy was apparently called Maebara. He turned around to face me.`
`...Even the way he mistook me for Mion sounded like Satoshi-kun.`
`...But Satoshi-kun isn't a pervert like him!`
`"I was anxious to see how you'd fight back, but...`
` I guess three guys were too many, huh?`
` I don't believe it! Aha ha ha ha ha!"`
`I was still confused... I couldn't yet grasp the situation.`
`...Who was this guy?!`
` Mion has friends like him?!`
`I was still spacing out in shock.`
`So... I forgot to move`
` until his hand touched my head...`
`"Well, you know...`
` I'll forget that I saw you cry,`
` so... cheer up, okay?"`
`Rub, rub.`
`...The boy called Maebara stroked my head roughly.`
`It didn't feel good.`
` It hurt, actually.`
`But still... his hand had the same warmth.`
`Later on, Mion told me about him.`
`He was called Keiichi Maebara.`
`Kei-chan for short.`
` He's one grade below us.`
`Not only that, but he just moved to Hinamizawa...`
`Thanks to his attitude and lack of manners, he'd already become an idol in their class.`
`Mion joyously explained all of this.`
`...Sure, he sounded like a fun kid.`
`I knew why Mion was into him.`
`...But...`
` Satoshi-kun is way cooler.`
`He wasn't worth stealing from Sis...... Or was he?`
`My heart throbbed.`
` I was excited.`
`It felt like I'd gotten a new toy.`
`I was curious as to what kind of relationship Mion intended to build with him...`
` I'd love to tease her about it.`
`"Thanks, Kei-chan.`
` Let me buy you a drink.`
` My uncle's restaurant is just nearby, so why don't we go there?"`
`Satoshi-kun would refuse out of modesty.`
` But Keiichi Maebara said 'okay' within two seconds.`
`Well then...`
` I couldn't wait to tease the two of them...!`
`My boring life suddenly became bright again.`
`"Whoa... H-Hey, don't cling to my arm..."`
`"Oh, don't you like it?"`
`"Uh, well... I don't hate it, but... it's just your breasts that are touching me, and..."`
`"My breasts bother you?`
` Hee hee hee hee!"`
`Keiichi Maebara was fun.`
`Mion thought the same way I did.`
`She would always talk about him.`
`I was happy for her. It made me smile.`
`"I guess Kei-chan is really your favorite,`
` huh, Sis?`
` What's the most interesting thing about him?"`
`"Ahahahaha... Let's see...`
`To put it plainly, he's just funny.`
` For example, just a couple of days ago in the club...!"`
`Mion really liked him, but didn't seem to think it was love yet.`
`She's reserved in that area, so that was really like her.`
`As for me, well,`
` I didn't hate him.`
`But my feelings weren't the same as Mion's.`
`Kei-chan was just too childish compared to Satoshi-kun.`
`.........I wondered how Satoshi-kun was doing...`
`Was he waiting for things to cool down somewhere far away...?`
`The case had already been solved, though. That dopehead was the murderer.`
`There was no reason for him to wait anymore...`
`I shook my head...`
` I shouldn't think about it too much.`
`Oh, wait. I know.`
`The case was confidential, so the arrest of the culprit hadn't been made public.`
`So, Satoshi-kun hadn't realized that he could come back.`
`...I know he's a little thickheaded.`
`Maybe he'd be waiting for things to calm down until the end of time.`
`...But if so... couldn't he give a call to Satoko at least?`
`He should tell her he's living in a faraway place,`
` but that he'd be coming home soon...`
`...Ahh... That stupid Satoko.`
`She'd been living with Rika Furude since Satoshi-kun went away.`
`So nobody would pick up the phone even if he called...`
` Stupid girl!`
` Don't you want your big brother to come home?`
`Given Satoshi-kun's personality...`
`He wouldn't remember any phone numbers other than his home number...`
` So, he wouldn't be able to contact anybody in Hinamizawa...`
`Maybe he's been calling Satoko every night. He keeps ringing, but nobody picks up...`
` Then he'd assume Satoko might be taking a bath, or be in the restroom...... `
`He'd put on a puzzled smile while mumbling "mmph..." like always...`
`"...Mmph..."`
`I imitated his voice without realizing it.`
`"After that...... Eh?`
` What?"`
`"Hmm?`
` What's up?"`
`"...Didn't you say something, Shion?"`
`I laughed it off and urged Mion to continue.`
`I realized then that her tone had changed.`
`I hadn't been listening to her because I was thinking about Satoshi-kun.`
`I'd thought she was still happily talking about Kei-chan.`
`......But Mion sounded grim now.`
`Her faint smile looked pitiful.`
`It was too late to ask what was going on.`
` So instead, I concentrated on her story instead.`
`"...After all that,`
` Uncle gave everybody a doll as a thank-you gift.`
` Everybody except for me."`
`"Okay,`
` except for you."`
`"Uh... I wanted one, too,`
` but... I couldn't say it in front of everybody......"`
`"You still can't express your needs, huh...?`
` And then?"`
`Mion sniffled.`
`...I realized that she was on the verge of tears.`
`"......The cutest doll was in Kei-chan's bag."`
`"And you wanted that doll?"`
`"...It didn't matter which one!`
` ...But although Kei-chan knew only I didn't get one, he didn't give it to me...`
` hic... he didn't give it to me...`
`He said the doll wouldn't fit me and...`
` that I should be born as a boy in my next life...`
` That's what he said... hic..."`
`"....................."`
`...That was Keiichi's weak point.`
`He might be fun and popular.`
`...But he wasn't mature......`
` not like Satoshi-kun.`
`"...I want to start all over...`
` I want to go back to when I just met him and start all over... I want him to treat me like a girl from the beginning..."`
`"Don't take it too seriously.`
` It'll be okay, because it's just you who wants to start over while he didn't even notice anything wrong.`
` It'd be harder if you guys fought over it or something."`
`"...Can I start over...?"`
`"If you didn't cry in front of him, it's not too late.`
` You can cry as much as you want now, and if you show him a different side of you from tomorrow on, you can still fix it."`
`".........Okay."`
`"I'm amazed how insensitive he is, but part of that is just the impression you've been giving him so far.`
` If you change your attitude from tomorrow on, you can still change his mind."`
`"How do I change my attitude...? How...?"`
`"...If I tell you to act cute, you'd start going to school in frilly clothes...`
` So don't think, and just be natural.`
` But, without overdoing it, pay attention to how you behave around him. `
`Ah, and don't forget to be cautious of Rena!`
` She's a bit ahead of you so far.`
` Kei-chan might prefer Rena at this point."`
`"......Ooh... it's true... Rena's really girly...`
` She's cute, and caring..."`
`"That just means you can't slack off for even a moment, Sis, because you've got a rival.`
` Tears can attract men, but they don't anchor them.`
` You should always be smiling, but cry when it really counts! `
`Hmm, that's how you typically do it...`
` Maybe I should try that on Kei-chan myself......"`
`"Eh, n-no, don't...!"`
`"Ahahahahahaha...!`
` He's the boy you like,`
` so I guess it's natural that I like him too.`
` Hmm, how can I attract him...?`
` Hey, Sis, why don't we have a competition over him?"`
`"No, no!`
` Never!!`
` I'll kick you into orbit if you come near Hinamizawa!!"`
`"Aha ha ha ha, aha ha ha ha!"`
`I'm happy for you, Sis.`
` It's not too late at all.`
`It's important to know the distance between the boy you love and yourself, and shift the way you appeal to him to compensate.`
`......The boy I love is......`
` missing, you know?`
`I don't even know where he is,`
` or when he's coming back.`
`Compared to that, you're very lucky.`
`Mion was saying she'd do her best from tomorrow on with red tearful eyes... but I sensed a deeply negative feeling emerging inside me.`
`Nobody was blaming Mion for`
` being happy with Keiichi.`
`I wasn't envious.`
`I wasn't jealous.`
`...I didn't want her to be blamed the same way I was blamed.`
`...It was just that there was no space for Satoshi-kun in Mion's mind anymore,`
` filled as it was with Kei-chan and her other friends now.`
`It didn't matter to her if Satoshi-kun came back`
` or not,`
` just like how she didn't care if it was sunny or rainy tomorrow.`
`What about me, then?`
`Had I been thinking about Satoshi-kun all the time for the past year...?`
`...I wasn't proud of my own answer.`
`...I'd become used to life without Satoshi-kun...`
`His absence didn't hurt me anymore...`
`...I was getting used to life with Keiichi Maebara...`
`And if I let my guard down...`
` he might just fill up the space I'd been saving for Satoshi-kun...`
`If Shion Sonozaki had prayed harder for Satoshi-kun to return, he might've come home already......`
`......Where did Satoshi-kun go...?`
`Last year, right after his disappearance, I'd paid close attention to the information circulating in the Sonozaki family and its underground connections, `
`and I frequently went to the police station to check with Ooishi for new information.`
`Even with all that, I couldn't get any new leads on his whereabouts.`
`......I eventually became interested in Oyashiro-sama's curse, which surrounded Satoshi-kun's disappearance...`
` I researched the dark history of the village...`
`......The more I looked into it, the less likely his survival seemed.`
`...I'd returned Miyo-san's scrapbooks to her.`
`...And then, I hadn't gone to the library since.`
`I started a new life in a new school.`
`...I'd made new friends.`
`.........And in the same way...`
` as falling leaves cover the ground...`
` I felt like I was losing sight of what was really important to me...`
`It was already almost the end of spring.`
`They said that summer was coming early, and it'd be very hot this year.`
`Normally it'd be the rainy season now, but we'd had no rain at all.`
`The Watanagashi festival was right around the corner.`
`It'd been almost a year... since Satoshi-kun went missing.`
`In Hinamizawa, they don't allow you to talk openly about Oyashiro-sama's curse, or the series of mysterious deaths.`
`......So, everybody acts like the murder of Satoshi-kun's aunt never happened.`
`That's because Satoshi Houjou-kun was a member of the family of traitors.`
`...He fell victim to Oyashiro-sama's curse on the fourth year running. He was demoned away.`
`...Everybody was trying to forget about his existence, and erase their memories of him...`
`Don't make him disappear because of the curse.`
`Don't erase his existence.`
`Satoshi-kun was living in Hinamizawa just a year ago.`
`He went to school.`
`He was an A student.`
`He was a member of the Hinamizawa Fighters. He could never hit the ball when it really mattered.`
`He was unreliable, but pure.`
` He was warm!`
`Because of the curse,`
` people made him disappear.`
` ......They stopped mentioning his name`
` and acted like he never existed.`
`.........A new resident like Keiichi Maebara`
` wouldn't even know him...`
`...He seriously believed that Satoshi-kun had transferred out...`
`I miss you, Satoshi-kun......`
`I want to go shopping with you again.`
`......I want to be in a baseball game with you again... and get a cold drink afterwards.`
`......I want to tease you, and... I want you to stroke my head again.`
`......Your hand was so warm......`
` I felt as if my whole body was being caressed.`
`............Satoshi-kun......`
