`I saw Miyo Takano a few times after that.`
`At her core, she was fascinated with the bizarre, and she had an insatiable curiosity that was just as strong.`
`I have to remind myself not to take her story too seriously.`
`...Otherwise...`
` I might start believing that Satoshi-kun disappeared because of the curse.`
`She talks about the dark history of Hinamizawa a lot. It's all very interesting.`
`Her theories are based on nothing but conjecture,`
` but some of her intuition covers facts that only members of the Sonozaki family would know.`
`She thinks that Oyashiro-sama's curse is the continuation of these ancient rituals.`
`In other words, she believes that the curse is performed by religious fanatics.`
`According to her theory, a religious cult once existed in Hinamizawa,`
` and the Three Families stemmed from it.`
`She believes that they are operating behind the scenes in order to revive the dignity of the Onigafuchi people, which was lost during the Meiji Era.`
`Miyo-san's theories are far-reaching, and looking at them on a larger scale, they end up making a lot of sense.`
`But they can't offer any explanation for Satoshi-kun's disappearance when using them on a smaller one.`
`Her theories are just too broad.`
