`Shion Sonozaki's last confession is dubious.`
`Did the hag convince her that the Sonozaki family had nothing to do with it?`
`Or is that the truth?`
`In my own investigations so far, I've proven there are aspects of the curse which can't be explained by the Sonozaki family alone.`
`So, my notes were all bogus from the beginning.`
`These two hundred pages are full of bullshit.`
`I thought of burning this notebook.`
`But I won't do it.`
`This notebook proves my guilt.`
`I won't distort the facts.`
`I won't burn it.`
`After all, my life was only a notebook long.`
`I wonder if anybody will read this.`
`If somebody does, please let them learn something from my stupidity.`
`The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa...`
`Dubbed 'Oyashiro-sama's curse.'`
`If you're reading this...`
`...Please find the truth.`
`That's`
` my only`
` wish.`
