`Do you think that murder can be justified, depending on the motive?`
`Hi, this is Ryuukishi07.`
`Thank you for playing Higurashi When They Cry Kai - Ch.5 Meakashi.`
`Although I depict many deaths in my work, I often ask myself a question.`
`That question is: is there such a thing as justifiable murder?`
`In our world, murder is prosecuted, and the degree of punishment varies depending on the motive and circumstances.`
`Having different degrees of punishment means that we are putting a value on the dead person's life.`
`Some scenes justify murder in 'Higurashi.'`
`By degrading the life of the victim in those scenes, the players can sympathize with the character more easily.`
`The degree of sympathy would be different from person to person.`
`The people who could sympathize probably felt catharsis, and the people who disagreed with the character might have felt uncomfortable.`
`That's indicated by how opinions were polarized regarding Keiichi's actions in Tatarigoroshi.`
`In Meakashi, there are also a number of murders.`
`But this time, the main character, Shion, tries to earn sympathy for each one of them.`
`How did you feel?`
`How much were you able to sympathize with her?`
`If you couldn't sympathize with her at all, then please berate her as a crazy murderer.`
`If you sympathized with her at all, then please have mercy on her.`
`If you sympathized with her almost entirely, then please have mercy on her.`
`If you completely sympathized with her, then please let us berate both of you as crazy murderers (lol).`
`What about me?`
`......Well, that's a secret.`
`I'd like to reverse my question this time...`
` What kind of murderer could you sympathize with, if you were to be killed?`
`A murderer who doesn't care about people's lives?`
`That'd be quite a regrettable death.`
`It's extremely sad to be killed in denial of all your values.`
`A murderer who begs for forgiveness in tears?`
`That'd be quite regrettable too.`
`They shouldn't kill you at all if they're begging your forgiveness, ha ha.`
`So, what kind of murderer could you sympathize with...?`
`In the end, 'sympathy' might be just a method for making the story more interesting.`
`If you can sympathize, it's fun.`
`If you can't sympathize, they're just crazy.`
`We cannot put value on human life.`
`It's a sin to even try doing so.`
`A murder is a murder.`
`Nothing more than that.`
`I just hope everybody can live happily together.`
`How does that sound?`
`Would you agree to that?`
`If you wouldn't`
`............ hee hee hee hee hee.`
`Thank you very much for playing Higurashi When They Cry Kai - Ch.5 Meakashi.`
`I could only bring out this fifth episode thanks to all of your support.`
`Higurashi will only get more intense as it approaches the finale.`
`Nothing would make me happier than if you continued reading the chapters to come.`
`The next chapter will be titled 'Tsumihoroboshi.'`
` Really, I'm rather fortunate if you've enjoyed yourself even a little.`
`Thank you again for playing.`
`I hope this has brought a little color to your life.`
`                               07th Expansion\n`
