`It took them a long time to come for me.`
`I had to wait until the following morning.`
`I opened the gate without checking who was ringing the doorbell.`
`I didn't even care who it was.`
`If it was the police, that'd be fine with me.`
`If it was Kei-chan... Ahaha... could he defeat me?`
`Keiichi and Rena were there.`
`"...Well, this is unusual.`
` ...Aren't you two going to school?"`
` "...We... stayed home today."`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...Kei-chan is one thing, but you too, Rena?`
` ...You two are such troublemakers."`
`I laughed.`
`".........Well, let's not just stand here.`
` Come on in."`
`I didn't think Rena would come.`
`I thought it would be either the police or Kei-chan alone.`
`I'll try tricking Kei-chan into coming with me to the underground storehouse.`
`Rena, why don't you try to figure out what I'm attempting to do and stop me?`
`You too, Kei-chan.`
` If you figured out I was Shion, why don't you try to figure out the rest?`
`I will act like a demon.`
`I will struggle until the very last moment.`
`So don't hold back.`
`Please don't hesitate to kill a filthy demon like me.`
`".........Mion.`
` ...First`
`......`
` I have something to apologize for."`
`".........You do?`
` ...What for?"`
`"...Well, on the night of Watanagashi.`
` ...The... ritual storehouse behind the shrine...`
` I went in there."`
`"............"`
`I didn't expect this to start with an apology.`
`Okay, so he admitted his sin of entering the ritual storehouse.`
`I guess that was manly of him.`
`I don't even care if the storehouse is forbidden anymore. Whatever.`
`That rule came from those who believed it was even a sacred place at all.`
`"......Mion.`
` ...You called Rika-chan and Satoko the day before last, didn't you?"`
`"............I don't remember doing so.`
` If you have a reason to think so, could you let me hear it...?"`
`"It was evening, before dinnertime.`
` ...Rika-chan should have come here.`
` Bringing a big bottle of soy sauce.`
` To have you share some with her."`
`Rena spoke with confidence.`
`She wasn't even trying to gauge my reaction.`
` She was simply telling me the truth.`
`...That cleverness was very pleasant to see.`
`".........Why do you think that?"`
`"...It's not hard to understand.`
` Mii-chan, you saw it too, didn't you?`
` Rika-chan's room."`
`"Hmm?`
` ...Mmm."`
`"......There was chilled tofu, but no soy sauce.`
` Plus, the big bottle of soy sauce that should have been under the sink was nowhere to be found."`
`"......Ahahahahaha.`
` What?`
` Is that why she would have come here?"`
`Rena sure is sharp.`
`I tried to beat around the bush, but she was confident in her conclusions.`
`She was cornering me.`
`She was doing such a great job, too. It really put me at ease.`
`Okay, demon.`
` Rena knows what she's talking about... What kind of excuse are you going to come up with now?`
`"......It's a long explanation, so I'll get to the point. ...The contents of that refrigerator... provided a vivid account of what you said over the phone when you lured her out."`
`There it is.`
` This game is over.`
`Rena...`
` I was right about you. I don't like you.`
`You really are just too sharp.`
`Shion is so obtuse that she never even recognized this side of you.`
`"............That's... ahahahahaha.`
` ...I had no idea I had such an incredible detective right next to me the whole time. `
`...I can't believe you'd figure out everything, down to the phone conversation... just from what was inside the fridge...`
` ......Ahahahahahahaha.`
` ...You've got me there. `
`You've got me, you've got me, ah-hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`I laughed like crazy.`
`I laughed because I was having so much fun.`
`I sensed the poison inside of my stomach dissipating, and felt free and refreshed.`
`"...Mion.`
` ......The police have suspected you for a long time now.`
`...Ooishi-san's officers have had the house under observation so that they could break in at any time."`
`Kei-chan was threatening me.`
` He was telling me I couldn't run or resist, so I should just surrender and accept my fate.`
`You aren't doing that intensely enough, Kei-chan.`
`Shouldn't you grab my collar and knock me to the ground?`
`Today is the day I'm prepared to die...`
`After that, they went easy.`
`Because they just wanted to know the reason why Mion committed such crimes.`
`...You all are being too lenient about this.`
`I'm a demon.`
` I'm a murderer.`
`Are you saying that if you can understand the reasoning, murder is okay?`
`A demon is a demon.`
`A murderer is a murderer.`
`Whether their motive is to have fun, to live, or to take revenge, that makes no difference.`
`Why do you even want to know that? Why don't you just tackle me and take me to the police?`
`Look, there.`
` The demon is trying to deceive you...`
`"......It's a pleasure to meet you both...`
` I am the successor of the Sonozaki family...`
` Mion.`
` ...Welcome to the Sonozaki family's house today.`
` I'd like to greet you on behalf of our leader, Oryou... `
`...You seem to want to ask various questions...`
` I'd like to answer everything as clearly as possible..."`
`I then told them about the strange events that led to Onigafuchi Village becoming Hinamizawa, which Takano-san had told me about before.`
`About half of it was the truth, but the other half was completely made up.`
`I just made it sound like it was only natural that their best friend committed such a gruesome crime.`
`Keiichi and Rena were both overwhelmed by the history of Onigafuchi Village, which was swallowed by this gloomy fate.`
`Oh, well...`
` I guess I made it sound interesting enough.`
`I'm sure they enjoyed hearing me tell the story.`
`But you know...`
`I'm the one who committed the incidents that happened in the present time.`
`What was the point in listening to those old folktales?`
`Are you thinking it will make your best friend's crime easier to swallow?`
`You're just trying to satisfy yourselves.`
`I'm a demon.`
` I'm a murderer.`
` I have sinned.`
`These old folktales have nothing to do with the crimes I've committed.`
`The way those two listened to me so intensely almost made it fun. I told them that people used to make canned human meat and conducted gruesome research during the war... `
`Those were things Takano-san told me.`
`Hey, you two...`
`Haven't you realized yet?`
`Haven't you realized that what I'm talking about has nothing to do with what we're dealing with right now?`
`...You both look so serious.`
` You two are such fools!`
`"...So that Hinamizawa Village might once more be like Onigafuchi Village. So that we may again be a sacred existence, worthy of worship. `
`That's the mission of those who inherit the 'demon' of the Sonozaki main family."`
`"......Those who inherit...`
` the demon?"`
`"......For generations, the Sonozaki family has had a custom of including the character for 'demon' in the names of its successors.`
` ...If you write out my name on your hand, it should appear plain as day..."`
`Keiichi tried to write 'Mion' on his palm.`
`"...Oh... She's right.`
` The character for 'demon' is in there..."`
`"......Not only in my name, either.`
` ...The demon is engraved on my body as well."`
`I stood up and made to show my bare back.`
`Of course, I don't actually have a tattoo there.`
`"It's okay, Mii-chan.`
` ......You don't need to show us, okay?"`
`"......Thank you."`
`I laughed a little.`
`...They must really believe that I'm their best friend, Mion.`
`My goodness.`
`The demon has won already.`
`They were doing so well at the beginning, too.`
`I eventually sat back down after I finished telling my made-up tearjerker stories.`
`It's your loss if you all shed any tears now.`
`I looked at Keiichi.`
` He wasn't crying, but he was overcome by emotion.`
`I looked at Rena.`
` ...Surprisingly, she still maintained an aggressive look, showing me her will to fight.`
`"But... Rika-chan and Satoko-chan`
`....................................`
` You killed them, didn't you, Mii-chan?"`
`You're good, Rena.`
`You know what I just told you isn't an excuse for murder.`
`You usually act like such a goofball, but that's not how you really are.`
`You sure are something.`
` You're far sharper than Shion.`
`"I'm not saying that it's okay if you killed other people.`
` ...Regardless, Mii-chan...`
` You killed Rika-chan and Satoko-chan."`
`".........I'm not trying to justify what I've done.`
` I have a demon inside of me.`
` The demon is in my name, in my body`
` and also in my soul.`
` ......But the demon wasn't the one who killed them. `
`I did. Mion Sonozaki did.`
` Rika-chan and Satoko died because Mion wanted them dead.`
` ...That will never change.`
` ...Hahaha. You're right, Rena."`
`Come on, Rena...`
` Try to figure out who I really am.`
`You still believe Shion, my victim, is the real culprit.`
`Poor Shion, I'm making Rena believe that you're responsible.`
`That was it for Rena, though.`
`She couldn't figure out I was Mion.`
`"Please,`
` turn yourself in."`
`Rena spoke to 'Mion.'`
`"We'll go with you.`
` ...We'll never leave a friend by herself."`
`".........Crying children and Rena are the only things I can't beat!`
` Ahahahaha..."`
`Too bad, Rena.`
` I've won.`
`"I'm well aware... of how serious my own crimes are.`
` ...Even if they accept me turning myself in... I'll probably never be able to come back here."`
`"............"`
`"So, I'd like you to hear one last selfish request."`
`"What is it?"`
`"Thirty minutes is fine...`
` Just let me have some time alone with Kei-chan."`
`"......Eh?"`
`Keiichi looked startled to suddenly hear his name.`
`You're so insensitive, Keiichi.`
` ...That's what made my sister cry.`
`"...Keiichi-kun...`
` is that okay with you?`
` ......If you don't want to, then I won't make you."`
`"............She's right.`
` It's okay if you don't want to.`
` ...After all, I'm a demon...`
` and Kei-chan is a bona fide human who moved here from somewhere else. `
`...For us to be compatible... as long as Oyashiro-sama doesn't exist to mediate... it simply isn't possible."`
`Keiichi hesitated a little.`
`Come on, Kei-chan, condemn me.`
`Condemn me, and tell me you'd never go.`
`"Sure.`
` ...It's fine."`
`".........Thank you."`
`...Fool!`
`"......I'd like to thank you too,`
` Keiichi-kun."`
`Rena stood up.`
`As promised, she made to leave.`
`"Ah, it's fine, Rena.`
` You can wait right here.`
` ...I just want to go around the garden with Kei-chan.`
` ...If you're bored, you can go to my room. You can read any manga you like. `
`......Ah, and if there are any volumes you want, you might as well take them."`
`"I don't want to.`
` Mii-chan's books belong to Mii-chan.`
` Rena couldn't bring them back home with her so freely."`
`".........You're such a good kid, only at times like this."`
`I took Rena's head and rubbed it like Satoshi-kun used to do to me.`
`"Okay... let's go,`
` Kei-chan."`
`The game was over.`
`Too bad, Rena.`
`At least this was more fun than if Kei-chan came alone.`
`If he did, he could have asked me to run away with him after hearing my stories.`
`Rena's eyes were like those of a judge.`
` In those eyes, I sensed both affection and observance.`
`I said thirty minutes, so she would probably only wait for thirty minutes.`
`If I took even a second longer, she'd call Ooishi.`
`I'm a little disappointed.`
`Rena still thinks I'm 'Mion.'`
` She didn't manage to see through me.`
`I thought someone like her would see the demon in me.`
` I guess I was wrong...`
` Too bad...`
`Keiichi followed me after putting his shoes on.`
`"Can I... hold your arm?"`
`......Such a humble request.`
`"...I don't mind."`
`I took Keiichi's arm.`
`It was as warm as Satoshi-kun's... I felt a little bewildered...`
`"...Do you get kind of nervous... with your arm through mine?`
` You're not thinking for example... that I'd suddenly put you in a world-class joint lock, or anything...?"`
`"...You two say the same things.`
` I don't think that.`
` At all."`
`He was remembering the time when I'd held his arm in town.`
`".........I think Shion liked you, Kei-chan."`
`"......I see."`
`I told him how my sister felt.`
`Shion was with Satoshi-kun for a long time, but what they had was friendship. They never had anything more than that.`
`That was why she fell in love with Keiichi.`
`If I were in her position, I would also have fallen in love with him.`
`If Shion was able to fall in love with him`
` then I could fall in love with him too.`
`Keiichi smiled gently.`
`I almost saw Satoshi-kun in that smile.`
`The Keiichi I knew was worthless and superficial.`
`I never realized he could smile like Satoshi-kun...`
`"...Mion and Shion... you got along well, didn't you...?"`
`"Well......... I wonder.`
` ...Kei-chan, do you think your right hand and left hand get along?"`
`"Huh?`
` My right hand and left hand?`
` ...I don't think you could describe them as getting along or not..."`
`"That's how our relationship is.`
` You can't measure it by how well we get along."`
`We'd been together since we were born.`
`We'd been living in this world as a pair.`
`But I was Mion and she was Shion.`
`Mion was treated specially... and I insisted on being her.`
`Of course, that was unpleasant for Shion.`
`Deciding to be fair, we switched places all the time.`
`We were probably different from other identical twins.`
`We didn't only like the same things or do things the same way.`
` We even managed to share our knowledge and experiences.`
`When we talked about our experiences, we could share them.`
`As Mion and Shion, we shared everything.`
`That was why each of us was both Mion and Shion at the same time.`
`No... maybe Shion was the only one who thought that way.`
`I was a little different than that.`
`I was simply letting Shion be Mion once in a while.`
`I was Mion, the successor to the Sonozaki family.`
`I was supposed to be treated specially.`
` I always thought that was my privilege.`
`Just like everyone tried to distinguish between Mion and Shion......`
` I also tried to distinguish between us.`
`"For example, one of your hands is dominant, so there will always be a better hand.`
` ...If you only had one oven mitt, you would put it on your dominant hand without thinking, right? `
`I think maybe it was like that for us."`
`"............"`
`"That doesn't mean, though, that anyone would be okay with losing their left hand.`
` ...It's that kind of unexplainable relationship."`
`"......I think that maybe... you lived too close together, and just stopped being able to see it, but...`
` I think that means you get along really well. `
`...I'm an only child, so... the day before the festival...`
` I was really jealous of when you and Shion were messing around with each other."`
`"...I think you're jealous of something that doesn't exist.`
` Yes, we twins used to have a lot of fun trading places with each other... `
`But now that we have such distinctly different personalities, our resemblance only gets in the way."`
`As an older sister, I felt I was mean for thinking that way... so as punishment, I became Shion.`
`......Who am I?`
`I never had a solid identity in the first place.`
`I was Mion.`
` Then I was Shion.`
`I should have just accepted that.`
`But something has changed.`
` ...I don't even know if I'm Mion or Shion anymore.`
`Had I really been stupid enough to hope that Rena would figure that out for me?`
`".........Shion is... still alive."`
`"...Really?"`
`Keiichi looked into my eyes.`
` I nodded quietly.`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...I'd been thinking to give her the most horrible death of all, so I kept her locked up.`
` ......I never did think of a good way to do it, though."`
`This was a lie.`
`I've already come up with ideas.`
` And I've already begun to execute them.`
`I dumped the hag into the well in front of Shion.`
` I dumped Kimiyoshi and Rika in there.`
` I even killed Satoko, too.`
`And right now, I'm plotting to kill Keiichi, who Shion fell in love with.`
`I am a demon.`
` Any such gruesome act is simply pleasure to me.`
`That's when I felt a warm hand rubbing my head.`
`It wasn't Satoshi's hand, but Keiichi's.`
`Keiichi and Satoshi-kun are totally different.`
` Why did Shion fall in love with him?`
`His rough hand didn't make me happy.`
`That he understood my feelings was just my imagination.`
`I wasn't happy, and it didn't feel good, it didn't...`
`".........Come with me.`
` ...I want you to see all of my sins.`
` ...Although, Kei-chan... it might be the worst thing you've ever seen."`
`I am going to commit my final crime.`
`I am going to let you see it.`
`I am going to let Shion see it.`
`When I do, are you still going to think I'm your best friend?`
`Poor Shion...`
`Kei-chan is going to die thinking it's you who's killing him.`
`".........If you want to turn back, now's your chance.`
` I don't know what impression you have of Mion Sonozaki, but...`
` it will surely change... once you go inside......`
`.................."`
`"It'll never change.`
` I'll say it as many times as I need to.`
` ...Mion Sonozaki is the best friend I could ever have."`
`You are such a fool.`
` You don't sound cool at all...`
`I don't understand human feelings because I'm now a demon,`
` but... I think I can understand why she loves you.`
`I opened the iron door to the underground storehouse and beckoned Keiichi inside.`
`Come on, Keiichi.`
` This is obviously a trap, don't you see?`
`This basement is transparently suspicious.`
` Don't you think you should run to the police?`
`But Keiichi was reckless.`
` ...He swallowed, then stepped inside.`
`.........Hah.`
` You really are... a fool.`
`We went down the stairs to the basement, and I let him into the torture room.`
`Everyone is shocked their first time visiting this room.`
`...I used to be that way.`
`...Of course, Keiichi looked surprised too.`
`...But he was trying not to show it.`
`Obviously he wanted to express his shock at seeing this horrifying room.`
` But... he also knew that if he voiced that shock, that he would be rejecting his best friend, who was trying to confess her sins to him...`
`...So he did everything he could to stifle his surprise.`
` "...According to something a family head from a long time ago wrote...`
` Blood splatter has impact, despite the fact that it doesn't tax the sacrifice. `
`...Watanagashi was meant as a deterrent, after all.`
` My ancestors thought up all different kinds of showy torture.`
` ......That's a space for the audience.`
` ...Watanagashi is a deterrent, after all.`
`It wouldn't make sense if there were no guests."`
`".................."`
`Keiichi smiled quietly as he listened to me.`
` No matter what cruelty came out of my mouth...`
`He would embrace me.`
`Was this really the superficial Keiichi Maebara I knew? `
`"Right here... .........is where I killed everyone.`
` ...There were no spectators to watch me... but I held a Watanagashi of my own. `
`...Well, perhaps there was one spectator."`
`"...Huh?`
` A spectator...?"`
`"...Me.`
` I, the demon, was watching the entire time Mion held the ceremony."`
`I started to laugh.`
`How many hints do you need, Keiichi? When are you going to figure out I'm not really your best friend?`
`Come on, hurry up... you're running out of time. The game is... almost over.`
`This was a game.`
`This was a game of murder. I had killed people, using my revenge for Satoshi-kun as an excuse.`
`The demon was trying to capture Keiichi and kill him before Mion's eyes.`
`But Keiichi had a chance.`
`If he figured out I wasn't his best friend, then he'd win.`
`If not, he was out.`
`When did I come up with that rule?`
`I guess it was sometime today.`
` Or did I come up with it just a minute ago?`
`Since the two of them aren't too bright, I decided to be easy on them, I guess.`
`You are Mion's best friends, right?`
`Don't you believe in her?`
`Have you already made Mion into a murderer within yourselves?`
`Why don't you try to protect the Mion within you?`
`Why don't you try to believe your friend can't be a murderer?`
`If you could believe until the very end, like Satoko did...`
`You would have realized I wasn't Mion, your best friend, but just someone who looks like her.`
`But if you can't, if you still believe that I'm Mion...`
`Then you're just like me.`
`I killed the Satoshi-kun within me so easily, and you will do the same. You don't deserve to live.`
`"Back there is the prison."`
`"...Is Shion there...?"`
`You're not going to make it.`
`Once we reach Shion's cell, your time is up.`
` The demon will win.`
`".........Shion?!`
` .........Is that Shion?!?!"`
`"Ke... Kei-chan?!`
` Is that you, Kei-chan?!"`
`Keiichi ran to the cell.`
`"Are you all right, Shion?!`
` Are you hurt...?!"`
`"...N...... no...... no.........`
` nooooooooooooooooo!!!!"`
`Shion screamed.`
`I was standing right behind Keiichi.`
`...It was time.`
` My preparations to kill the boy she loved were complete. For her, this was going to be the worst possible torture.`
`"Calm down, Shion.`
` ...Everything is over now.`
` Everything."`
`Keiichi tried to quell Shion's distress by talking to her in a calm voice.`
`It was such a funny sight.`
`Keiichi was the only one who had no idea what was going on.`
`"Shion.`
` ...How have you been...?"`
`"No more... please...!`
` No more!!`
` I don't want to see anyone else die!!!`
` If you hate me... then just kill me already!!!`
` I'm the one you hate most, right?!`
` Kill me, kill me right now!!`
` Siiiiiiiiiiiiis!!!!"`
`"C... Calm down, Shion!`
` It's all over now.`
` ...It's going to be alright.`
` So calm down..."`
`"Relax.`
` I won't kill you.`
` ...No, I won't kill you just yet.`
` Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...!!"`
`It's game over!!!`
`I gave you enough chances.`
`You cornered me quite well, once.`
`But that was it.`
`You couldn't figure out that I'm not your best friend, Mion.`
`You couldn't believe that Mion isn't a murderer.`
`"Please stoooooop!!!`
` Don't kill Kei-chaaaaan!!`
` Kei-chan has nothing to do with this, does he?!`
` If you're going to kill someone... then kill me right now!!!`
` I don't want anyone else... to dieeeeeeeee!!!!"`
`"Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!`
` If you want to die that badly, then after I've killed this man, I'll take my time making mincemeat out of you. `
`...In accordance with the ancient rites, I'll do it slowly, starting with your extremities.`
` I'll shave you down and mince you to bits.`
` I had that mincing machine set up specifically for you, after all. `
`...Or would it be funnier if I were to mince up Kei-chan in front of you?"`
`"...H-Hey, quit it already!`
` What do you have to gain by scaring her at this point...?!"`
`"Nooooo!`
` Kei-chan, run awaaaaayyyyyy!!!"`
`Here you are, demon.`
`Go ahead and take my soul.`
`I'd been living my life to avenge Satoshi-kun...`
`But that wasn't what he wanted from me.`
` That was just for my own satisfaction.`
`I couldn't even face Satoshi-kun.`
`So, I'll bring this to an end in the way I want.`
`The world became a total mess.`
`Satoshi-kun hates me and I hate myself too.`
`I'm going to complete my revenge.`
`I don't want anyone to sympathize with me.`
`I won't pretend to be some tragic heroine either.`
`I'm going to become a murderer that nobody could sympathize with.`
`So please...`
` Grant a suitable final moment to me...`
`A bluish-white flash filled the huge cave.`
`Keiichi fell down like a doll.`
`Shion reached out to him from the other side of the bars.`
`She screamed at me not to kill Keiichi.`
`Go ahead, cry and blame me.`
`Don't even think of offering your forgiveness.`
`I am the most rotten existence in this world.`
`So please, grant me the worst possible ending.`
`Shion begged me desperately to let Keiichi go. I simply abused her,`
` slandered her,`
` and disgraced her.`
`The more Shion suffered, the deeper I'd fall into Hell.`
`It wasn't enough.`
` It wasn't even close to deep enough.`
`It wasn't deep enough to compensate for my sins.`
`I dragged Keiichi to the table that I tried to put Satoko on, and restrained him there.`
`Keiichi began to move sluggishly.`
`The stun gun must have not worked too well on him.`
`"Can you hear it, Shion!?`
` I'm going to get started now!!`
` Savor Kei-chan's fresh screams to your heart's content!!"`
