`"...Kei-chan, are you serious?`
` I'm going to get really mad if this is a joke."`
`I scolded Keiichi for suspecting that Rika had disappeared.`
`"Mii-chan.`
` If it really is a joke, don't get mad, smile.`
` It would be a joke, after all.`
`...We need to go make sure whether it's a joke or not."`
`"......You're right.`
` ...Sorry for getting upset."`
`Rena rebuked me.`
`While she looked quiet, I felt that she could be very terrifying under her skin.`
` I had no basis for that impression, but I still felt that way...`
`I just didn't like her. I had disliked her ever since that rainy day at the bus stop.`
`It wasn't that we didn't get along, though.`
`How should I put it?`
` ...I was at a loss for how to explain.`
`Ah...`
` that was it.`
` I found a good example.`
`When I was little, I always wanted to play tennis.`
`I had my relatives take me to a tennis court, and they all praised my skill.`
`I was doing nothing more than hitting a ball with a racket.`
` But they told me I was talented, and that made me happy.`
`When I went to school, I told my classmates I played tennis, and they told me that I was talented too.`
`Then...`
` one of my classmates, who was usually very quiet, said she also played tennis.`
`Not only did she play, but she took lessons.`
` Although I'd bragged about my serve, I was no match for her.`
`I felt lonely and insulted that everyone was paying attention to her and not me.`
`She was usually very quiet`
` but suddenly, I realized that she knew more and had a lot more experience than me.`
`Rena at the bus stop was just like that.`
`I thought of myself as a demon now.`
`I'd awakened a part of me that was half human and half demon, the part that lived in Onigafuchi Village.`
`In fact, I'd already stepped into a world where normal humans couldn't go.`
`I'd already surpassed my human limits.`
`I genuinely thought of myself as a superior being, having transcended the realm of mortals.`
`But... when my eyes met with Rena Ryuugu's, `
` I felt what I did long ago, with tennis.`
`...Why?`
`Why did I feel that way with Rena?`
`I'd heard that in the animal world, during battle, animals glare at each other to display their strength.`
`Only humans have to punch or kick each other to feel superiority or inferiority.`
` Most animals can tell just by glaring at each other.`
`In that case...`
` Could it be the same with Rena...?`
`"Mii-chan, are you okay?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Ah, ah, yeah, sorry!`
` I haven't slept since yesterday, y'know... Sorry..."`
`Keiichi climbed up a ladder and tried to peek into the window on the second floor where Rika and Satoko lived.`
`It was my job to hold down the ladder.`
` Rena cautioned me to hold onto it tightly.`
`"Mii-chan, I'm going to go check the main house just to be sure, okay?`
`I'll be right back!"`
`"A-Ah, okay.`
` Be careful!"`
`Rena ran off after that.`
`When I looked up, I saw Keiichi trying to open a window, but all of them were locked.`
`"...What did Rena mean by 'main house'?"`
`Keiichi asked me from the top of the ladder.`
`"It's the Furude family's actual house.`
` After her parents passed away, I think it's been left like that."`
`"....Ah... right.`
` ...Rika-chan's parents... they passed away, huh?"`
`"Satoko's also an orphan.`
` ...Her parents fell from a cliff because of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ...Then her older brother, Satoshi-kun... he disappeared..."`
`"...Satoshi... I've heard that name before."`
`He'd heard the name before?`
` I felt anger growing inside of me.`
`Don't you know whose desk you're using every day? You act as if it belongs to you.`
` You drop food on it while eating lunch.`
` You drool on it while taking a nap... Don't you know who it really belongs to?`
`....Why am I acting this way? I'm Mion.`
`Satoshi-kun doesn't even exist anymore.`
`...He was demoned away. It's hardly Keiichi's fault that he didn't know.`
` It really isn't his fault...`
`"Satoko and Rika-chan have been living in this shack ever since.`
` Neither of them has any family, but at least they're together.`
` ...They help each other out."`
`"...Didn't Rena say there was a main house?`
` Wouldn't it be easier to live there...?"`
`"I think she tried that at first.`
` ...She said it was hard, though, because it reminded her of her parents."`
`After everyone in Satoko's family died, she started living with Rika.`
`It only made sense.`
` Satoko and Rika were best friends.`
`They didn't care about the Houjou family or the Furude family. They had been best friends since before the dam conflict.`
`The reason why the curse never fell upon Satoko...`
`Rika Furude probably had a lot to do with it.`
`That made more sense than anything else, at least.`
`Satoko was pardoned from the curse of the Houjou family.`
` All thanks to Rika Furude's arrangements!`
`Satoko had never been a victim on the night of Watanagashi.`
`According to the curse system I'd uncovered,`
` the last survivor of the Houjou family still living in Hinamizawa would be the perfect target for this year's curse.`
`Therefore, whoever was responsible for executing the curse must have tried to take her life.`
`However, nothing happened to her...`
`Proving that Satoko had escaped from the curse.`
`......That was really and truly infuriating.`
`She might have been the head of the Furude family, but I still couldn't accept that such a little girl had enough power to protect her best friend.`
`Mion, no, actually Shion... Shion must have had the same power, then!!`
`Just like Rika protected Satoko, Shion could have protected Satoshi!!`
` Damn it, damn it...`
`"...Rika-chan`
`......`
` and Satoko-chan...`
` they have it hard, huh."`
`"She's cursed."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"...Mion...`
` what...`
` did you`
` just say?"`
`"I said, she's cursed."`
`"...Mi... Mion, you... Why are you making that face...?"`
`"Satoko Houjou...`
` ...She's been cursed by Oyashiro-sama."`
`I can't accept that Satoko was pardoned from the curse although she was a member of the cursed Houjou family.`
`She was one of the cursed Houjous!!`
`Satoshi-kun wasn't pardoned, but Satoko was!!`
`She was cursed, but she got away!!`
` She escaped the curse, but Satoshi-kun didn't... I can't accept that!!`
`In fact, Satoko should have been the one to be cursed the most!!`
`She cornered Satoshi-kun physically and emotionally!`
`That was why things got weirder and weirder, and in the end, everything went crazy.`
`When I think back on it, it was Satoko who I hated most of all!!`
`She cornered Satoshi-kun,`
` *****************************`
` and as a result,`
` Satoshi-kun disappeared!!`
` She started it.`
` She caused it!!`
` If only she hadn't been there!! `
`Just as Rika Furude and Satoko had lived happily... maybe there had been a happy future for me too.`
` Maybe Satoshi-kun and I could have started our lives together in Okinomiya!! `
`Yes, if I look at both the beginning and the end, it's so obvious!`
` Satoko's existence caused everything. `
`Satoshi-kun had to kill his aunt because of Satoko, the Three Families used that need to create the curse, and then they killed him!!!`
`...The police were convinced he just ran away, but he'd never do that.`
`He was the type of person who always did his best at everything...`
`All by himself.`
`He was doing the very best he could for his only sister, yet he was forced to vanish.`
`He worked so hard for Satoko!`
`And though he was living just for her, he was erased.`
`Poor Satoshi-kun.`
` He was so underappreciated.`
`That girl knew no gratitude.`
` ...She was cursed.`
`If you got near her, you'd meet the same fate.`
`You'd be cursed to die`
` or disappear.`
`That really was it: she was the main cause behind it all.`
` She wormed her way into Rika Furude's good graces, and that was why the curse fell upon Satoshi-kun.`
` She should have died first. `
`Then Satoshi-kun would be still alive.`
` If he was alive, I could have done something for him!!`
`I can't forgive her.`
` I can't forgive Satoko.`
` I can't forgive that girl.`
` There can be no peace with her,`
` there can be no peace...`
`<i>She</i> was the perfect target for the curse of 1983.`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
` ...Rika Furude, the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Rika was dead.`
`The reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama had died.`
`There was no more god in Hinamizawa to deliver the curse.`
`I'm the one who has to deliver it now!`
`I am Mion Sonozaki, the head of the Sonozaki family, one of the Three Families of Onigafuchi!!`
`Now that all the heads of the three families are gone, there is nobody to surpass me.`
`I will deliver the curse of Oyashiro-sama, and nobody else!`
`I'll deliver it.`
` I am the curse.`
`I have become Oyashiro-sama!!`
`I felt hot bubbles boiling over deep inside of me.`
`I could tell the demon inside of me wanted to roar.`
`...I noticed Keiichi was looking down at me.`
`Calm down, Mion.`
` He can't tell what you're thinking.`
` Calm down, calm down.`
`At that point, I heard footsteps coming closer.`
`I saw four or five adults, accompanied by Rena, running toward us with flashlights in their hands.`
`One of them opened the lock on the cabin door, and we all went inside.`
`Of course, there was nobody there.`
`Satoko and Rika lived alone.`
`I doubted Satoko would have left a note saying she was going over to the Sonozaki house when Rika was there already.`
`But it wouldn't be fun if she had.`
`Because of that, I hurried into the room ahead of Rena to make sure there was nothing left behind.`
`The rumor of Rika and Satoko's disappearance spread around the village quickly. More and more villagers gathered at the Furude Shrine.`
`Acting in place of the head of the Sonozaki family, I commanded them to search the village.`
`The villagers nodded and scattered.`
`How long had it been since the last time I was truly Mion?`
`I felt so pleased that my body almost went numb...`
`Lots of villagers went in and out of the shrine.`
` They yelled at each other that she was nowhere to be found.`
` Some suggested other places to look`
` and they all left.`
` They made a lot of noise with their comings and goings.`
`Members of the women's association brought out huge pots and gas cookers from the storage and got ready to cook for the men.`
`That was when I noticed Keiichi unsteadily walking toward a copse of dark pine trees.`
`What was he thinking? How stupid of him to be alone on a night like this.`
`If a person responsible for executing the curse was nearby, he wouldn't come back safely...`
`"Mion-chan, we went all around Ojaga Lake, but didn't find anything.`
` We tried to light up the pond, but we're going to have to wait until the sun is up."`
`"Okay, thanks for your hard work.`
` The women are making some miso soup, so please rest up and have some."`
`"Mion-chan, do you know where they usually park their bicycles?"`
`"No...`
` They probably parked them at the bottom of the stairs leading up here.`
` I don't think they'd come up while carrying them."`
`"We can't find their bicycles.`
` Where did they go...?"`
`"If they left on their bikes,`
` they could have gone pretty far...`
` Maybe even as far as the town..."`
`"In that case, we'll have to look outside of Hinamizawa..."`
`"By the way, who first noticed that Rika-chama was gone?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Ah, it was Kei-chan.`
` He suddenly had a hunch...."`
`"Oh, that Maebara kid, huh?`
` Mmmm, he's a little suspicious."`
`"Speaking of which, why hasn't the Maebara family shown up when we're in a crisis like this?"`
`"The Maebaras still haven't joined the town council, so they're not in the youth group's phone directory."`
`"Really? Well, ain't no helping it then."`
`"Huh?`
` They joined, didn't they?`
` I think it's just that their name isn't in the directory yet...`
` The last time we updated it was at the beginning of the year.`
` They just moved here, so that's why they aren't on it."`
`"That Maebara kid's hunch is still suspicious."`
`"They do say the first one on the scene is the most suspicious."`
`"Where did he go?"`
`"I saw him walking toward the pine trees.`
` Can someone go get him?"`
`Conveniently, I saw Keiichi and Rena walking back toward us.`
`"...Kei-chan, where did you go?`
` I was worried you'd disappeared too!"`
`".........Sorry..."`
`It looked like nothing had happened to Keiichi.`
`If so, that's fine.`
`That means I took care of all of my enemies.`
`"...Oh, my, my, my...!`
` I knew I smelled something good coming from over here.`
` I'd be much obliged if you'd allow me to have some."`
`I heard the loud, sticky voice of a middle-aged man.`
`It was Ooishi.`
`He must be confused about this year's incident.`
`The scale of the curse this time is nothing like the previous ones.`
`Ooishi's information network is about equal to or better than that of the elders on the town council.`
`In other words, he could easily uncover a rumor that was circulating through the underside of the village.`
`He must've came here to see if the disappearances of Kimiyoshi and Rika had something to do with the changing of the lock on the ritual storehouse's door.`
`The police will come for me sooner or later.`
`I am Mion Sonozaki.`
`By removing all of the heads of the Three Families, my enemies, I have become the head in their place.`
`I can't allow Mion Sonozaki to continue existing.`
`I'll have to destroy the existence of the head of the Sonozaki family.`
`When I destroy my own position, that is when my revenge will come to an end.`
`More than likely, I'll have Ooishi witness my final moments.`
`My eyes and Ooishi's met.`
`...Damn it, he thinks I'm suspicious already.`
`You're right, Ooishi.`
` I did it.`
` Mion Sonozaki, the head of the Sonozaki family, is the culprit.`
` ...Heh, heh, heh!!`
