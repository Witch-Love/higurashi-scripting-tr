`"But... I've been living in Okinomiya all my life!`
` Since the hag hated me, I've barely been to Hinamizawa!`
` Besides, I was stuck at school.`
` How would I know about any of that?!"`
`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And, well... I had a bit."`
`Gulp.`
` I pretended to drink with an invisible glass.`
`"A-Are you hung over?!`
` How old are you?!"`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be sleeping in today with a hangover, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` My sis had a hangover?`
` Ah hahahaha!`
` That's so like her~~!"`
