`"Good evening."`
`"Good evening."`
`Rika smiled at me. She was holding a huge soy sauce bottle.`
`She acted like I never yelled at her, got violent with her, or made her cry at all today.`
`Or perhaps she came to curry favor, thinking that she angered me.`
`I invited Rika to the front door. I told her to wait for a moment, and tried to take the bottle.`
`But Rika took her shoes off and walked into the house with the bottle in her hands.`
`"Don't worry, I'll get it for you. Why don't you wait there?"`
`"......I'm pretty good at pouring soy sauce into a funnel, you know...?"`
`She looked at me as if begging.`
`I guess she wanted to pour the soy sauce into the bottle herself.`
`I didn't want her to come in the house,`
` but I suppose I didn't want her to wait there alone either.`
`If she came to the kitchen with me, I could keep my eyes on her.`
`And so, I brought Rika to the kitchen.`
`We walked down the hallway.`
`I only heard my footsteps.`
`I stopped suddenly and turned around to make sure Rika was following me.`
`Rika bumped into me.`
`"...Meep."`
`"Mmm, ah, sorry."`
`I made sure she was right behind me and started to walk again.`
`Tap, tap, tap.`
`Tip, tip, tip.`
`Tap,`
` tap...`
` Tip,`
` tip.`
`Rika must have been having fun matching her footsteps to mine.`
`Even when I quickly sped up, our footsteps matched perfectly.`
`Tap, tap,`
` tap, tap.`
`Tip, tip,`
` tip, tip.`
`Tap, tap, tap.`
` I stopped suddenly.`
`Tip, tip, tip.`
` Tip.`
` Rika stopped suddenly too, after taking an extra step.`
`When I turned around, Rika smiled at me.`
`Our footsteps matched perfectly, and when I stopped suddenly, I heard her extra step.`
`I've experienced such footsteps before... it was making me feel uncomfortable.`
`But now, although her footsteps sounded the same as the other ones I'd experienced, I saw her when I turned around.`
`That was the difference between them.`
`I left the storage door open, so we could see the soy sauce barrel.`
`The memo said she can take as much as she wants, but I wasn't sure there was enough left.`
`I crouched down and tried to open the lid of the soy sauce barrel.`
`Even when I crouched down, I could hear Rika's extra step.`
`"Good, there's plenty left.`
` Take as much as you want."`
`When I turned around, Rika was very close to me.`
`But... eh?`
` ...Who was this?`
` I saw Rika... but it wasn't Rika at all...`
`It was like when I switched with my sister.`
`The outside was the same, but the inside was different.`
`Did Rika have a twin sister?`
`I was confused for a moment.`
`That was when Rika sprayed something from a small bottle into my eyes.`
`"Huh?!`
` Hhnnnnn!!!"`
`I felt a terrible pain in my eyes, and suddenly tears poured out and my nose started to run.`
`I couldn't stop sneezing either.`
`As I stumbled around, covering my face, I then realized I was attacked.`
`I shut my eyes tightly for a moment, then opened them again.`
` Rika was about to grab my hair to drag me down onto the floor.`
`When Rika saw me open my eyes, she sprayed at me again.`
`I shut my eyes to avoid the spray, but my nose still breathed in the substance.`
` I avoided the pain in my eyes, but the tears, the runny nose, and the sneezing continued.`
`Shiiit, aaaah!!`
`My brain isn't working quickly enough!`
`However, when I finally understood that I had been attacked by Rika Furude...`
`My brain started to grind into motion.`
`Rika Furude knocked me on my back and got on top of me.`
`I tried to escape from her by rolling on the kitchen floor.`
`As I rolled, I hit an oven,`
` a huge jar,`
` and destroyed a pile of something on the floor as I fought back.`
`But Rika didn't let go of me.`
` She stayed on top`
` and restrained me.`
`She was sitting on my stomach, and I felt intense pain and pressure.`
`She sure could fight well...`
`I still couldn't see anything.`
`Rika had the upper hand, my eyes were shut, and I was in real danger.`
`As I tried to blink, I saw Rika's expression.`
`I didn't know Rika Furude all that well.`
`I only knew her from the few times we met when I went to school as Mion, and from the things I've heard from other people.`
`But as far as I knew, there was no way Rika Furude would ever do something like this.`
`This is just impossible. Impossible, impossible!`
`No, I can't fill my head with that word!`
`I have to calm down and figure out what to do next...`
`Shit, I'm too much of a mess to even think!`
`I tried to peek at her face again.`
`She still had the spray bottle in one hand.`
` What I didn't expect was the thing in her other hand.`
`How could I mistake it for anything else?`
`It was definitely`
` a syringe.`
`When Rika realized I'd regained my eyesight,`
` she pointed the spray bottle right at me and let loose with it.`
`I shut my eyes tightly and tried to ignore the pain.`
`But that was when, even though I was blinded,`
` Rika made a miscalculation.`
`She had sprayed at me from such a close distance that she inhaled the substance as well.`
`I heard Rika sneeze, and realized that it was my chance.`
`Even if I couldn't see, I knew she was right there.`
`I hit Rika's face a few times.`
` When I felt Rika's weight shift, I escaped.`
`I then got my stun gun ready.`
`Rika must have inhaled just a little of the spray. She wasn't sneezing anymore, and was glaring at me instead.`
`"...Hey, hey, hey... Are you pickin' a fight with me?`
` You want me to wreck you?!!!"`
`Rika's expression didn't change, but I was sure she was disappointed that her surprise attack was a failure.`
`Rika flinched just a little`
` but she was still holding the spray bottle and aiming it at my eyes.`
`She was trying to use the spray first`
` and then give me the shot.`
`I didn't know what was in that syringe, but it was a clear liquid.`
`It had to be something bad.`
`She wanted to take my eyesight, get on top of me, and then give me the shot.`
`If whatever was in the syringe took a while to take effect`
` I might have the chance to fight back`
` and seriously injure Rika.`
`But Rika's surprise attack told me that just being injected was more than enough.`
`In other words, whatever the effect,`
` it would start to work immediately.`
` Therefore, I wouldn't be able to fight back against her.`
`It'd probably either knock me out or kill me.`
`In any case, what I had was equally deadly.`
`My stun gun was very powerful.`
` Just one shot would be all it took.`
`What happened before was proof of its power.`
`"....................."`
`Rika knew my stun gun was a lot more powerful than her spray. She was being extremely cautious.`
`"Hey, what do you think you're doing in my house, huh?`
` If you aren't moving, then I'll come to you!!!"`
`I threw a pile of newspapers at her.`
`The pile wasn't tied together, so the newspapers flew all over Rika.`
`I jumped at her immediately after.`
`I shoved my stun gun into her,`
` and pulled the trigger!!!`
`Rika spasmed and fell to the floor.`
`...You fool!`
` Hesitating in a fight where a single blow wins!`
` Only amateurs just glare at each other.`
` You don't have a single clue about how advantageous the first strike is when a single blow can decide everything!`
`The spray bottle rolled on the ground,`
` but she still had the syringe.`
`Rika was down, but I couldn't let my guard down either.`
`I kicked her in the side and clambered on top of her.`
`I took the syringe.`
`I held Rika's arm down and gave her the shot.`
`My actions could hardly be called gentle.`
`I injected her violently.`
`I injected everything that was in the syringe.`
`Rika began to convulse.`
`I stood back and watched for what would happen to her body.`
`Of course, I still had my guard up.`
`While I assumed that the drug would incapacitate her immediately, I didn't know exactly what kind of reaction she would have.`
`"Ha, ha!`
` Look at you!!`
` Did you really think you could defeat me?`
` Think again!!!"`
`After a few more convulsions, Rika unsteadily got to her feet.`
`...That's ridiculous. How can she even stand?`
`I looked at my stun gun.`
`Damn it!`
` The power was on the lowest setting!`
`Maybe it had been readjusted when we were rolling around on the floor...`
`I changed the setting to maximum.`
`Rika turned pale and started sweating all over.`
`...I didn't know its exact effects, but if Rika had given me the shot, I'd be the one experiencing her symptoms.`
`She looked really sick, so obviously she must've been feeling awful too.`
`She couldn't even focus. She was very wobbly, and had her hand on the wall.`
`She'd lost her balance, and it must've been hard for her to even stand.`
`She didn't look so brave anymore.`
`Rika wobbled some more and moaned as if she was about to throw up.`
`"Ooh`
` hah, hah...`
`.........`
` Ahoo, ahooo...`
` Hanyuuu...`
` Hanyuuu...`
` cough`
` cough!`
` Cough!!"`
`Rika looked scary as she moaned and wobbled, but at the same time, she looked kind of funny too.`
`...Certainly, she hadn't even dreamed she'd be getting the shot herself.`
` As the man sows, so shall he reap.`
` That's what you get.`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha!`
` This is funny, so funny.`
` But please don't throw up here, go to the bathroom, okay?`
` Heh heh heh!`
` I'm going to enjoy how long it'll take for you to die. `
`Oh, but that means I can't torture you later, huh?`
`I've been planning to use the nail table on you.`
` So either you choke on your own vomit and die, or I pound nails into all ten of your fingers. Hmm, I wonder which it will be...`
` Okay, I know. `
`Let's move to the underground shrine storage.`
` I'll put you to sleep so I can move you there, okay?`
` Heh heh heh!!"`
`I walked up to Rika, my stun gun making popping sounds.`
`When Rika saw the sparks from the stun gun,`
` she moved to grab a huge kitchen knife.`
`"Oh, are you still trying to fight?`
` Heh heh heh!`
` That makes things more fun.`
` I have so much I want to ask you.`
` I would suggest you back down. `
`Well, actually, even if you do, you'll go through the same misery anyway, heh heh heh!"`
`"......Sorry, but I'll refuse that invitation, you torture maniac."`
`What she said wasn't anything I'd expect to hear from the Rika I knew.`
`But I didn't hesitate.`
`I had the advantage, so I didn't need to worry.`
`Besides, this was coming from the last survivor of the Furude family, one of the Three Families.`
`That sudden change somehow felt natural.`
`"Compared to what the Three Families have done, this is nothing.`
` Thank you for that high praise, though.`
` I should be proud of myself, huh?`
` So? `
`Are you seriously thinking about fighting me with a knife in that condition?`
` You can't even stand straight..."`
`"......You're right.`
` Like you said, I'm at my limit.`
` ...But if that means getting captured and tortured to death by you, then sorry, I'm taking my leave."`
`"Taking your leave?`
` Pfft, try it if you can!!"`
`It was clear who held the advantage here.`
`But despite that, an odd thrill filled both of us.`
`'We lost our minds' wasn't a fitting phrase for the people of Hinamizawa.`
`It was a feeling of release, when modern demons could stop pretending to be human.`
`Yes, this... was a mad banquet of demons, with the savoring of blood and devouring of flesh.`
`Attended by the head of the Furude family and the head of the Sonozaki family, the old families whose blood is closest to the madness of the demons.`
`I stood in front of the hallway so as to block her escape route.`
`The windows had grates and the door had a safety chain on it. If she turned around, I'd hit her with my stun gun.`
`In this situation, what did Rika Furude mean by 'taking her leave'?`
`Rika got her knife ready.`
`I expected her to aim at my stomach when she attacked, so I took a stance with my stun gun ready in my hand.`
`Rika, however, suddenly turned around.`
`I carefully watched to see what her next move would be.`
`Rika put the handle of the knife to the wall and held it in place.`
` ...What was she doing?`
`"......Goodbye, torture maniac.`
` I won't give you the satisfaction of killing me."`
`Rika reared her head back and slammed her throat against the knife on the wall...!!`
`"...!!!`
` .........!!!"`
`Her blood splattered all over.`
`Rika bent backwards repeatedly and let the knife slash at her throat.`
` Again, and again.`
`Her neck and chest were dyed red.`
` I'd always thought blood was darker.`
`But her blood wasn't dark. It was so bright... I must have been confused, but... it looked pretty...`
`After doing this several times`
` Rika turned around.`
`Her eyes were wide open. She didn't look like she was from this world.`
`Her face looked like something both living and dead, both real and artificial.`
` ...It was very scary, eerie...`
` and above all else, pale.`
`Although her face looked unearthly, it was a very appropriate face for a demon.`
`I didn't have a mirror so I couldn't tell,`
` but I was sure I looked exactly like her.`
`Rika continued to violently slash her throat.`
`It reminded me of someone trying to break a huge piece of ice with an ice pick.`
`That was exactly what Rika looked like.`
`The white chips of ice coolly flying through the air.`
`What I saw before me was a beautiful sight.`
`Every time Rika struck her throat, tiny drops of red blood splattered the boring white world around her.`
`It was like a dance.`
`A dedication dance by the final head of the Furude family.`
`The demon's last dance of dedication to Oyashiro-sama.`
`Upon seeing that literally bloodcurdling dance, I let out a fierce roar.`
`I had no reason to do so. I was howling like an animal.`
`We were like animals trying to kill each other, both getting covered in blood,`
` and, inevitably, as one convulsed in a pool of that blood, the other threw back its head and howled.`
`My body shivered with the joy I felt inside of me.`
` This was death,`
` the most final of judgments,`
` and it was right before me.`
`The demons howled,`
` screamed,`
` and roared.`
`The roars faded, and my voice started to change from the voice of a demon back to that of a human.`
`As a demon, I roared,`
` but as a human, I sneered.`
`Rika was covered in blood from her neck down.`
`Her blood was`
` pouring out,`
` making a little noise.`
`Rika was still staring into my eyes.`
`I stared back at her.`
`I wasn't sure they were still eyes, though...`
`They were no longer human eyes... but the eyes of the dead.`
`Rika,`
` no, Rika's corpse vomited blood from her mouth and nose`
` and smiled.`
`Then, she dropped the knife.`
`She stuck her hands out and turned her palms upward.`
`Her wiggling fingers reminded me of an insect's legs.`
`Those fingers reached for her own throat.`
`I'd never seen anything like it.`
`I'd never seen anybody do this before.`
`Because... Rika was scratching her own throat... she was ripping her own throat apart.`
`Maybe that wasn't a good description.`
`She was trying to rip out the inside of her throat through the opening she'd made with the knife.`
`Her fingers found the biggest tear.`
`Rika smiled.`
`At least that's what I would have called it if she were alive.`
`She ripped open the tear in one tug.`
`"Wha... whaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!"`
`Upon hearing my scream,`
` Rika died and fell on her face`
` into the pool of blood.`
`That was it.`
`She didn't get up again to show me her throat.`
`I stepped back from Rika Furude's body and bumped into the wall in the hallway.`
`Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!`
`I roared again in admiration of the ritual dance of dedication of the head of the Furude family.`
`Joy ran through my body, and my blood rushed through my veins.`
`"I won, I won!!!`
` I defeated her!!`
` Raaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`I then realized I'd disposed of the heads of the Three Families, the core of the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Everything was finally exposed.`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama and its masterminds were all exposed.`
`I disposed of the leaders of the Three Families, who all killed Satoshi-kun.`
`The head of the Sonozaki family died of a heart attack.`
`She was at the bottom of the well, along with a wheelchair.`
`I apprehended the head of the Kimiyoshi family.`
`He'd continue to tiptoe until he died.`
`The head of the Furude family died`
` in a way that was perfect for the final head of the Three Families of Onigafuchi.`
`I did it.`
` I accomplished my mission.`
`I defeated all the masterminds`
` who killed Satoshi-kun with the curse!`
` Every one!!`
`Satoshi-kun, you were powerless.`
` You didn't have the means to fight back.`
`Those evil people simply sneered while they let you die`
` after marking you as a member of the cursed Houjou family.`
`I will never, ever forgive them!!!`
`They believed you deserved to die because you were one of the Houjous.`
`As long as it was done by the curse of Oyashiro-sama, they didn't care how you were killed!!`
`I will never forgive those people for creating this world!!`
`What could I have done to save you, Satoshi-kun?`
`I couldn't save you.`
`Shion Sonozaki couldn't do anything else at the time!!`
`If I was Mion, not Shion!!`
`If I was Mion that day!!!`
`I could have saved you. Mion could have saved you!!`
`That's right, I remember now!!`
` Shion!!`
` She said she wanted to eat red snapper sashimi that day!!`
` I was supposed to eat that!!`
` But Shion pouted and cried...`
` That was why I let her switch, just for that night!!! `
`I did it to make her happy, like a big sister would!!!`
` Shion was never treated well, so I felt bad!`
` That was it!!!`
` I was being a good sister, that was it!!`
`When morning came...`
`The world had been turned upside down, and it had remained so until today.`
`We weren't twins anymore.`
`The one with the demon was Mion and the one without the demon was Shion.`
` What was that supposed to mean?`
`Wait, wait, Mom, listen!!`
` I'm Mion, not her!!!`
`You can tell us apart, right, Mom?`
` Look, can't you tell I'm Mion?`
` Come on, everyone, tell me I'm Mion!!`
` I'm Mion!!`
` Don't call me Shion!!`
` I'm Mion, I am!!!`
`"Then I realized.`
` You knew, didn't you?`
` That the relatives weren't gathering for a simple party that night. You knew!"`
`"No, I didn't!!`
` I really didn't know!!"`
`"Huh? How can you say that?`
` You were so persistent that day!!!`
` You said you'd never eaten red snapper before, so you really wanted to try it!!`
` You never gave up asking me!!!"`
`"I really didn't know!!`
` I didn't know... If I had known, I wouldn't have said that!!"`
`"Oh, sure!!`
` You were always jealous of me. Always looking at me with those foxy eyes!!`
` That was why I switched with you every once in a while!! `
`But you weren't satisfied with just that. You became even more jealous.`
` And that night, you knew what was going on, and took Mion from me. `
`You took Mion from me!!! `
`Give Mion back!! `
`I'm the one who's Mion. `
`I am Mion Sonozaki!! `
`You were Shion this whole time!! `
`Don't call yourself Mion, you impostor!!!"`
`I kicked the bars of the cell repeatedly while I roared!!`
`Compared to my roar, the metallic noise of the bars sounded like the cry of a little puppy.`
`I had been convinced by something so stupid.`
`The tattoo of the demon was just a way of telling us apart.`
`Even without that tattoo, I am Mion. That's right, I am Mion Sonozaki!!!`
`I gathered my hair and put it in a ponytail with the yellow band that Mion used all the time.`
`Since I didn't feel my hair on my neck,`
` I felt like I could think more clearly now.`
`Two Mions looked at each other through the iron bars.`
`According to our sibling rules, that was never to happen.`
`Yes, there was only one Mion and one Shion!`
`There could never be two of either at the same time!`
`"Shion, let your hair down!!`
` I am Mion, and Mion is here!`
` You were never Mion!!`
` So don't pretend to be me ever again, do you hear?`
` I said, do you hear? If you do, answer me! ANSWER ME, Shion!!!"`
`I took myself back on this day.`
` Shion admitted she was Shion.`
`"Haaahhh... how wonderful it is to be Mion!`
` I feel great.`
` I can think clearly now,`
` because after all, Mion is capable of anything,`
` unlike you, Shion.`
` How dare you pretend to be Mion!`
` Do you have any idea?! `
`Huh, Shion?!"`
`"...Yes, Sis..."`
`Shion called me "Sis."`
`And so, I was Mion!!!`
` Ahhhhhhhhh!!!`
`The demon who had been asleep deep inside of me was finally allowed to wake up.`
`The demon roared, and my whole body shivered to express its joy.`
`"Shion, you committed a great sin.`
` You were Mion until now.`
` You were in a powerful position as Mion of the Sonozaki family, yet you didn't even try to rescue Satoshi-kun! `
`You had millions of chances to save him, but you chose not to do anything.`
`I won't forgive you, I'll never forgive you. I could have saved Satoshi-kun!!`
` You took him from me and you killed him. I'll never forgive you for that!!!"`
`Shion was shaking on the other side of the bars.`
`"I will kill you. I'll kill you in the best possible way!!!`
` Starting today, I'm going to think of the best, most gruesome way to kill you!!`
` Shion, you better spend every minute`
` fearing`
` what's coming to you!!! `
`I won't just kill you. I'll make sure your death is long and miserable!!!`
` And after you're dead, I'll throw you into the well.`
` You better apologize to Satoshi-kun when you get there!!! `
`This is what you get for pretending to be me!!`
` Do you hear me?`
` That's your sin!!`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"`
`I needed to at least clean up the kitchen.`
` While I was putting old newspapers on the floor to absorb the blood, the phone rang.`
`I didn't want to answer, but maybe I should.`
`I should answer it and talk to whoever it was.`
`"Hello, this is the Sonozaki residence."`
`"Thank you for answering. This is Houjou calling."`
`I was surprised to hear the Houjou name,`
` but I realized right away that it was Satoko.`
`"Oh...`
` Satoko?`
` What's the matter?"`
`"Sorry to call so late...`
` Is Rika not there with you?"`
`Ah, yes.`
` Ever since Satoko Houjou was abandoned, she had been living with Rika Furude.`
`Of course she'd get suspicious that Rika hadn't returned yet.`
`"Ah, yeah, she's here."`
`"Oh, she's still there?`
` It's long past dinner time!"`
`..................`
`"......Hey, Satoko.`
` I......`
` I made too much dinner tonight`
` so I told Rika-chan to eat here with me..."`
`"Eh?`
` I-Is that so?`
` Ooh..."`
`"Why don't you come over too?`
` I have plenty of food left.`
` Rika-chan has already started eating."`
`"Oh, Rika!`
` A-Alright, I'll clean up a little and then head out.`
` See you shortly."`
`"Okay.`
` I'll be here.`
` See ya."`
`Click.`
