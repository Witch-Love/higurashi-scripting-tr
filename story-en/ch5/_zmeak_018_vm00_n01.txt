`I got drunk, fell asleep, and decided to stay overnight.`
` Was that because of the alcohol,`
` or did someone put a drug in my drink?`
`It's not like me to get drunk and spend a night at the hag's house.`
`I wanted to forget about what happened in that eerie storehouse, so I drank too much.`
`But it really was strange for me to get that drunk.`
`"Hey, Mion...`
` Now that I think about it...... I did have a reason to kill the hag.`
` Do you know what it was?`
` ...It wasn't just because she killed Satoshi-kun.`
` It's because she lied!!"`
`"I believe you don't know anything.`
` You aren't even sure if the hag actually trusted you.`
` But... I don't know if she forgave Satoshi-kun because of what I did.`
` She wouldn't have told you the truth."`
