`I fell comfortably asleep, and ended up staying overnight.`
` Was that just because I was tired,`
` or did someone put a drug in my food?`
`It's not like me to fall straight into a deep sleep and spend a night at grandma's house.`
`I wanted to forget about what happened in that eerie storehouse, so I got a little carried away.`
`But it feels like more than a coincidence.`
`"Hey, Mion...`
` Now that I think about it...... I did have a reason to kill grandma.`
` Do you know what it was?`
` ...It wasn't just because she killed Satoshi-kun.`
` It's because she lied!!"`
`"I believe you don't know anything.`
` You aren't even sure if the old lady actually trusted you.`
` But... I don't know if she forgave Satoshi-kun because of what I did.`
` She wouldn't have told you the truth."`
