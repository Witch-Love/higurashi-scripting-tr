`"All right, it's lunchtime!!`
` Hey, Rena, put our desks together!"`
`"Ahahahaha. My lunch has meat balls today!"`
`"Sounds good!`
` This ol' man will have some, then.`
` Rika-chan, bring your desk over."`
`"......I'm coming.`
` Whooshâ˜†."`
`"Ho ho ho!`
` Unfortunately, meat balls are my favorite too!`
` I won't allow you to have any!!"`
`"Unfortunately, I won't let you do that either, Satoko. `
`You have to have some veggies, so I cooked some squash for you."`
`"Whoa, that's harsh, Shion."`
`"Whaaah...... I hate squash!!`
` Whaah!"`
`"Don't be so picky about your food! `
`Squash is very nutritious.`
` You're still growing, so you need to think about things like that. `
`As long as I live, I won't let you have an unbalanced diet. `
`Here guys, have some. Steamed squash is delicious."`
`"......Munch, munch.`
` Satoko, it's really sweet."`
`"Yeah, it's super good!`
` The balance of flavors is perfect!`
` Satoko, don't eat this. It's too good for you!!"`
`"E-Excuse me?!!`
` I don't like your tone!!"`
`"Just try one!`
` Take a bite!"`
`"See?`
` Isn't it good?"`
`"......Hmm......`
` well, it isn't so bad..."`
`"Of course it isn't.`
` I've been working hard every day to get you to overcome your dislike of squash. `
`Okay, now that that's done with, why don't you overcome your fear of eggplants,`
` green peppers,`
` and asparagus within the year?"`
`"Stop joking!!!`
` At this rate, I'll transfer to a school in Okinomiya!!!"`
`"Come on!`
` I'm in charge of your health, since Satoshi-kun asked me to take care of you.`
` I won't let you eat junk food, either!"`
`"Whaaaah, I hate you, Shion-san!!`
` I hate squash!!!"`
