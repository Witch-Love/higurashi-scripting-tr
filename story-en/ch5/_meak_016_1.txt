`...I was too scared to sleep.`
`If I went to sleep, I might not find Satoshi-kun there in the morning.`
`So I kept talking to him until I passed out...`
`I told him about what happened while he was missing...`
`I told him that I realized how much I loved him after he went away.`
`I'd searched for him, looking into various different things.`
`I'd gathered underground information through Kasai, and bargained for police information with Ooishi.`
`But I couldn't find any leads. A long time passed, but I kept thinking about him.`
`Et cetera, et cetera...`
` I told him all the small details from my daily life.`
`...The places I wanted to go with him,`
` the things I wanted to do with him,`
` the food I wanted to share with him...`
` and, and......`
` I told him a lot of things.`
`I was sitting up at first.`
`But I got tired, so I lay down.`
`...I got tired of moving my mouth too, so I started talking to him in my mind......`
` It was the happiest night I'd ever had.`
`When I woke up...`
`.........I didn't find Satoshi-kun by my side.`
`I knew it somehow...`
` I was afraid of it.`
` That was why I didn't want to go to sleep.`
`...But at least I got to see him for one night.`
`...Just when I'd resigned myself to that...`
`...I felt Satoshi-kun's presence again... It wasn't a dream after all. I thanked God.`
`And so I began my strange life with Satoshi-kun.`
`As promised, Satoshi-kun was always by my side.`
`...He couldn't laugh, mumble, or stroke my head.`
`...But he was always with me,`
` always right by my side.`
`He disappeared sometimes, but he'd come back when I looked for him.`
`It seemed that all I could hear was his footsteps.`
`...That's just the way it was.`
`...It was a bit sad, but I was still satisfied.`
`His presence was really faint, so it was hard to sense him in a crowd.`
`But he never left me.`
`...If he were tangible, I'd be taking his hand all the time so that he wouldn't be lost.`
`In contrast, I could feel him very strongly in a quiet environment.`
`Of course,`
` I couldn't tell what his expressions were, because he was just a presence.`
`...But... after I got used to it, I could tell what he was thinking.`
`At first, I could only tell if he was laughing or not.`
`...Eventually, I started to feel his emotions more strongly.`
`...I could communicate with him normally.`
`...I was usually alone with him, though.`
`I didn't want to go to school or hang out with my friends anymore.`
`But... Satoshi-kun got upset about that.`
`He'd keep mumbling unhappily.`
`Now that I knew he'd always be with me,`
` I shouldn't just stay home all the time.`
`I was sticking to my time alone with him, however, because I was scared that he might suddenly disappear again, and I wanted to make the most of the time I was sharing with him right now.`
`I must've been worrying too excessively.`
`...Satoshi-kun will always be by my side.`
`Yeah.`
`...That was his promise.`
`...He never breaks his promises.`
`I was fine, because he was there.`
`Of course, I couldn't tell anybody about him, not even Sis.`
`I could try to explain it to them, but they'd never understand.`
`But I was certain.`
`Certain that he was with me.`
`So...`
` I'd be all right...`
`"Shion-san, what are you going to do`
` on Watanagashi this year?"`
`"Hm.`
` I guess I'll have some fun at the festival.`
` Maybe I'll tease Sis and her friends...`
` Ahahahaha."`
`I wanted to go to the festival with Satoshi-kun.`
`I knew he liked to see me having fun with everybody.`
`He might get jealous if I play with Kei-chan...`
`But Satoshi-kun isn't very sensitive in that way.`
`Satoshi-kun loved to see me and my friends have fun...`
` so, I should have a lot of fun for his sake.`
`Then I'd talk about the day with him later.`
`"How are you going to Hinamizawa?`
` I can give you a ride if you want."`
`"I'm taking my moped, so you don't have to."`
`"That won't do.`
` Aren't you going to the family party afterwards?`
` I can't let you drive under the influence."`
`He won't let me drive,`
` but he's kind enough to let me drink.`
`"All right, take me then."`
`"Good.`
` Let's leave before nightfall.`
` I'll come pick you up around that time."`
`After Kasai left... I sensed that Satoshi-kun was excited about going to the festival.`
`".........Watanagashi, huh...?`
` So... it's been almost a year since you went away..."`
`Satoshi-kun seemed confused.`
`"I bet you're going all 'mmph...' right now, aren't you?`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`We laughed together...`
