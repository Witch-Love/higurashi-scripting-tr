`At first I thought Ooishi's theory that the Sonozaki family banished Satoshi-kun from Hinamizawa and looked after Satoko in return...`
` was bogus.`
`But thinking about it now, it doesn't seem too far-fetched.`
`After all, Satoko Houjou started living with Rika Furude after Satoshi-kun's disappearance.`
`Rika Furude isn't just a regular girl.`
`She was the head of the Furude family, one of the Three Families.`
`The head of the Kimiyoshi family is Rika Furude's guardian.`
`The Sonozaki family probably couldn't step in, due to having been officially opposed to the Houjou family,`
` but Satoko Houjou is in the custody of the Three Families now.`
`Even though the Houjou family was severely ostracized during the dam conflict, Satoko Houjou was now under protection.`
`It seems as though only Satoko was exempted from blame.`
`Why was she spared, even though Satoshi-kun wasn't?`
