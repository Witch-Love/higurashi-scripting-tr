`I exchanged information with Ooishi every now and then.`
`We'd each expect new leads from each other, but neither of us had any luck.`
`I no longer believe the tip that Satoshi-kun might've headed to Tokyo.`
`It was clearly bogus, anyway.`
`Although I can't befriend Ooishi, he's been fair about the deal.`
` He alone has been serious about uncovering any new information.`
`Ooishi's sources are quite reliable, so whenever I found some dubious tip, I'd check with him to see if it was valid.`
`My meetings with him have diminished in frequency, since he's been assigned to new cases.`
`......Eventually, we stopped meeting entirely.`
`Ooishi stopped investigating, and I reached the limits of my sources of information.`
`...People now think that Satoshi-kun's disappearance was`
` a supernatural phenomenon called 'demoning away.'`
`In Hinamizawa, they refer to his disappearance as him having 'transferred,' and nobody will talk about it otherwise.`
`...I don't like the way that phrase...`
` is used to erase him.`
