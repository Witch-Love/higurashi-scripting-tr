`"I thought you were marked by grandma.`
` Is it okay for you to be here?"`
`"It seems that Teppei Houjou fled the premises.`
` He seems to be staying with an intimate ladyfriend in Okinomiya."`
`"Teppei?`
` Who's that?`
` ......Oh, Satoshi-kun's uncle, huh?"`
`"Their aunt - Tamae Houjou, Satoshi, and Satoko are the only ones living in the house now.`
` Ever since Tamae learned that Teppei had fled to another woman, she's been in a foul mood."`
`"So that must mean...`
` that the aunt is being even nastier to Satoko, and Satoshi-kun is taking even more indirect blows." `
`"I don't know about Satoshi-kun, but I heard that Satoko-san is in a bad state. The neighbors are spreading rumors about her."`
`"Does grandma make the decision?`
` If so, Sis should know about it by now.`
` Kasai,`
` do you know anything?"`
`"...She's been hurt so much it's clear to see, she's so torn up...`
` And everybody abandoned her...`
` Everybody did."`
