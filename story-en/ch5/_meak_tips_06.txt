`Somebody whispered to me from behind.`
`They told me that I was going to be the victim of the curse this year.`
`So I'm going to disappear soon.`
`There'll be nobody left to take care of Satoko.`
`Somebody whispered to me from behind.`
`They told me that I don't have much time.`
`That I won't stay as myself for much longer.`
`So I had to make the best of the days I had left.`
`What could I leave for Satoko?`
`She wanted that huge teddy bear.`
`She wanted a peaceful life in which nobody would bully her.`
`I whispered to the person at my back.`
`Bestow your violent nature and formidable strength upon me.`
`I want your peaceful mind`
` filled with hatred.`
