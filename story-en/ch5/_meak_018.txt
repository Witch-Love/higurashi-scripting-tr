`Mion's words were stuck in my head.`
`If those two dead bodies were the result of the curse...`
`Then there should be two sacrifices to calm Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`The four of us snuck into the shrine storage together.`
` It was a simple equation.`
`Did that mean that Keiichi and I were in danger?`
`Maybe`
` it was a good thing I woke up in the middle of the night.`
`I could have been the one to wake up in a cell.`
`Sometimes it's hard to recognize danger when you avoid it accidentally.`
`A part of me wanted to just laugh at the idea but another part felt frightened that I was so close to being in Mion's position.`
`If my thinking was correct,`
` I wonder how Keiichi Maebara was doing right now.`
`I didn't see him in any of the cells.`
`But that didn't guarantee his safety.`
`Takano-san and Tomitake-san had been executed.`
`There was a possibility that Keiichi could already be dead.`
`But just like what happened to Satoshi-kun, it might only happen after a few days.`
`When the sun rose,`
` I was going to pretend to be Mion and head to her school.`
`I was going to check if Keiichi Maebara was safe.`
`If he had already disappeared, the enemy would come after me next.`
`I'd have to be a decoy for myself.`
`But if he was still safe...`
`I'd need to keep my eyes on him.`
`I was sure the enemy would come after that scatterbrain.`
`If I became Mion, Shion would disappear.`
`The enemy would think Shion had already been demoned away, and they'd concentrate on Keiichi.`
`If nothing happened to Keiichi...`
`That would also be fine.`
`It'd prove that nothing would happen to me either.`
`The hag was still sleeping in the wheelchair.`
`I was going to interrogate her...`
` but actually, I wasn't expecting to learn that much.`
`The woman who was also known as Empress Sonozaki...`
`Probably wouldn't say a thing even if her fingers were cut off.`
`Mion, her successor, was the complete opposite. She spoke readily but didn't know too much about anything.`
`Mion had said she was only a messenger`
` and that someone else was taking care of problems on the underside...`
`It was possible Mion had grown to be a good liar, and that she tried to deceive me with a straight face.`
`But at the same time, I could see the hag not letting Mion get involved in the underside of the village.`
`If I were her...`
`I wouldn't have used Mion for that either.`
`Unlike me, Mion was a nice person.`
`While there were only ones and zeroes in the world, she believed there were numbers with decimal points.`
`In other words, she could never be cruel.`
`If the hag thought the same way as I do...`
`It was very possible.`
`The one who took care of problems on the underside, X, was the one who actually governed the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`If the hag became concerned about something, X would deal with it, either directly or indirectly.`
`Or maybe the hag and X would discuss the details first.`
`But... did X really exist?`
`If he did, his place in the village hierarchy was a lot more important than that of the successor.`
`Unlike Mion, who was too nice,`
` he was discreet,`
` cruel`
` and cunning.`
` Furthermore, he was extremely close to the hag.`
`Someone who would have a lot of contact with her just before it was time for the curse...`
`Because of the way Tomitake-san died, it could be someone who regularly dealt with unusual drugs. He could be a member of a medical institution.`
`The director of the Irie Clinic...`
` Irie?`
`In this isolated village, Irie was famous for opening such a beautiful clinic, and for working so hard for the villagers' sake.`
`The villagers liked his mature personality, and really respected him.`
`There's nothing scarier than a doctor who's also a murderer.`
`If Irie was the person behind the curse, all the mysterious deaths could be explained.`
`However, there was only a slim chance of Irie being X.`
`The main reason being that the hag wouldn't trust him.`
`Like many of the elderly, the hag doesn't like young people. I knew she'd never trust him, because of his age.`
`Furthermore, she had openly criticized his behavior among the relatives once.`
`Although Irie was famous, he was an outsider, after all.`
`He wasn't born here.`
`He tried to maintain a good relationship with the villagers as the director of the clinic, but that was just on the surface.`
`I couldn't even imagine the hag telling him about her worries, or about the village's underside.`
`If she was as suspicious of others as I was...`
`Then she'd only gather trustworthy people to deal with that underside.`
`The first people that came to my mind were the leaders of the Three Families.`
`Leaving Rika-chama out, the head of the Kimiyoshi family was a strong possibility.`
`He was the only one who could advise Empress Sonozaki.`
`They were of a similar age, and everyone knew that they were very close outside the family councils.`
`Furthermore, as the mayor, he often went to the Sonozaki house just before Watanagashi to discuss festival preparations.`
`I could easily picture them talking privately.`
`The one who executed the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The one who murdered Takano-san and Tomitake-san.`
`The mastermind behind the series of the mysterious deaths that had been going for the past five years.`
`Was he coming after me?`
`Did he get to Satoshi-kun?`
`When I thought about Satoshi-kun...`
`I felt elevated.`
`I was fearful of possibly being this year's victim until just a moment ago.`
`I was scared that X was after me.`
`But when I thought about it, I realized.`
`Whoever it was, this person had gotten Satoshi-kun.`
`I'd looked so hard, but I couldn't find him.`
` I'd almost forgotten about this enemy.`
`For better or for worse, he was going to appear before me again.`
`No matter how hard I'd tried, I couldn't find that enemy,`
` but now, he was trying to find me.`
`That was it.`
` I wasn't only being chased.`
` I was chasing too.`
`When I realized all this...`
`I was no longer afraid of dying to the fifth year's curse... It had become a game.`
`I wasn't only being threatened.`
`I was threatening too.`
`Now was the time to settle the score for Satoshi-kun.`
`Now was the time to awaken passions that had grown weak over the past year.`
`I could feel righteous indignation and courage flare up within me.`
`The only emotion that can defeat fear is anger.`
`When my anger completely overtook my fear...`
`I felt as if I were reborn.`
`"Why don't you wake up, Empress of Hags?"`
`I kicked her wheelchair rather violently.`
`But that didn't wake her up either.`
`"Are you just pretending to be asleep?"`
`I grabbed her hair and pulled her head up.`
`But even then, the hag still stayed silent with a straight face.`
`Then I noticed something.`
`I looked for an appropriate torture device.`
`They were all large-scale, none of them being particularly handy.`
`That's when I saw a cigarette lighter on a cushion in the tatami room.`
`One of the relatives must have left it there.`
`I lit the lighter.`
`A huge flame appeared.`
`I turned the lighter off and went back to the hag with it.`
`"Can you see it?`
` Can't you see it?`
` This is a cigarette lighter somebody left behind."`
`I lit it in front of her eyes.`
`"I'm going to burn your nose now.`
` You don't want that, do you?`
` I wouldn't want it.`
` So why don't you quit pretending to be asleep?"`
`...There was still no response.`
`I put the flame right under her nose without hesitation.`
`...The tip of the flame touched the tip of her nose.`
`The flame must have burned her nose hair. It smelled terrible.`
`I was already certain...`
` but I continued anyway.`
`I brought the flame closer to her eye.`
`...Her eyelid didn't move one bit.`
`The flame burned her eyelashes, making it smell awful again.`
`I turned the lighter off and then felt her throat and wrist.`
`......I didn't feel any warmth.`
`I didn't feel a pulse either.`
`"Did she......`
` ......die from the stun gun?"`
`There was no way she could pretend to be asleep while being burned.`
`Even if she could endure the pain...`
`Anyone would reflexively move their eyelids if a flame came close to their eyes.`
` But she didn't.`
`I turned the sink water on and aimed the end of a hose at the hag's face.`
`The water pressure wasn't too high, but by squeezing the tip of the hose, I could make it squirt out.`
`The water hit the hag in the face, but there was still no reaction.`
`Shit...`
` You've got to be kidding me...`
`She's dead...`
`The one who was at the center of everything... is dead now...!`
`I knew she wouldn't talk.`
`But I didn't expect her to end up dead.`
`I'd never even thought of killing her.`
`I walked around the room restlessly.`
`I didn't feel guilty, but instead felt frustrated with what I'd done.`
`Come on,`
` I need to calm down.`
`What do I need to be afraid of?`
`Calm down`
` and stay cool.`
` Calm down.`
` Stay cool.`
`I could feel my brain starting to calm down,`
`and my emotions cooling down with it.`
`She was my true enemy.`
`It was just that I killed her before confronting her about it.`
`Sooner or later, I would have killed her anyway.`
`She wouldn't have said anything in the first place, so there wasn't really a reason why I should've let her live.`
`I didn't realize that until now, and that was why I got frustrated.`
`"............"`
`My revenge for Satoshi-kun started`
` with the unexpected death of my grandmother.`
`It was such a strange feeling, like I was wearing sopping wet clothes.`
`I replaced that feeling with anger.`
`I couldn't forgive her.`
`I couldn't forgive the hag for abusing the Houjou family, including Satoshi-kun, for so many years. She cornered him psychologically as well as physically.`
`She didn't deserve an easy death from a stun gun.`
`I picked up a whip that was hanging on the wall.`
`The whip was designed to make sure the person on the receiving end got seriously injured.`
`I swung it up... and then down.`
`The sound reminded me of when I was a child hitting things with a jump rope I pretended was a whip.`
`But unlike then, I'd made a purple mark on the hag's face, and reddish-black blood started oozing out.`
`I swung it up and then down again.`
`This time, the whip hits her in the head. Her hair flew in the air.`
`I saw a bunch of her hair on the tip of the whip.`
`At the end of the bunch of hair, there was a piece of her skin.`
`Seemed the whip had ripped part of her scalp off.`
`I continued to hit her with the whip. I didn't bother removing the hair beforehand.`
`The tip of the whip was divided into many points, with each point having a fish hook on the end.`
`Those hooks, added to the speed of the whip, not only scratched the victim, but tore their skin as well.`
`The hag's hair was all messed up and her face was getting bloody.`
`She'd started to look like a real demon.`
`I stopped the whipping.`
` Not because my arm was tired but because I couldn't stand the feeling of her hair on the tip touching me every time I swung the whip.`
`I threw the whip at the hag.`
`Breathing heavily, I realized I was covered in her hair.`
`It almost felt like thousands of maggots crawling all over me.`
`I brushed it off violently.`
`"Hah, hah... hah...`
` ......You deserve this,`
` you fucking demon-hag..."`
`I put my hands on my knees and exhaled roughly.`
`It was then that I noticed it.`
` ...I perked up and turned around.`
`............`
`There it is.`
`The person who had been watching me`
` since I snuck into the shrine storage.`
`I sensed this person sitting in the tatami room. It enjoyed watching me torture my grandmother.`
`An overwhelming emotion started to swallow me up.`
`I tried desperately not to feel it.`
`"How long have you been there?`
` ...You should have said something."`
`It was just there.`
`Just like Satoshi-kun, it was just there.`
`It was extremely uncomfortable to have it just be there...`
`"I see... Rena told me.`
` Are you...`
` Oyashiro-sama?"`
`I smiled boldly.`
`...And yet, I could feel my body shivering.`
`"You can't fool me.`
` Are you saying that you're Oyashiro-sama, and that the curse of Oyashiro-sama really does exist?`
` ...Come on!!!`
` Who would believe something like that?!`
` Huh?!"`
`It was just my imagination. It couldn't be the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The curse couldn't be real.`
`Everything was done by humans. They made everything look like it was a curse!`
`"Well, I don't care if you saw what I did.`
` I won't charge you for it.`
` But if you're thinking about interfering, I won't hold back, you know?!!"`
`No matter what I said, nothing happened.`
`It was like trying to communicate with an insect.`
`I felt like I was staring at a spider in the middle of its web, and the spider was staring back.`
`"......Hmm..."`
`I turned to the hag in the wheelchair.`
`...I couldn't leave her body here forever.`
`...If I don't need to make her death known, then it should be quick, and it's best if a body doesn't exist.`
`Not even in this secret, underground torture room.`
`Whew...`
`I exhaled to try to calm myself down.`
`Oh,`
` I remember now.`
`When I was a little girl...`
`Kasai used to love making me feel scared. He often told me scary stories about various horrible things.`
`I recalled his story about the secret torture room of the Sonozaki family.`
`......According to`
` the story...`
`There was a well in the torture room for dumping bodies in.`
`There was a pile of tortured corpses at the bottom of the well, and resentful moans could be heard echoing from there.`
`And about halfway down the well, there was a different tunnel, which was a secret passage leading into the distant mountains.`
`That bit was from Mion's telling of the story.`
`It was probably an amalgamation of tellings from different relatives.`
`......The room was supposed to be a huge secret, but everyone got loose lips at the chance to have fun scaring the young successor.`
`"Mion...`
` do you remember one of our relatives talking about a hidden well a long time ago? `
`There's supposed to be a hidden well somewhere in this underground torture room, and it's connected to a secret passage..."`
`"..............."`
`"Did you hear some noise earlier?`
` That was me whipping the hag."`
`"............"`
`Mion didn't reply, but I saw her bite her lip.`
`"Don't worry,`
` I won't whip you.`
` But if you don't cooperate, I might punish her some more.`
` Next time I won't use a whip."`
`"Down at the end...`
` do you see a cell in the darkness?`
` It's in there."`
`Mion pointed weakly.`
` I walked down to where her finger indicated.`
`A light bulb lit up the cell. It was a lot smaller than the one Mion was in.`
`It was very shallow, and I didn't even need to open the door to see how tiny it was.`
`Of course there's no well in there.`
`I became angry, assuming that she lied to me. But after considering it, I didn't actually think she would at this point.`
`I opened the door and walked in.`
`I noticed something immediately.`
`There was an opening right in the middle of the cell.`
`This opening was naturally disguised.`
`The way the rocks and the shadows were positioned perfectly hid the well.`
`The tip of a rock inside of the cell concealed the entrance. Unless you went in, you'd never notice.`
`But it was such a shallow cell that nobody would even think of going in.`
`Besides, the bars allow you to see the inside well enough.`
`The cell is not even a few meters deep, so it would only take a glance to see everything.`
`Nobody would think of unlocking the door and walking in.`
`But walking in was the only way anyone could find the well.`
`Furthermore, there were many cells in this huge cave.`
`Who'd think that one of them was hiding a secret well?`
`The inside of the well was dark. I couldn't see anything.`
`But every little noise I made produced echoes. I could tell this was a very deep well.`
`I brought a flashlight from the torture room and shone it down the well.`
`It almost looked more like a vertical tunnel.`
`Obviously a man-made one, at that.`
`There were wedges on the wall, like a ladder, and they looked as if they were inviting me to descend.`
`It's kind of ironic that the secret escape route from an underground torture room ended up being a well that takes you even further down.`
`You had no way of knowing whether it would take you to freedom or to Hell.`
`Furthermore, there were the tortured bodies of past victims at the bottom.`
`Who would be able to go down this well without hesitation?`
`Nobody in their right mind could go down this well to look for a secret tunnel, hearing the voices of the dead all the while.`
`"Have you ever gone down that well, Mion?"`
`"I've never even wanted to..."`
`"Ahaha, I feel the same way.`
` Why would I go down the well where they tossed the victims of this torture room?"`
`I went back to the torture room and then returned to the cave, pushing the wheelchair containing the hag.`
`Mion screamed.`
`"Sh-Shion...`
` are you going to push Granny down the well?!"`
`"No, I'm not. I'm just dumping her body.`
` She's dead."`
`"............!!"`
`"Rest assured, I didn't torture her to death.`
` It was probably the stun gun.`
` Maybe her heart failed.`
` I could just leave her body here, but I don't want it to rot, you know?"`
`"How could you...?"`
`"Hey, do you want to take care of her even now that she's dead?`
` Maybe you can use chopsticks to pick maggots off her body.`
` Huh?!"`
`Mion covered her ears and shook her head.`
`Everything I said seemed to bother Mion. Her own life wasn't guaranteed at this point.`
`"...Shion... why... did you do this?"`
`"Let's see...`
` Why do you think?"`
`Nobody said anything for a while, but the silence was soon broken.`
`".........Satoshi...?"`
`"..............."`
`"Is this...... revenge...?"`
`"I don't know if it was really revenge`
` since it happened so quickly. I'm sure she died without even feeling a thing."`
`"........................"`
`I slapped the hag's head.`
`"You said it too.`
` You told me that if I ripped out my nails, she would forgive everyone!!`
` That's why I ripped out three of my nails!!!`
` I did what you told me to, right?`
` But she didn't keep her promise. `
`She made Satoshi-kun disappear!!`
` Why?!`
` What was that for!?!?"`
`I continued to slap the hag's head.`
`Her blood was all over my hand by then, and it felt gross.`
`I tried to wipe it off on her clothes, but then her hair got on my hand.`
`I ran to the sink in the torture room and washed my hands with a brush.`
`When I was done, I went back to Mion's cell.`
`"After Satoshi-kun disappeared,`
` you came over and told me.`
` You said the relationship between me and Satoshi-kun was forgiven.`
`You also said`
` that the Sonozaki main house had nothing to do with Satoshi-kun's disappearance."`
`"...Yeah... I..."`
`"YOU LIED!!!!"`
`Lied!!`
` Lied!!`
` Lied!!`
` Lied!`
` Lied!`
` Lied...`
` Lied...`
` Lied...`
`My shouts echoed throughout the cave.`
`I was breathing heavily.`
`I felt like I used up all of the air in my lungs.`
`The hag didn't keep her promise.`
`She said she'd forgive everyone, but she lied.`
` She didn't forgive...`
` She didn't forgive Satoshi-kun!!`
`"Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar!`
` Damn it!`
` Damn it!!`
` Give me back Satoshi-kun!!!`
` I want him back!!`
` I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him!!"`
`I kicked the hag's leg repeatedly.`
`Each time I kicked, the wheelchair made a squeaky noise.`
`Hah, hah, hah, hah...`
` I ran out of breath and kneeled down.`
`Mion was still covering her ears, and was now shaking. There were tears in her eyes.`
`"Sorry to scare you.`
` Sorry about that.`
` ...If you really don't know, I won't torment you.`
` Don't worry.`
` But... if... you were ever lying to me...`
` Well, you'll have to accept whatever comes your way. `
`...You know what I mean?`
` Hee hee hee hee...`
` Ahahahaha...`
` A`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` hahaha ha ha ha!!!"`
