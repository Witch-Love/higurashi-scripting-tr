`Why don't I relate my encounter with that creepy girl in the rain?`
`Her name is Rena Ryuugu.`
`Her real first name is Reina.`
`I have no idea what kind of girl she really is.`
`One thing is certain. She has no relation to the Sonozaki family.`
`She has no relation to the Three Families as a whole, either.`
`The Ryuugu family used to live in Hinamizawa,`
`but then they moved to Ibaraki.`
`That was before she went to elementary school.`
` ...They returned to Hinamizawa some years later.`
`Rena Ryuugu said she came back because Oyashiro-sama told her to.`
`I don't know what that means.`
`She said it was the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`That Oyashiro-sama had stalked her.`
`I think that was probably a hallucination, but Satoshi-kun had been interested in that experience.`
`She said that Satoshi-kun was also experiencing Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`Satoshi-kun told her that he was being followed by some unknown existence.`
`He was surprised to learn that Rena had the same experience before.`
`What is Oyashiro-sama's curse...?`
`Why did Rena and Satoshi-kun have a similar experience?`
`I believe that means that somebody put them under surveillance.`
`Somebody must be spying on the next victim of the curse.`
`......Since Rena and Satoshi-kun both blindly believed in Oyashiro-sama's curse, they interpreted it as Oyashiro-sama's presence.`
`If paranoia kicked in, they'd feel as if they were experiencing paranormal phenomena.`
`Judging from what Rena said, it seems that Satoshi-kun had been put on surveillance since long before Watanagashi.`
`So,`
` one question comes to mind.`
`Why were they watching Rena?`
`I'm assuming that this surveillance was placed on a victim-to-be of that year.`
`If so, I don't understand why Rena went through it.`
`Why did they watch her, even though she was living so far away?`
`If she was considered somebody who abandoned the village, I could understand.`
`But she didn't fall victim in the end.`
`Maybe she was forgiven because she came back to Hinamizawa.`
`...I guess she still knows something I don't...`
