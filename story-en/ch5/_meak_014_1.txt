`"Eh?`
` What did you just say?"`
`"This is information from a reliable source. It appears that they found the murderer of Satoshi-kun's aunt."`
`It had been a few weeks since the murder.`
`Satoshi-kun still hadn't been found.`
`...I had no new information on his whereabouts.`
`Kasai's report came, as a result, completely out of the blue.`
`"Does that mean the police arrested the culprit?"`
`"It seems that he confessed during his interrogation regarding another case."`
`...That sounded strange.`
`If it was Satoshi-kun they arrested, he wouldn't have worded it that way.`
`It sounded as though Satoshi-kun wasn't the culprit.`
`"...Kasai,`
` who's the culprit...?"`
`So it wasn't Satoshi-kun...?`
` I swallowed those final words.`
`I was convinced that it was Satoshi-kun.`
` The police and Ooishi must've thought the same way.`
`The reason Ooishi approached me is because he was convinced that Satoshi-kun did it.`
`"Don't worry.`
` It doesn't seem like it's Satoshi-kun.`
` I heard it was a lunatic who was aiming to continue the series of mysterious deaths."`
`"What??`
` ...A lunatic?`
` What do you mean?"`
`Kasai shrugged.`
`"I don't know...`
` Since the investigation is classified as a confidential case,`
` the information I can get is limited."`
`"Confidential?`
` Why?"`
`"To prevent the village from developing a bad reputation.`
` You don't see articles about kidnapping while the police are negotiating with the culprit, do you?`
` It's something similar to that."`
`Come to think of it... I hadn't seen anything about the aunt's murder on TV or in the newspaper.`
`"These strange deaths have happened four years in a row now, on the day of Watanagashi.`
` There are those who try to make light of it, `
`and now this lunatic who confessed the aunt's murder said he did it in imitation of the series of mysterious deaths."`
`"........................"`
`Kasai didn't know anything else, so instead of probing him further, I reviewed the information myself.`
`...I was really shocked to learn all this.`
`I was convinced that Satoshi-kun killed her.`
`...I thought that was the reason he had to disappear.`
`But... it was actually some lunatic who killed her, and he had no relation to the aunt whatsoever.`
`So... Satoshi-kun had nothing to do with the murder?`
`If so...`
`Why did he disappear...?`
`I couldn't accept that this lunatic had killed the aunt.`
`And what's really strange is the phrase Kasai used, "four years in a row now."`
`After all, I'd been thinking that this murder happened because Satoshi-kun had been in a dire situation,`
` and had nothing to do with the series of mysterious deaths.`
`I felt as though Satoshi-kun's case had become somebody else's.`
`The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa is also known as the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Satoshi-kun's case had become one of those mysterious deaths.`
`...In other words, Satoshi-kun's case has become a part of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`I didn't like the way that sounded...`
`Because it was as though the curse had swallowed Satoshi-kun.`
`"Unfortunately,`
` we haven't been able to confirm the tip that Satoshi-kun took a train to Tokyo.`
` We don't even know whether or not he's in this prefecture, to be honest."`
`Ooishi broke the seal on a new can of instant coffee.`
`"I thought you knew his whereabouts already, since you seemed very convinced he was the culprit."`
`"Na ha ha ha ha.`
` You got me."`
`Ooishi chuckled and poured a cup of coffee which looked far too hot.`
`"...You have some good sources."`
`"Huh?"`
`"It's a highly classified case, but you already have this information.`
` I wonder who leaked it.`
` Looks like we need to review our security precautions."`
`Ooishi smirked.`
`Seemed he knew why I was here today.`
`"I'm one of the Sonozakis, after all.`
` And my ears are open."`
`I smirked back at him...`
` It's all about bluffing.`
`"Anyway.`
` Since we're friends now,`
` why don't we have a chat?`
` Nfufu."`
`"Let me ask you first.`
` Who's this real culprit?`
` I heard he was a lunatic, but what does that mean?"`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` I don't know how to answer that question.`
` I want to know the answer myself...`
` Really, I was convinced Satoshi-kun was the real culprit.`
` It was rather surprising for me, too."`
`Ooishi threw himself on the sofa and crossed his hands behind his head. He looked up at the ceiling and smiled wryly.`
`"...I suddenly received a call from the prefectural police the other day.`
` They said that one of the guys in detention confessed to the murder of the housewife."`
`"Who is it?"`
`"He's a crazy dopehead.`
` He's been in and out of prison for drug abuse.`
` His statement says that he was interested in the series of mysterious deaths and wanted to imitate them."`
`"...Are you sure he's the real culprit?"`
`"I didn't interrogate him myself,`
` but... the prefectural police tells me that he has information that only the real culprit would know.`
` He seems to have thrown the murder weapon into the Ouji River. `
`They're searching for it right now.`
` If it's found, his statement will be solid."`
`"...Even if the weapon wasn't found, would the case be closed?"`
`"Probably.`
` His statement clearly outlines the state of the crime scene and the body.`
` This information, like I said, covers details that only the actual murderer would know."`
`"......You don't seem quite convinced."`
`"....................."`
`Ooishi, still looking up at the ceiling, went quiet.`
`"As a matter of fact,`
` the dopehead was already dead`
` by the time I got their call."`
`"Dead?"`
`"...You know those spoons that are forked at the tip?`
` They use those at the detention facility.`
` I was told that he swallowed one and choked on it... `
`They couldn't tell if it was a suicide or if it was caused by some mental disorder."`
`I imagined somebody swallowing that spoon... and gagged.`
`"So, the investigation hadn't been done that thoroughly...`
` But although I'm not convinced, my superiors are.`
` I think with that, the case will be closed."`
`Ooishi turned his eyes from the ceiling to me.`
`He looked serious.`
`"...This is just what I personally feel, okay?`
` So please keep it between the two of us.`
` ...I believe that this lunatic is some kind of mistake."`
`"..............."`
`"It might be either a big misunderstanding caused by a chain of coincidences, or...`
` ...you know?`
`Na ha ha ha ha."`
`"I have no idea what you're talking about."`
`"I still believe that the real culprit is Satoshi Houjou-kun."`
`"......You sound confident."`
`"Unfortunately, we couldn't find anything to prove he was at the crime scene.`
` We obtained a warrant to search his house after he disappeared,`
` but we still found nothing."`
`"......But you still believe he did it?"`
`"Yes."`
`"...I wonder how you can be so sure even though you don't have any evidence.`
` It's incredible.`
` Is that supposed to be like the hunch of an experienced detective?"`
`"Yep.`
` It's the hunch of a guy who's been in this business for several decades."`
`Ooishi smiled in satisfaction, but I didn't feel relieved.`
`"......Where did Satoshi-kun go...?"`
`"His disappearance convinced me that he was the culprit.`
` If he wasn't the culprit... there'd be no real reason for him to disappear."`
`"...What if the murder actually was done by that lunatic and Satoshi-kun's disappearance has nothing to do with it...? `
`In other words, what if Satoshi-kun disappeared because the Sonozaki family didn't like my relationship with him,`
` and he has nothing to do with the murder...?"`
`Was Satoshi-kun a culprit`
` or a victim?`
`...The reason for his disappearance had become unclear...`
`"Hmmmmmm.........`
` I don't think they'd bother to make one person disappear just because of an undesirable relationship.`
`...What do you hear from inside the Sonozaki family?`
` Do you know anything?"`
`"I wouldn't be here if I did."`
`"Na ha ha ha. You're right."`
`Ooishi laughed out loud while scratching his head...`
` and after he stopped laughing, he leaned over.`
`"All right, how about this?`
` Why don't we make a deal?`
` A gentlemen's deal."`
`"A deal?`
` On what?"`
`"On information about Satoshi-kun's disappearance...`
` If you find any information like that, you tell me,`
` and I'll also provide you with information if I find any.`
` ...Do we have a deal?"`
`"That sounds too convenient for you."`
`Ooishi chuckled.`
`"...Shion-san...`
` I think if we leave things as they are, they'll conclude that the lunatic committed the murder.`
` If that happens, Satoshi-kun's disappearance will be treated as just another runaway minor. `
`They won't search for him as actively as before."`
`"....................."`
`"But I will continue searching for him.`
` Only I will do it.`
`...I believe you're intending to do the same."`
`"Our motives are different, though.`
` I just want to know if he's safe, but you'd like to arrest him, wouldn't you?"`
`"Nfu fu fu...`
` If the murder case was considered solved, Satoshi-kun would be free.`
` Regardless of his innocence."`
`"...I doubt that."`
`"Na ha ha ha ha..."`
`Ooishi chuckled again,`
` but his smile didn't reach his eyes.`
`"......Well, let's be friends from now on.`
` The enemy of your enemy is your friend, no?"`
`"I'm not opposed to the Sonozaki family, though."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I apologize then.`
` Nfu fu..."`
`This is the way of Kuraudo Ooishi, huh...?`
`...As Sis and Kasai said, I wouldn't want him as my enemy or my ally, because both would be too risky.`
`I probably shouldn't let my guard down in front of this big fat weasel......`
`I sipped on the coffee to fill up the silence, though I wasn't thirsty.`
`...Outside the window, I could see normal life taking its course.`
`But...... Satoshi-kun wasn't there.`
`He should have been there, but he wasn't.`
`...I was scared that I might grow used to his absence someday.`
`...Where was he...?`
`".........I wonder how Satoshi-kun is doing..."`
`".........I hope he's all right."`
`"Tch...`
` I know you think he might be dead.`
` Don't patronize me..."`
`"Do you know what people are calling his disappearance in Hinamizawa?"`
`"Huh?"`
`"...They say that he was demoned away..."`
`To be demoned away means the same thing as being spirited away.`
` It's part of the local dialect.`
`".........He was kidnapped and taken to Hell through the bottom of the Onigafuchi Swamp...?`
` That's ridiculous..."`
`"Anyway, the series of mysterious deaths has struck for the fourth time.`
`...It's too soon, but people are already talking about next year."`
`"Are you saying that the murder was the result of Oyashiro-sama's curse?"`
`"...The victim was one of the Houjous, after all.`
` She was involved in the dam conflict, though indirectly. `
`Really, it's not surprising that some people take an interest in the incidents, because they do always happen on the day of Watanagashi."`
`".........That's ridiculous too. Oyashiro-sama's curse?"`
`Though I said that, I couldn't quite wipe away the fear from my mind.`
`Why did Satoshi-kun disappear...?`
`Was it the Sonozaki family?`
`Did he run away from the police?`
`Did he really kill his aunt in the first place?`
`Why did he even disappear?`
`He's on his own.`
` Oyashiro-sama's curse has nothing to do with it.`
`But...`
` ......Hmm?`
` That's strange.`
`Satoshi-kun and Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
`......Somebody once mentioned those two together before.`
`...Hmm... when did I hear that...?`
`Ah, that's right...`
` That rainy day.`
`It was Rena Ryuugu who told me that`
` when we were taking shelter in that shack.`
`"Ah."`
`I remembered the creepy story that she told me at that time.`
`"Satoshi-kun wants to leave Hinamizawa and run far away...`
` even if only unconsciously..."`
`That's what Rena Ryuugu said.`
`Rena had definitely pointed out that Satoshi-kun wanted to leave Hinamizawa at that time.`
`She also said...`
`"Everything he's going through is... a sign of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`She said that`
` for sure.`
`She had definitely mentioned Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`The series of mysterious deaths has struck four times.`
`......Was Satoshi-kun being controlled by the curse? Is that why he killed his aunt and was 'demoned away'...?`
`.........No way.`
` That can't be true.`
`Satoshi-kun's smile faded away in my mind......`
`...I moved from one chair to another because the air conditioning was too cold.`
`I moved with my notebook, my pen case with a bunch of keychains, and my cup of milk tea.`
`I did it all in one go.`
`I sat down in a new chair, then opened my notebook again. I scribbled my thoughts and sank into silence.`
`The series of mysterious deaths.`
`Dubbed "the curse of Oyashiro-sama."`
`I've been viewing each incident as a separate case, even though it was followed by another one. I've never looked at all the cases as part of one big scheme.`
`After I wrote down all the incidents on paper, it became clear to me that all of them served the same agenda.`
`I wrote down the victims.`
`The first year: the construction site manager.`
`The second year: Satoshi-kun's parents.`
`The third year: the priest.`
`The fourth year: Satoshi-kun's aunt.`
`......For the fourth year, one could consider Satoshi-kun himself to be the victim, rather than his aunt.`
`If I considered that each case arose from the grudge over the dam conflict, it's quite simple.`
`In the first year.`
`The construction manager was killed because he was a symbol of the dam construction itself.`
`Of course, the real enemy was the Ministry of Construction, but it wasn't as clear a target.`
`That manager, on the other hand, had been aggressively shouting back at the villagers, so he was a more appropriate enemy to attack.`
`...If Oyashiro-sama had really cursed someone, it would have been the officials from the Ministry.`
`It's apparent that the target was selected based on the villagers' preference.`
`The second year.`
`The accidental death of Satoshi-kun's parents.`
`...It's said that they fell from a cliff in some park, but it's doubtful that it was really an accident.`
`His parents were labeled as 'traitors' to the village because they sided with the dam construction, even though they were also from Hinamizawa.`
`The Houjou family was ostracized during the dam conflict in order to prevent further pro-dam activists from rising up.`
`That means that the Houjous were 'necessary' during the conflict to play the role of the 'traitor.'`
`So, when the conflict was over...`
`...They no longer served any purpose.`
`The construction site manager was a symbol of the external enemy.`
`The Houjous were a symbol of the internal enemy.`
`Those people fell victim to the curse, and it seemed that the grudge over the dam conflict had ended.`
`Yet those incidents were followed by another one.`
`The third year.`
`The leader of one of the Three Families, the priest Furude, suddenly died of an illness with an unknown cause.`
`His wife drowned herself on the same night.`
`She seemed to have left a note that said she was sacrificing herself to pacify Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`Whether it was a fatal disease or suicide, their deaths looked suspicious.`
`Mion admitted that the Sonozaki family didn't like the priest's attitude.`
`They didn't like how the priest had been generous toward the pro-dam activists.`
`The priest wasn't quite a traitor, but he was certainly uncooperative.`
`Looking at these incidents, I realized that the 'curse' was performed based on the degree of hostility:`
` enemy,`
` traitor,`
` and dissident.`
`This meant that the curse was actually 'payment.'`
`It was a punishment for the criminals of war.`
`...And the fourth year.`
`I didn't understand this case at first, to be honest.`
`At first, I believed that this case was separate from the other ones, even though it occurred on the same day.`
`I never thought that there would be any relation to the other three.`
`But when I wrote it down and looked at it objectively...`
`......The victim is a 'relative of a traitor.'`
`After 'enemy,' 'traitor,' and 'dissident,' 'relative of a traitor' doesn't sound too odd.`
`It comes naturally as a fourth target.`
`On the day the villagers worship Oyashiro-sama, their guardian deity, the criminals of the dam conflict have been 'punished by the curse.'`
`Just like how I was forced to pay at the Sonozaki house, the criminals were made to pay as well.`
`...After writing these things out, I started thinking that the fourth incident might be in line with the series of mysterious deaths after all.`
`Whether it was Satoshi-kun or the dopehead,`
` it seemed that they were forced to play the role of a murderer, as a part of a bigger scenario.`
`Even if Satoshi-kun was the real culprit, even if he killed his aunt because of an ordinary grudge, `
`the murder seems synchronized with the grand scheme of 'the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa,' which is a payment plan for the war criminals.`
`...That murder was the result of his pain.`
`But... what if somebody planned that as part of a scenario...?`
`For instance...`
`Somebody might have suggested to him to kill his aunt on that day, that night, at that place......?`
`...I had no doubts that Satoshi-kun decided to kill her in order to protect Satoko.`
`But did he really reach that conclusion on his own?`
`Satoshi-kun was optimistic and somewhat detached, as far as I know. Would he really`
` have considered murdering his aunt`
` even if it was to protect his sister...?`
`Couldn't it be possible for somebody to have chosen the aunt as the fourth year's murder beforehand...?`
`...And they used Satoshi-kun?`
`And Satoshi-kun was eliminated because of his connection with them...?`
`Looking at it that way, the murder of the first year resembles this case.`
`The main culprit behind that case hasn't been found yet,`
` dead or alive.`
`The other culprits testified that their fight had turned into a slaughter...`
` but wouldn't it be possible that the main culprit had manipulated the situation?`
`What if he had been told to kill someone on that day, at that time, and in that place......?`
`I'm certain.`
` The first murder resembles Satoshi-kun's case very much.`
`So... did that mean Satoshi-kun was being controlled by somebody else...?`
`Ooishi had presented me with a hypothesis that the Sonozaki family made Satoshi-kun disappear, in order to end my relationship with a murderer.`
`...But when I read the notes I wrote down,`
` his disappearance didn't seem too spontaneous. It seemed like part of a bigger plan.`
`Since I'd unexpectedly gotten involved in that plan, I had to be separated from him.`
`Then Satoshi-kun was demoned away, as planned.`
`At first, I also believed that the Sonozaki family made him disappear because they didn't like that I was in love with a member of a family of traitors.`
`...But something didn't add up.`
` Something felt strange.`
`I wasn't the reason for his disappearance after all.`
`Even if I never met him in the first place...`
` Satoshi-kun was supposed to kill his aunt in June 1982, and then disappear.`
`At one point I had been thinking of taking revenge on the hag.`
`I'd believed that she separated us.`
`But what if my relationship with Satoshi-kun had nothing to do with his disappearance?`
`.........What would that mean?`
`...Who made Satoshi-kun disappear...?`
`I need to understand the series of mysterious deaths in order to solve this mystery.`
`What did all these deaths mean?`
` Who was behind them, and what purpose did they serve...?`
`I wanted to know the purpose, the motive,`
` and who was responsible...`
`Who took Satoshi-kun......?`
`I wanted to know if he was still alive.`
`...............`
`...The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa is also called "Oyashiro-sama's curse"...`
` What is that curse...?`
`Specifically,`
` what kind of god is Oyashiro-sama...?`
`What blessings does he bring and what punishments does he dole out...?`
`I wrote down my thoughts in the notebook.`
`What's Oyashiro-sama...? What is he...?`
` I scribbled these things down...`
`I was so absorbed by it...`
`That I didn't realize somebody had been standing behind me, watching me`
` the whole time.`
` I couldn't stop myself from gasping when I realized that.`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` Did I startle you...?`
` Hee hee."`
`The intelligent-looking woman giggled.`
`"N-No,`
` I was just a bit surprised...`
` Sorry about that."`
`She could have apologized a little better, too, since she'd been watching me from behind...`
`But she just stared at my face instead...`
`".........Are you Shion Sonozaki-san?"`
`".........You must know Sis since you know my name, but I don't know who you are."`
`Being twins is a pain sometimes.`
`People you've never met before can tell exactly who you are.`
`"Hee hee. I'm sorry.`
` The Sonozaki-san I know would never be seen in a library,`
` so I assumed that you were her twin sister."`
`The woman giggled again.`
`"Well, you were right. I'm Shion Sonozaki.`
` Nice to meet you.`
` May I ask your name?"`
`"Oh, I'm sorry. I should've introduced myself first."`
`She seemed to love her own hair, because she kept running her fingers through it boastfully.`
`"I'm Miyo Takano.`
` You can call me Miyo, Shion-chan."`
`"Nice to meet you, Takano-san."`
`Her condescending attitude bugged me.`
`I hate meeting people like that.`
`I closed my notebook and got ready to leave the desk.`
`"Oh... Are you upset?"`
`"Thank you for your concern.`
` I like to be alone when thinking, so I'm moving to another spot.`
` Excuse me."`
`"...That's a shame.`
` I thought we'd be good friends."`
`"Did you?`
` I don't think so."`
`"I finally met someone with the same passion. A fellow researcher of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` I think it's quite unusual to meet someone like that..."`
`She saw my notes...!`
` My face reddened.`
`"Th-These are just theories!`
` It's all nonsense.`
` Just childish scribbles."`
`"The series of mysterious deaths is also known as Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` Though each death is an independent incident, all of them clearly share the same purpose. `
`Each year, someone dies of the curse, and someone else is sacrificed and disappears..."`
`"Wh-What?`
` What are you saying all of a sudden?`
` Someone dies and... someone else... what...?"`
`I was taken aback by her weird spiel.`
`...But I realized right away that she'd said something extraordinary.`
`"Didn't you notice that the number of victims is always even...?`
` Haven't you realized that yet...?"`
`The number of victims is always even...??`
`I was confused, but I tried to figure out what that meant.`
`The dam construction site manager died in the first year.`
`There was only one victim.`
`In the second year, the victims were the parents of Satoshi-kun, so it was two people.`
`In the third year, it was the priest...`
` and if her death was also planned, his wife... two again...`
`And in this year, the fourth year, Satoshi-kun's aunt died and Satoshi-kun went missing...`
`If Satoshi-kun's disappearance was planned... the number of the victims was two.`
`...It's true.`
` Except for the first one, the victims always came in an even number--two.`
`Wait.`
`...I had just concluded myself that the first case resembled the fourth one.`
`The main culprit was still missing. He might have been demoned away, just like Satoshi-kun.`
`"....................."`
`"See?`
` Doesn't it make sense now?"`
`Takano-san sounded like a teacher who had showed me how to solve a difficult math problem...`
` I wasn't quite convinced, but I couldn't deny what she'd said, either.`
`"Did I give you enough hints...?`
` I really would have enjoyed a conversation with you, but I think you prefer being alone.`
`...Hee hee hee."`
`"......I'm sorry that I wasn't respectful, Miyo-san.`
` Please call me Shion."`
`"...Pff...... Hee hee hee...!"`
`She seemed content that I changed my attitude. She kept giggling for a while.`
`She didn't seem that reliable.`
` I didn't want to be acquainted with her for too long.`
`But... I don't get to talk to people very much...`
` and what she said interested me.`
`"Let me introduce myself again.`
` I'm Miyo Takano.`
` Call me Miyo."`
`"Pleased to meet you, Miyo-san.`
` I'm Shion Sonozaki.`
` Mion's twin sister.`
` Please call me Shion."`
`I took the hand that Miyo-san held out as a sign of reconciliation.`
`"Please tell me more.`
` You said that there are always two victims?`
` One dies due to the curse and the other one is... a sacrifice?"`
`"...Shion-chan.`
` Before we get into that, could you tell me why you became interested in this?"`
`She leaned over and looked into my eyes...`
` It was kind of uncomfortable.`
`"...Miyo-san, how much do you know about me?`
` I guess you have an idea if you know my name..."`
`"I don't know much...`
` Just that you recently returned from a boarding school..."`
`"I see.`
` So, I think you can imagine`
` that I want to know about the series of mysterious deaths`
` that happened while I was away.`
` I'm just curious."`
`"...I see.`
` You're curious, eh?"`
`I got the impression that she knew about what happened to Satoshi-kun and me,`
` because she instantly recognized me as Shion, not Mion.`
`...I didn't know why I thought that way, as she shouldn't have access to the sources that, for instance, Ooishi does.`
`It was just the look in her eyes that made me think that way...`
`"Let me ask you a question this time.`
` You called me a fellow researcher of Oyashiro-sama's curse, didn't you?`
` So why are you researching the curse? `
`You also stated that there's always an even number of victims in the mysterious deaths.`
` It's true that Hinamizawa's mysterious deaths are often called Oyashiro-sama's curse, `
`but why would you delve into the mysterious deaths if you're researching the curse itself?"`
`"Shion-chan, you're asking too many questions at once.`
` I can't tell what you really want to know."`
`Ooh...`
` I couldn't say anything in return.`
`Maybe I'd been too inquisitive.`
`"I'll answer your questions one by one......`
` I'm not just researching the curse, as my subject is much broader than that. `
`I'm researching the history of Onigafuchi Village.`
` In plain terms, I'm researching the dark and ancient history of Hinamizawa."`
`"Onigafuchi Village??`
` Isn't Onigafuchi the bottomless swamp some people believe is connected to Hell?`
` And what dark history...?"`
`I kept asking questions.`
`Miyo-san, however, looked pleased to hear them.`
`"Onigafuchi Village is the old name for Hinamizawa, as it was known back before the Meiji Era.`
` About the dark history...`
` you know a little bit about the man-eating demons, I assume?"`
`...Ah...`
` the man-eating demons, huh?`
`That was a fairytale told in Hinamizawa.`
`A long time ago, demons came out of the swamp, and while the villagers battled with them,`
` they ended up living peacefully together. `
`The villagers transcended and became a sacred people, having demon blood in their veins.`
`That long-forgotten fairy tale came back to my mind vividly.`
`"You know this story because you're a villager, of course.`
` But what about the story of the cannibal banquet?"`
`"Eh...?`
` What's that?"`
`"You know that the villagers have the blood of man-eating demons in their veins, don't you?"`
`"...Yeah... I think I've heard of it..."`
`I dodged the question.`
`Hinamizawa used to be a desolate village, but it grew in prominence after the Second World War, and expanded its influence to Okinomiya and other areas.`
`The people who disliked and discriminated against the villagers called us 'man-eating demons.' I remember that.`
`The young villagers don't take it seriously, but the older people can get seriously upset about it.`
` They certainly can't take it as a joke.`
`So the term 'man-eating demons' is forbidden. We normally never use it.`
`Even during my rebellious phase, I never spoke those words.`
`Miyo-san, however, seemed to have no qualms with saying it out loud.`
`"...Are you upset?"`
`"About what?"`
`"...I know people hate that phrase in Hinamizawa.`
` I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable."`
`"The old people wouldn't like it, but I'm fine...`
` Would you continue?"`
`"Thanks.`
` Okay, so...`
` The ancient villagers had a custom of cannibalism.`
` They ritualized this custom and held various ceremonies based around it.`
` The festival we hold in June isn't just an early summer festival. `
`It used to be a banquet in which the villagers chased after a sacrifice and ate them...`
` They bound the sacrifice to a table, gutted them, and dumped the organs into a river. `
`'Wata' can mean 'cotton,' but it also means 'organs.'`
` That's the root of the word 'Watanagashi.'"`
`"Organ drifting... Watanagashi..."`
`"Indeed.`
` I believe they started using futon mats to cover it all up around the Meiji Era, according to my research.`
` They wouldn't be able to do that openly nowadays."`
`"........."`
`...Everything Miyo-san was talking about sounded... startling.`
`I was just taken aback.`
`I couldn't wholly believe it right away. She sensed that from my expression.`
`"It's not a hoax. I didn't make any of this up.`
` If you promise not to tell anyone, I can show you my notes on Watanagashi..."`
`Miyo-san took out a notebook from her bag and flipped through it.`
`She appeared to be doing her research thoroughly.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'd love to read it."`
`"Sure.`
` I'd like to keep it confidential...`
`......Hee hee, but I guess I should share it with my fellow researcher."`
`Miyo-san handed me the notebook a bit hesitantly.`
`It looked like it'd take a whole night to finish reading.`
`It was densely packed with information.`
`I saw copies of various documents and quotes in there too. It wasn't just some delusion of hers.`
`"...You told me`
` that one person dies because of the curse and another person is sacrificed and disappears, right?"`
`A person is sacrificed and disappears.`
`...Satoshi-kun had gone missing.`
`......Did he become a sacrifice...?`
` What is a sacrifice anyway...?`
`Miyo-san looked pleased to hear my questions again. She took out another notebook and handed it to me.`
`"I think you'll understand once you read it, but I'll give you a digest version...`
` Oyashiro-sama's curse is simply Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`In other words, the curse is caused by Oyashiro-sama's anger,`
` do you follow?"`
`"Yes......`
` You're saying that Oyashiro-sama was mad at the people who opposed the village during the dam conflict, and that's why the curse occurred."`
`"That's right.`
` Oyashiro-sama's anger has to be pacified.`
` If not, something even worse will occur. `
`So, all the successive priests at the Furude Shrine had to perform a sacrifice every time the curse struck, in order to pacify Oyashiro-sama.`
` It's called a sacrificial ritual."`
`"So...... each year on the day of Watanagashi, one person dies because of the curse,`
` and another one is sacrificed to pacify Oyashiro-sama's anger?!`
` But only one person is actually murdered each time. `
`I've never heard of human sacrifices being made!"`
`"Naturally, there's no body.`
` The ritual of sacrifice requires the offering be sunk into Onigafuchi Swamp.`
` That swamp is bottomless, and no one would ever surface once they were thrown in there. `
`...No body would never be found, of course."`
`"So... one of the victims is always thrown into the swamp every year...?"`
`Does that mean Satoshi-kun is also at the bottom of that dark green swamp...?`
`"I don't know...`
` I'm not sure that they really throw them into the swamp.`
` But those who make these incidents happen must be eliminating one person based on that legend."`
`Each year a traitor to the village dies on the day of Watanagashi because of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`And another person is sacrificed in order to pacify Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`...That person's body will never be found, because he or she is supposedly thrown into the bottomless swamp.`
`"Yes, you get it...`
` The series of mysterious deaths always involves both the curse and the sacrifice.`
` It's a system that allows two traitors to die every year."`
`"....................."`
`"What I'm telling you now probably isn't sufficient,`
` so it might be hard to grasp.`
` Instead, I want you to take the time to read my notes.`
` You'll see that what I'm telling you isn't far from the truth at all..."`
`I heard a man's voice just then.`
`A middle-aged man with a hat was waving at Miyo-san from the entrance.`
`"...Sorry, I think I have to go.`
` I wanted to talk to you more,`
` but... I guess we'll have another chance to chat.`
` I'll leave those notes to you.`
`I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions."`
`Miyo-san wrapped up the conversation and headed to where the man was waiting for her.`
`She left her old notebooks in my hands.`
`Miyo-san waved at me as she left the library with her companion.`
`...I took a seat again and opened what she'd given me...`
`What bugged me was the series of mysterious deaths,`
` also known as the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Maybe I'd be able to get closer to the truth by reading these notebooks...`
`If I studied them carefully, I might be able to find out who was really behind the incidents. `
`Why did Satoshi-kun have to disappear...? What was he involved in? How did that happen...?`
`Maybe Takano's notes would bring me the answer.`
`......Research notes - Miyo Takano`
`I started flipping the pages, this time making sure that no one was watching over my shoulder......`
