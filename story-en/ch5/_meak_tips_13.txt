`That underground torture room is officially called the underground ritual storehouse.`
`So, do "torture room" and "ritual storehouse" mean the same thing?`
`According to Takano-san's theory, bloody rituals, including Watanagashi, have been passed down among the Three Families even after the Meiji Era.`
`The rituals are always ready to be performed.`
`Their form of worship always revolved around torture,`
` so Hinamizawa's history involved a great deal of human slaughter.`
`Takano-san's theory is correct.`
`The underground storehouse at the Sonozaki house looked well maintained.`
`Takano-san is right about that, too.`
`Since the Sonozaki family and the Furude family both have ritual storehouses, the Kimiyoshi family must have one, too.`
`After all, these ancient and brutal customs are still handed down through the generations.`
`I should remain armed with the knowledge that occult events are still secretly being performed in this cursed village...`
