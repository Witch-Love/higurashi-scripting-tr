`The game piece that uncovers the invisible Rule Y that has been pulling the strings from the beginning.`
`Because the impression of that is so strong, it's easy to forget about something very important.`
`We can't forget that this piece also shows the path towards destroying Rule Z.`
`While Rika Furude lamented Rule Z as impossible to defeat, it was hardly a match for Keiichi Maebara and the others once they learned everything they needed to.`
`They knew the correct way to fight, and fought according to the rules of the game board.`
`As a result, we win, and that fact is more valuable than anything for us.`
`Keiichi Maebara taught me a lesson.`
` There is no need to subject ourselves to any fate.`
` The will to believe can defeat anything.`
`The fate that I was always subjected to was created by Miyo Takano's own conviction.`
` So what he says is correct.`
`To defeat her conviction, we need a stronger conviction of our own.`
`A strong will can be pierced only by another strong will.`
`We defeated Rules X and Z and then challenged the final rule, Rule Y...`
` but we needed more pieces.`
`Each piece fought at its best, but the strength of our enemies' pieces, led by Miyo Takano, were just too powerful.`
`She didn't even give us mercy. She squished us completely, and made us restart the game all over again.`
`Although we lost, we didn't give up the resolve in our hearts.`
`Because we've finally found the true culprit, and also found a clue for how to fight against her.`
`We can't win with the pieces we have now.`
`We don't have a powerful enough conviction or a strong enough will.`
`But Hanyuu and I will keep trying.`
`We'll roll our die repeatedly,`
` look for the greatest result,`
` collect pieces,`
` and try again.`
` With a will stronger than Takano.`
`Didn't you think of giving up several times before you got to this point?`
`But you made it because you believed in me and followed me here.`
`We're almost there. We can do it.`
`Let's create the last piece.`
`It will be the ultimate piece, and we won't need anything else.`
` The very last piece of all.`
`Come on, let's collect the pieces.`
` Let's collect miracles.`
`Please give your hopes, desires, and dreams to me...`
