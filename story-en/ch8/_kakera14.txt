`Satoko-chan's dissection plan has been scrubbed, and we are getting ready to administer an almost totally untested medicine, C103.`
`This experimental medicine suppresses the production of a certain type of hormone and, in doing so, it will stop the transmission of the syndrome triggering Satoko-chan's condition.`
`The mechanism of Hinamizawa Syndrome is as follows: the pathogen takes over the frontal lobe of the patient's brain, and then induces increased responsiveness to paranoia. `
`As a result, a patient voluntarily carries out excessively defensive behaviors, to a problematic extent.`
`If this induction can be cut off, then it'll be possible to save terminal patients from becoming deranged.`
`But it only cuts off an induction, so it's not really a cure.`
`...Ironically, the brain is an organ that learns.`
`Once the brain has learned to be excessively paranoid due to the Hinamizawa Syndrome, even after the pathogen is eliminated, the brain doesn't simply unlearn that paranoia.`
`In short, even if the pathogen doesn't induce derangement, the patient will be directed to such emotions of their own volition.`
`...Thus, it is impossible to completely escape the nearly-deranged L5 state.`
`(The proverb, "a burnt child dreads the fire," is a good example of this.`
` Even after the burn on your tongue heals, the fear of being burned by food again remains. `
`When it ends up being a good thing, we call it "learning a lesson", and we call it "trauma" when it doesn't.)`
`We predict Satoko-chan's treatment will take a significantly long time; requiring both medication, such as administering psychotropics, and mental care, like counseling.`
`We have to slowly unravel her mind's solidified paranoia while also suppressing the syndrome's induction of derangement.`
`...This is the treatment plan for terminal patients like Satoko-chan.`
`However, as we are going to stimulate the parts of her brain that affect her emotions while they are being stimulated by the pathogen at the same time,`
`it's possible there could be unexpected side effects.`
` Both her mental and physical strength hold the key to our success.`
`We were going to begin the experiment once she regains her emotional stability and physical strength, but...`
`Someone who threatens to disturb her emotional stability has been coming here every day.`
`...Ooishi, the sly old detective from the Okinomiya police department.`
`He thinks everything, from the dam protests to the dismemberment murder of the construction manager, is an organized effort secretly conducted by the Three Families of the village. `
`He even thinks the accident involving Satoko-chan's parents wasn't an accident. That's why he keeps coming back so he can talk to Satoko-chan.`
`"No matter how many times you come, I won't let you see her.`
` She's still crippled by the shock of her parents' deaths.`
` Can't you understand what she's been going through?"`
`"I understand. I only need a few minutes with her, really.`
` It won't take long at all.`
` If you want me to get a warrant, I will. But that's pretty serious, you know? `
`I'm being considerate of Houjou-san, and that's why I haven't gotten a warrant."`
`"What are you trying to ask her anyway? I don't really understand."`
`"...Hmm, well, actually...`
` It's possible that the fall was not an accident."`
`"I know the Houjou couple were hated by the whole village after the business with the dam.`
` But who would actually follow them on their trip and push them off? Don't you think that's absurd?"`
`"Hmmmmm.`
` Well, we could call it an accident.`
` But if that was the case, there are some things which just don't make sense.`
` Why lie?`
` With those lies, I don't think it was an accident."`
`"What lies?"`
`"Well,`
` Satoko Houjou-san said she was asleep in the car at the time of the accident.`
` ...I think that story sounds a little off, doesn't it?"`
`Satoko-chan claims she was asleep in the back seat when the accident took place.`
`So she didn't get out of the car at the viewing platform.`
`When she woke up, she didn't see her parents.`
` Then she found out they had fallen off the cliff.`
`"Where is the lie, exactly?`
` You aren't saying Satoko-chan wasn't really asleep and she went over to the viewing platform with her parents, are you?"`
`"That's right.`
` Satoko Houjou-san was never asleep.`
` She got out of the car with her parents and went to the viewing platform."`
`......I'm suddenly hit by a terrible possibility.`
`If what Ooishi says is true, and Satoko-chan is saying she didn't go to the viewing platform even though she actually did...`
` It's terrible to even imagine.`
`"Why are you saying such a thing?`
` Besides, why would Satoko-chan lie?"`
`"That's just it.`
` Why would Satoko Houjou-san lie?`
` That's why I need to talk to her.`
` ...Otherwise, this won't end as just a simple accident."`
`"Why are you convinced that Satoko-chan is lying?"`
`"This accident took place in a different jurisdiction. The guys from the Shirakawa station conducted the interviews with the parties involved.`
` There are things that bother me in their report."`
`"Bother you... Like what?"`
`"According to Satoko Houjou-san's statement,`
` her parents asked her to come with them to the viewing platform, but she was sleepy, so she didn't get out of the car.`
` Then she fell asleep and woke up after a while. `
`She became concerned because her parents hadn't come back, and started to cry.`
` One of the park workers on patrol noticed her crying and talked to her, and that's how the accident was discovered.`
`And at that time, guess what?`
` According to the park worker's testimony, she was the one who first said her parents had fallen off the cliff. `
`But, you see, it's hard to see the accident site in question from where the car was parked.`
` If you look very carefully, you might be able to notice the broken fence.`
`But still, you know...`
` I think it's odd to say your parents had fallen off a cliff just because you didn't see them when you woke up. `
`Normally, most people would say something like their parents went for a walk and didn't come back. `
`It just doesn't make sense to me that she told a stranger that her parents had fallen off a cliff without even being at the site of the accident!`
`I want to ask her why she was so certain that her parents had fallen off a cliff. That's why I keep coming back here. `
`I asked her many times before she was admitted here, but all she said was that she doesn't remember or that she was confused at the time. Sounds like a politician, huh? `
`That's why I think it's worth taking that time to talk to her."`
`That terrifying possibility has turned to certainty in my head.`
`I'd assumed that her parents' accident triggered her terminal symptoms.`
`...But no.`
`Satoko-chan had already gone terminal, and just before the accident, her heart was filled with paranoia that drove her mad.`
`She was under a lot of stress because of her bad relationship with her stepfather.`
`She was also being scolded by her mother for not being able to get along with him.`
`...If that made her paranoid, made her think her parents considered her to be a bother and were going to kill her...`
`When they went to the viewing platform, she must have thought they were going to push her off the cliff.`
`Then a tragedy took place, and she pushed her parents off instead, although she considered it to have been self-defense.`
`I'm certain of that`
` because I know Hinamizawa Syndrome better than anybody.`
`This accident isn't an accident.`
`...It isn't a crime either, like Ooishi is thinking.`
`It is simply`
` a tragedy.`
`When I talked to Satoshi-kun about the family, I was even more convinced.`
`He told me even though Satoko-chan refused to open up to her stepfather, he had tried to communicate with her.`
`It's true their relationship didn't go well in the beginning.`
`Satoko-chan caused trouble repeatedly, and even called the city's child abuse hotline.`
`At that point, they received guidance from the child consultation center, and they pointed out that the problem lay in lack of communication between daughter and stepfather.`
`So the stepfather took a parenting course under the social worker's guidance, and awkward though it was, he made efforts to communicate with her.`
`Satoshi-kun noticed his efforts, so he tried to talk to Satoko-chan about it.`
`But Satoko-chan didn't notice them at all.`
`The excessive stress she was under triggered terminal symptoms...... and she couldn't understand her stepfather's remorse.`
`...On the contrary, her stepfather's change created even more mistrust within her.`
`As a result...`
` they went to enjoy the beautiful view of the Shirakawa Nature Park as a family`
` and to share in that joy...`
` Yet that humble, ordinary family's wish...`
` couldn't even get through to Satoko-chan.`
`...What a tragic misunderstanding...`
`Satoko-chan stayed in the car telling her parents that she wanted to sleep, but then she got out and snuck up behind them.`
`I bet he heard her footsteps.`
`He pretended not to notice her, `
`thinking that she was doing that to surprise him.`
`...It's sad just thinking about what must have ran through his mind.`
`While he thought he had finally gotten through to her,`
` she was actually approaching him with the intent to kill.`
`But that's not Satoko-chan's true nature.`
`It's the disease.`
`Satoko-chan isn't the only one who is to be pitied. Her parents are its victims, too.`
`And now, Ooishi thinks she's a criminal.`
`Judgment and punishment are required for crimes with malicious intent.`
`But what she really needs is understanding and sympathy.`
`And no one has that understanding. Except for me, because I know about Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`I am the director of the Irie Institute, but I've never behaved as such or exercised that authority.`
`But I'm going to do so for the first time since taking the position.`
`I'm not doing it as the head of the Irie Institute, the secret research organization.`
`I'm doing it as a doctor, so I can protect Satoko-chan.`
`"It's about the Houjou family's accident at the Shirakawa Nature Park...`
` Do you think you can ask Okonogi-san from the Mountain Dogs to make it out to be an accident?"`
`"Sure, of course. That's no problem.`
` The Mountain Dogs are a unit specialized in concealment and manipulation, after all. `
`We have to put an end to it quickly, otherwise the police will end up getting closer to finding out about our research."`
`"...That's right.`
` Please make especially sure Ooishi-san is drawn away from this case.`
` We're at a delicate stage of the drug administration test.`
` She doesn't need any more unnecessary stress."`
`"You're absolutely right.`
` I'll let the Mountain Dogs know.`
` I've heard they even have connections within the police, so I'll give the order to put pressure on them, too. `
`I'm sure the accident in Shirakawa will be concluded as exactly that within a few days."`
`With that, it was declared an accident.`
`If only it really was one, it would have eased Satoko-chan's soul...`
`Getting rid of the pathogen can't heal that wounded soul.`
`Nor can it erase the tragedy that had already taken place.`
`All I can do is my best, `
`so the day she regains her smile comes sooner.`
