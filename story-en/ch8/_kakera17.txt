`I've wanted to become a doctor ever since I was little.`
`Doctors make a lot of money.`
` People look up to doctors.`
` I think those are the kind of reasons I had.`
`So when I played with my friends, I always acted like a doctor.`
`I cleaned their wounds and applied ice packs when my friends sprained their ankles, using what I learned from household medical books.`
`Everyone, including me, believed that I'd be a doctor one day.`
`My family was poor, so they praised me for that goal.`
`They told me that I needed to study a lot to become a doctor, so they borrowed some pseudo-medical books from the local library for me.`
`The rental fees weren't cheap.`
`So I would speed-read one book in a day and the next day, my parents would go back to the store to exchange it for a different book, saying they accidentally borrowed a book they already borrowed before. By doing so, my parents borrowed two books for the price of one.`
`Of course, now I know those books were rather useless, but they were highly motivational just the same.`
`My neighbors called me Dr. Kyousuke-kun, and I was always picked for class health officer at school.`
`Even my teachers helped me with the classes I needed to take to become a doctor.`
`Of course, in reality, becoming a doctor isn't as easy as it might seem.`
`I had to study diligently, and the path was most definitely rough.`
`To become a doctor, one must attend college.`
`Since my family was poor, I was told I wasn't allowed to go to an expensive private school.`
` So I had to be admitted to a national public university.`
`My grades weren't bad, but the admission rate to national public universities is very marginal.`
`Especially since I wanted to go to a medical school, my chances were even smaller.`
`...I studied like crazy.`
`My only driving force was my childhood dream of becoming a doctor.`
`The dream of becoming a doctor and to be looked up to by everyone kept me going.`
`...And I was admitted.`
`I wasn't at the top of the list, but I made it in. I was finally at the starting point of making my childhood dream come true.`
`My parents were thrilled.`
`Neither my father nor mother went to college, so they were proud of their son getting into a public medical school. They invited our relatives over to celebrate.`
`Although it was a public university, tuition wasn't cheap. But they still had an extravagant celebration anyway.`
`My father didn't express his emotions much.`
`He always kept a straight face.`
` He rarely voiced his opinion or took initiative on anything.`
`My mother took care of everything, and he showed up last and left without saying a word. He was the typical stern and silent Japanese father of the time.`
`That's why I was surprised to see him shedding tears of joy, and I cried along with him.`
`He went around to all my relatives while repeatedly slapping my back saying how proud and lucky he was to have a son like me. He bragged about my achievements to all who would hear them.`
`The celebration became my farewell party as I was about to leave for Tokyo.`
`My father yelled "banzai" repeatedly at the station as the train pulled away.`
`I was a little embarrassed...`
` but when I could no longer see my father, I could clearly recall the tears pouring down.`
`The days of hellish studying and exams began after that.`
`Some days, I was tempted to just give up and submit myself to the lavish lifestyle of the city.`
`But the letters from my family always encouraged me and gave me the strength to go on.`
`My dream, then, was to open up my own clinic in my hometown so I could contribute to the region.`
`I never even dreamed of getting involved with brains.`
`One day, I noticed a difference in a letter from my family.`
`The letter said the usual things about how it was at home, and asked how I was doing.`
` But the postscript was what caught my attention.`
`"Your father has become really violent lately.`
` Sometimes he turns the house upside down, and I don't know what to do..."`
`...I just couldn't picture him acting viciously. I was extremely surprised.`
`Did something happen?`
`...But, in the postscript, my mother said that there was nothing she could think of.`
`My mother and father had been together for a long time.`
` They'd been together since well before I was born.`
`So she noticed things that I couldn't.`
`...She couldn't even think of a reason why my father had become so violent......`
` What happened?`
`They got along so well. They were such a lovely couple.`
`When I caused a problem for my mother when I was little, my father only bonked my head with his knuckle.`
` Why was he acting this way towards my mother?`
`Maybe there was some kind of misunderstanding between them.`
`......I was going home for the New Year.`
` Maybe I could have a good talk with him then.`
`But the situation was a lot more serious than I thought.`
`On one cold winter day,`
` I found my apartment door unlocked.`
`I thought someone had broke in... but I found my mother in my apartment with her luggage.`
`...That's right.`
` My mother could no longer take my father's fury, and came to stay with me.`
`This was back when people still believed in the proverb "a woman has no place to settle down all her life".`
`She couldn't go back to her own family, because they lived in the same region as my father, so she came all the way to Tokyo.`
`I heard about my father's violence from my mother's own lips.`
`She cried, saying she had no idea why such a quiet man changed like that.`
`She said she wasn't ever going back to him.`
`I didn't know what to do.`
`...I asked her if she could talk to him one more time, but the bruises on her body told me it was no use.`
`To remember what happened afterwards is too much, so I'll be brief.`
`After my mother left, my father thought she was having an affair and went over to the neighbor's house with a wooden sword.`
` He was arrested.`
`He was released immediately, but he assumed someone in the neighborhood was hiding her, so he did the same thing repeatedly.`
`He eventually reached the point of getting into fights with anyone he saw.`
` In the end, he picked a fight with some young punks and ended up being beaten to death.`
`My relatives gave my father a decent funeral, but my mother didn't attend.`
`It's no use beating a dead horse.`
`So, nobody said anything negative about my father, but everyone was simply puzzled as to why he changed so much.`
`What I heard from my relatives about my father's final days was a lot stranger than what I heard from my mother.`
`My mother only told me about his sudden rage and violence.`
`But my relatives told me, `
`he also laughed and grew sad.`
`...Apparently, he displayed several sudden fluctuations of emotion, especially so in his last years.`
`They also told me that he started to complain about headaches after an accident he had.`
`...My father was a construction worker.`
`He had hit his head hard on a construction board during an accident at work.`
`He regained his consciousness quickly and seemed fine...`
` But since the accident, he started to have headaches and behave abnormally.`
`I sensed the connection between the accident and my father's changes, so I talked to my professor after I went back to Tokyo.`
`"...Hmm.`
` I can't say for certain, but it sounds like it's possible your father suffered some kind of brain damage.`
` There's a chance that blow to his head caused an organic mental disorder. `
`The symptoms your father showed in his final years are similar to the delirium and mental fluctuations we've often seen in similar patients."`
`Human behavior is created by the brain.`
` And if the brain is damaged, it can cause erratic behavior.`
`In other words, my father wasn't crazy: he was suffering from a disorder.`
`"If you can perform an autopsy on him, you should check his brain carefully.`
` Maybe you'll find something like a tumor there."`
`My father had already been cremated.`
` So there was no way of knowing.`
`But hearing about his behavior, I knew for sure.`
`That was the only way to explain why such a quiet and gentle man would change.`
`......I tried to explain all this to my relatives to regain my father's honor, but hardly anyone understood.`
`If his brain was damaged, he would've been dead.`
`But he was alive and well.`
`So the accident didn't damage his brain.`
`It wasn't his brain that caused him to change, it was his mind.`
` They simply brushed it off like that.`
`...This is the perception most people have about the brain.`
`They don't realize the mind and the brain are connected.`
`Most of the relatives didn't believe me.`
` ...But there was one person who I really wanted to, anyway.`
`......That was my mother.`
`As she got older, she grew senile`
` and she exaggerated the abuse she had to endure.`
`...All she did was criticize my father.`
`And every time, she ended up crying, lamenting that she married him.`
`They were a lovely couple.`
`We were a great family.`
`That's why I wanted to convey to her that she was misunderstanding the situation with my father.`
`My father's behavior was caused by his brain damage.`
`...What he did to her was very sad, but he didn't want to be that way.`
` I told her that he wasn't at fault.`
`But... my mother didn't understand.`
`Before she took her last breaths, I begged her to forgive my father.`
`But her final words were "please don't bury me next to that man".`
`......My father wasn't at fault.`
`He was simply the victim of a brain disorder.`
`You don't complain to a person who's coughing because he has a cold.`
`Because coughing is just a symptom, and he should be sympathized with.`
`In my father's case, the symptoms weren't as obvious as a cough.`
` ...They took the form of changes in personality, which are much harder to recognize.`
`If I had studied the brain more, I could have explained it better to my mother so that she could have understood him.`
` Then they could've been a nice couple again in heaven.`
`...When I realized that, I cried.`
`And I also realized that there are plenty of people like my father in this world`
` who are suffering from a disorder, yet they are misunderstood and despised for it.`
`And then I found out.`
`I found out about a miraculous cure for such disorders called a 'lobotomy'.`
`Ever since that day, I spent my days learning about the brain, so I could help people who are suffering from mental illnesses.`
`My father is gone.`
` But if he was still alive, I could cure him myself.`
`So he and my mother could reconcile.`
`That's the main reason`
` why I am here.`
