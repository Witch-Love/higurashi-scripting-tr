`My harsh and brutal days`
` are still continuing without end.`
`The situation between my aunt and Satoko remains the same.`
`My aunt yells at Satoko for no reason every night.`
`Although Satoko cries, she still talks back to her.`
`So my aunt's yelling goes on and on forever.`
`Satoko's crying goes on and on too.`
`When Satoko sees me, she grabs on to me.`
`She hides behind my back and tries to ignore my aunt's yelling.`
` She always comes to seek my help.`
`...Satoko doesn't open up to anyone, but me.`
`So if I don't protect her, she'll be devastated.`
`That security is something our parents didn't grant to Satoko. I have to be the one to provide it.`
`But`
` every day,`
` day after day.`
`Every time Satoko cries,`
` every day,`
` day after day.`
`...Satoko grabbed on to me while crying yesterday.`
`I patted her head. But, along with pity, `
`a different emotion came to me.`
`I wanted to grasp her head`
` and smash her against the wall.`
` What an unbelievably devilish and awful emotion.`
`No, no, no...`
` I can't think that...!!`
`No, it's not that I can't think it. I just can't acknowledge that feeling.`
`Since that day, there has been someone else inside of me.`
`That someone is trying to eat me up from the inside and switch places with me.`
`When Satoko begs for my help while crying,`
` that person tries to make me spill out some awful and hateful words that are sure to damage Satoko forever.`
`Leave me alone.`
` Don't grab on to me.`
` Go away!!`
` No, no, no, no, I can't, I can't, I can't!!!`
`To prevent him from taking over my body,`
` I clenched`
` my stomach`
` and drove him out.`
` ...I managed to do that.`
`But that wasn't it.`
`That person is coming after me, trying to get back inside of me.`
`I won't let such a scary thing get back inside of me.`
`He knows there's no room to slip into my heart as long as I keep it held shut like this.`
`......So, he's stopped trying`
` and instead is following right behind me.`
` He's waiting for me to let my guard down.`
`When I walk...`
` he walks right behind me.`
` He's breathing down my neck.`
`He follows me everywhere and when I lie down, he stares down at me.`
`He's waiting for the right moment to jump back inside of me, so he can hurt Satoko.`
`It's been so hot lately.`
`Maybe the heat is getting to me, and that's why I think things like this.`
`I'm the only family Satoko has.`
`...So I'll have to protect her from my aunt for the rest of my life.`
` That's my eternal duty...`
`The rest of my life?`
` Forever?`
` Do I really have to do that forever?`
`If only Satoko...`
`But I'm her only family...`
`But...`
`It's because of my aunt...`
`But it's because of the villagers too...`
`It's almost Watanagashi.`
`Some irresponsible people are saying that the curse will once again fall upon Hinamizawa.`
`They're also saying it'll fall upon me and Satoko for sure.`
`...Maybe it's just my imagination, but lately the villagers "expecting it" are giving me especially sharp looks.`
`I feel like I'll be killed on the day of Watanagashi.`
`Of course, there is no reason why I would be killed, and it's just my imagination.`
` Ah, pat, pat, pat, pat.`
` Don't come inside of me...`
`Satoko is my only sister and my family, so don't tell me those awful things...`
` Pat, pat, pat, pat, stop, stop, don't come this way, don't come this way!!! `
`The footsteps came up right behind me, and the hand touched me on the shoulder...!!!`
`"Aaaah!`
` ......Oh, Rena..."`
`"A...... Are you okay?`
` Are you?"`
`I must have been acting weird.`
` Rena looked worried.`
`Her name is Rena Ryuugu.`
` She just moved here and transferred to my school.`
`Nobody remembers her, but supposedly she lived here in Hinamizawa a long time ago.`
`In fact, she hardly remembers anything about Hinamizawa either.`
`Since Mion is the only other classmate who is my age, I'm glad she's my friend.`
`She usually carries on happily alongside Mion, but occasionally she shows more feminine consideration.`
`"Are you feeling okay?`
` Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?`
` ...Do you?"`
`"Thank you.`
` I'm okay.`
` Do I look sick or something?"`
`"Yep."`
`Her immediate answer made me realize I wasn't myself.`
`"......Is it about Satoko-chan?`
` ...Are you worried?"`
`"No... that isn't it."`
`She knows that my problem isn't physical, but a mental one.`
`This is just something I think to myself, but even though Rena seems like a very easygoing person, maybe she's more perceptive than she appears.`
`"...Since I just transferred here recently, I may not be able to help much...`
` But I can at least listen.`
` Sometimes talking can help."`
`Although she just transferred, she already knows quite a bit about me and my sister, and also about the situation with the villagers.`
`But... talking about it won't solve anything.`
`Actually,`
` if I talk about it, I feel like I'd be admitting to my weakness,`
` which might give that person a chance to get inside of me again...`
`"You were so surprised just now.`
` That's why I thought something really serious was bothering you...`
` Hauu..."`
`"Oh, that...... ahahaha.`
` Lately, I feel like someone is following me all the time.`
` ......Pit, pit, pat, pat.`
` I thought that was you...`
` Ahahahahaha, sorry.`
` I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore."`
`"......Footsteps?`
` ...Following you...?"`
`"...Eh?"`
`"...I...`
` I know those.`
` I know those footsteps."`
