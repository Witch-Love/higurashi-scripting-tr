`It was long.`
` It really was long.`
`Are you okay?`
` Is your spirit still alive?`
`Do we have all the pieces we want lined up on the game board?`
`Is this everything we have that can go up against Takano and her minions in the game of fate in the June of 1983?`
`I think,`
` maybe,`
` we have everything.`
`And last but not least, Hanyuu,`
` it's you.`
`The time you have left to be a piece is limited.`
`But that doesn't mean you can't show up in the game.`
`...Shall we begin?`
`I've put in hundreds of years just for this moment.`
