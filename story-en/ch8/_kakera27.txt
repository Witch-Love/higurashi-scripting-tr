`The gathering place inside of the Furude Shrine is in fact the headquarters of the Onigafuchi Guardians.`
`Normally, a shrine should be a calm and quiet place, but there are anti-dam signs everywhere, making it very obvious what this location has become.`
`There are over thirty members of the Guardians here at the moment, and they are having a heated conversation about their plans for the future.`
`Although this meeting place is on the Furude family's property, it's a community facility, so it closes at nine PM.`
`Of course, sometimes a discussion gets so heated that it goes on past closing time, but meetings are supposed to end by nine.`
`If a discussion ends early, they usually chitchat until that time.`
` That's what usually happens.`
`Of course, they mostly talk about the dam even when they chitchat.`
`They talk about someone's mistreatment at the government office, or someone getting arrested unjustly, or complain that people at the dam construction site are too violent.`
`Since it's idle chatter, the topics are slightly emotional, and because of that, there was a good deal of badmouthing the Houjous.`
`"...Then she threw the circulation notes away!!`
` Can you believe that?!"`
`"That woman is crazy.`
` Just the other day, she got into a huge argument with Makino-san's grandmother at the trash pickup!"`
`"You know,`
` the husband is rude too!`
` He's so irrational!!"`
`"Ah, did you see him at the explanatory meeting?`
` That was bad, huh?`
` I can't believe they're still here.`
` I wish they'd just leave!!`
` He said something about money.`
` He has absolutely no shame!!!"`
`"No, no, no!!`
` If you talk about being irrational, his wife is the same or even worse!!!`
` Wahahahahahaha!!"`
`"It must be hereditary!!`
` I see their daughter shopping quite often, so I used to say hello to her, but she never replied. Can you believe that?`
` So I got tired of it and I don't say anything to her anymore."`
`"Hey, their son always looks sooooo depressed, doesn't he?`
` Hahahahahaha!"`
`By now, the Houjou family has become the enemy of the whole village.`
` Badmouthing the Houjou family was the greatest shared topic that anyone could easily contribute to.`
`...If he had known how powerful the Three Families were, especially the Sonozaki family...`
`And if he had known Oryou-san's character, he wouldn't have said the things he did.`
`The Houjou couple are residents here.`
`Though they were never very enthusiastic about the council activities, they should've known what kind of person Oryou-san is.`
`He could have imagined just what would happen to him if he talked to her that way.`
`Yet, he let his anger take over and voiced his unpleasant feelings.`
`So most people think the Houjou family brought their isolation upon themselves.`
`If they wanted to negotiate with the government regarding the move, they should have done so privately.`
`Yet he was foolish enough to express himself at a public gathering like that.`
`So not too many sympathize with the Houjou family.`
`Ever since the big fight at the explanatory meeting, the Sonozaki family has looked at the Houjou family as their enemy, and started to go after them.`
`...That caused the other pro-dam families to go quiet, fearing they'd be made into scapegoats too, and those who wanted to leave were bitterly forced to give up.`
`...Even those people started criticizing the Houjou couple, saying they could've gotten their compensation to leave if the two hadn't picked that reckless fight.`
`Both the anti-dam and pro-dam people hate the Houjous now, and the family has become even more isolated.`
`Moreover, the Houjous are both very aggressive. They should have stayed quiet at least until things settled down, but they didn't. `
`That alienated the handful of people who took pity on them as well, so now nobody even says anything to them.`
`All of that was immediately obvious by listening to the foul talk here and there at the gathering place.`
`Rika always helps out by putting the tea cups away, so I'm sure she hears what they say as well.`
`One of the Houjou family members they're bad-mouthing is Rika's friend, Satoko-chan.`
`It hurts to think about what Rika feels while hearing that.`
`As priest of the Furude Shrine, should I let this continue?`
`Oyashiro-sama is a god who makes peace between enemies.`
`When the humans and demons fought, Oyashiro-sama descended from heaven and mediated between both sides.`
`As the caretaker of this shrine, I must do something before it goes too far.`
`I'm sitting next to Oryou-san, who is spitefully disparaging the Houjou family.`
`"So that ass was talking shit to me!!`
` Who the hell cares!!`
` He'll be cursed by Oyashiro-sama, that's for sure!!"`
`The elderly people cheer her on as they listen to her speak.`
`......If I barge in now,`
` I have a feeling it won't be a peaceful conversation.`
`But I have to make up my mind.`
`As the priest of the Furude Shrine.`
`Also for the sake of Rika's friend, Satoko-chan.`
`"...Oryou-san,`
` don't you think you've said enough by now?"`
`"Huh?`
` What the hell are you trying to tell me?"`
`"Well,`
` I'm sure Houjou-san really didn't mean what he said.`
` Isn't it a bit much for this kind of treatment to go on for so long...?"`
`"SHUT UP!!!`
` You heard what he said, didn't you?`
` Weren't you pissed? He pissed me off!!`
` Shit, shit!!!"`
`Oryou-san is the head of the Sonozaki family.`
`The heir to the demons.`
` She never forgives anyone who stands against her.`
`So there's no way she would even listen to what I'm trying to say.`
`Oryou-san and the others became furious and refused to listen to me.`
`I also mentioned that the dam construction plan will be cancelled soon, so they should calm down already.`
`I said that because the staff at the Irie Clinic told me that the government is putting some kind of pressure on the Ministry of Construction.`
`But thinking that I'm being an opportunist,`
`soon criticism of me began to circulate the room.`
`...After that, I realize that I've become branded as a fence-sitter.`
`...If the demons are willing to listen, then there's a chance to make peace.`
`But how can I make peace with people who refuse to listen?`
`I destroyed their mood... so I just have to give up and shut my mouth.`
`Then I felt a little hand on my back.`
`"Rika...`
` It's getting late, why don't you go home?"`
`"......No matter how hard we try, we can't reach them."`
`Rika looked into the distance while she spoke.`
`"...The evil of this corrupted village is probably beyond the means of those of us living in that muck...`
` But... I won't lose hope.`
` ...Surely... someone who will destroy this stagnation will arrive. `
`Very soon... I know..."`
`Her eyes shone as if seeing a future that only the maiden of the Furude Shrine could see.`
