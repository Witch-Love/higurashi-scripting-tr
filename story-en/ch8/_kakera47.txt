`This is the piece of Shion Sonozaki, who goes mad after being taken in by Rule X.`
`With no room for sympathy, this is such a painful piece that one can only have pity.`
`It distinctly identifies the keyhole of the padlock called Rule Z.`
`Keiichi Maebara becomes a key himself to pry open this padlock.`
`And as Mion Sonozaki wished for, he becomes a wind that clears out the stagnant air filling the village.`
`This piece also teaches us an important lesson.`
`Shion Sonozaki learns through this piece, and then becomes a strong ally for Satoko Houjou.`
`In that way, maybe Satoko Houjou is a piece that represents the padlock for Rule Z.`
`Unless she is saved, Rule Z can't be defeated.`
`And when she is saved, that means Rule Z is defeated.`
`This piece indicates only that.`
`That's the only thing Shion Sonozaki learned by gambling her life.`
`But now, I think that it's very important.`
`Every time I see Satoko and Shion argue about pumpkins, I think about that.`
