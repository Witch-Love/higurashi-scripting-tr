`We were prepared to respond quickly this year.`
`That was why we were able to start the investigation immediately by securing the crime scene.`
`The victim is the wife of the younger brother of the Houjou couple.`
`So she's an extremely suitable target for the fourth year's curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`She has a horrible reputation among the locals.`
`After the incident, everyone said she deserved to be cursed.`
`...I have a general idea of who the culprit must be.`
`It's probably... Satoshi Houjou.`
` That innocent-looking kid.`
`There's even a motive.`
`The deceased abused his sister relentlessly.`
`So this would be in revenge for that.`
`Also, when he attended the inspection of the crime scene, he was rather frantic, yet also far too composed, as if he was totally unrelated to the incident. `
`My intuition from many years of police work tells me that eight or nine times out of ten, someone who acts like that is the perp.`
`I have no concrete proof, but if I question him and shake him up a bit, I have a feeling he'll confess.`
`"For the victim to be so beaten up, the culprit must have some blood on him as well.`
` If we can find that, then we'll have proof."`
`"Unless he's a complete fool, I'm sure he's already gotten rid of it by now.`
` If we can find any in the place he says he disposed it in after he fesses up, then we can convince the prosecutor too."`
`This was pretty insignificant as a standalone case.`
`...A confession from Satoshi Houjou would end it.`
`Everyone except me must believe that.`
`But if I look at it as a part of the series of mysterious deaths, it won't be so easy.`
`Either the Three Families of the village,`
` or the Sonozaki family alone, is directly involved in this.`
`If they are the ones pulling the strings, they must have instigated Satoshi Houjou into committing this crime.`
`......If so, Satoshi Houjou is someone who knows way too much about them.`
`The Sonozaki family's actions must remain hidden.`
`If he could connect them to the crime, would they let him run around freely?`
`Satoshi Houjou is a loving brother who cares very much for his sister, and they set him up to kill his aunt as the fourth year's curse.`
`After that... they will eliminate the one person who can connect them to the crime.`
`......Satoshi Houjou is not just a simple criminal.`
` He was set up.`
`And after that, my suspicions were confirmed...`
` For he abruptly vanished.`
`He disappeared in such a puzzling way.`
`He didn't run because he was afraid that his crime had come to light.`
`......Another culprit came into the picture.`
`He was already arrested for a different crime and furthermore, he died while in prison.`
`He confessed to information only the culprit himself would have known.`
`Therefore, he must be the culprit.`
`But as he's already dead, the investigation was closed.`
`Then Satoshi Houjou disappeared a few days after the festival.`
`......It's obvious someone doesn't want Satoshi Houjou to be connected to this incident.`
`My boss put pressure on me to close the investigation and to file Satoshi Houjou's disappearance as a separate incident.`
` He even handed the case over to a different section.`
`The way this case is closing so rapidly,`
` greatly resembles the same trick used two years ago with the Houjou couple's accident.`
`......There's no doubt it's the work of someone who can put pressure on the police.`
`As it happens... the Sonozaki family is the only one who can actually exact influence on the police department here in the Hinamizawa area.`
`They may think their trails are covered, but this points towards them more clearly than anything.`
`According to my informant, Oryou Sonozaki mentioned the fourth year's curse at the family meeting and hinted that she was the one behind it all.`
`...Hinting isn't strong enough evidence, but there is no mistaking that Oryou Sonozaki is the one pulling the strings.`
`I know they're the ones who did in the old man.`
` But I just can't grab them!!`
`The principal offender is still on the loose, but I'm sure he's being sheltered somewhere by the Sonozaki family.`
`...I have to locate him, and find that missing right arm!`
`I'll return the arm to his grave, and make the principal offender and the masterminds both bow down before it.`
`...However, just like how Satoshi Houjou disappeared, it's possible the principal offender has already been eliminated.`
`I bet he's already been killed and buried somewhere nobody can find.`
` If that's the case, then that's fine. `
`......I'll make the old hag who ordered someone to kill the old man slam her forehead on the ground before his grave.`
` ...This, I swear...!!`
`After the fourth year's curse, people are already saying something will happen again next year.`
`Even with all my preparations, I couldn't prevent the incident from happening this time.`
`It's too late if something happens.`
`I must keep my eyes on the core of the village before something takes place.`
`There's a reason why I have to get to the bottom of this by next year.`
`Because... I'm retiring.`
`My mother has been wanting to go back to her hometown in Hokkaido, and for a long time, she's been asking me to move there when I retire.`
`I feel that's the least I can do for her, so I agreed to move to Hokkaido when I retire.`
`...So next year is my last chance to avenge the old man's death.`
`It happened four years in a row.`
` So more than likely, there will be a fifth curse too.`
`As a result of the series of mysterious deaths, the village has been tightly knit together since the dam protests.`
`They were told that betrayers will be punished in the name of the curse.`
`...To the masterminds, that's enough reason to continue with the series of mysterious deaths.`
`According to rumors, this year's victim, the aunt, was cursed because she didn't participate in the Watanagashi festival.`
`So there are villagers who believe that if they don't participate in next year's Watanagashi, they'll be cursed...`
` It'll be a huge festival next year for sure. `
`Something will happen.`
`The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa,`
` also known as the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`...I will avenge the old man.`
` I definitely, definitely will...`
