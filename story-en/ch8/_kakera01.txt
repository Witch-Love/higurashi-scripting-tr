`Plans for Satoko-chan's dissection are moving right along.`
`I don't want Satoshi-kun to be sad.`
`I feel pity for Satoko-chan and her harsh circumstances.`
`I'm still struggling with how much I have to sacrifice for the sake of research.`
`".......Irie?"`
`"Eh?`
` Ah, sorry.`
` What is it, Rika-chan?"`
`"......One of my friends has been in the clinic for a long time. Do you think she has Hinamizawa Syndrome?"`
`"Who told you that?"`
`"......No one, I just thought about it.`
` So what do you think, Irie?`
` Does Satoko have Hinamizawa Syndrome?"`
`Rika-chan is on our side.`
`There's nothing I have to hide from her.`
`Actually, I probably shouldn't keep anything from her.`
`"......Yes.`
` The problems with her parents, and then their sudden deaths...`
` It was all too much for her to bear.`
` ...Maybe that was what triggered it."`
`"What did the test results say?"`
`"L5.`
` She seems perfectly fine on the surface, but her emotions are extremely unstable.`
` Since the other day, she's even been refusing to meet with Satoshi-kun."`
`"......Satoshi told me.`
` He's worried that it's taking a very long time for Satoko to get better.`
` ...Irie,`
` what will happen to Satoko?"`
`"..............."`
`Satoko-chan is Rika-chan's best friend.`
`How can I tell her that we're planning to dissect Satoko-chan...?`
`However, even if I don't say anything, she already knows that Satoko-chan's situation is extremely poor.`
`"......Didn't you find out a lot of things when you examined me?"`
`"Sure, of course...`
` We're even testing medicine which might be able to control the symptoms."`
`"......Can't you give that medicine to Satoko?"`
`"I thought about it...`
` but it's too dangerous.`
` We're still in the trial stages, and trying to gather more data.`
` We can't use it on someone who's in a delicate situation like Satoko-chan."`
`"......Then,`
` if you won't try that medicine, what will happen to Satoko?"`
`She spoke as if aware of our plans for Satoko-chan.`
`...No, she must actually know.`
`I've told her about most of my research.`
`...She's more mature than she looks, so it'd be easy for her to figure out.`
`"......If there's even a 1% chance of Satoko getting better, then I think we should take that chance."`
`"It's extremely risky.`
` ...Worst case, she could immediately display terminal symptoms and hallucinate, or potentially lose her consciousness and spend the rest of her life just staring blankly at a wall. `
`...Either one would be too cruel a fate for her."`
`"......So are you saying it's better to have her die in her sleep?"`
`"............"`
`"......Irie.`
` Just like Takano says, there are no guarantees in medicine.`
` But if we don't do anything, Satoko will die for sure.`
` I think it's clear what we should do."`
`"......That's true.`
` You're right."`
`But I know too well.`
`C103, the medicine that's being tested, may not even be something that can be used.`
`It may not even have a 1% chance of success.`
`Worse, I can't even imagine what kind of tragic end she'd meet if her body rejects the medicine.`
`That's why......`
` ...I'm tempted to believe it would be far more mericiful to feed her favorite food,`
` let her gently fall asleep, and after that, dissect her while she dreams.`
`...I don't want to admit it, but Takano-san is right.`
`I'm being indecisive and showing a lack of resolve.`
`...How effective could the medicine made by someone like that really be?`
`...So, because it was medicine I created myself... I couldn't even believe there might be a 0.1% chance of success.`
`"......I think we can believe in it."`
`She spoke as if she read my mind.`
`Surprised, I raised my head up to look at her... and found her giving me a reassuring look I never would've imagined someone her age capable of.`
`"......People's lives depend on your job.`
` It's almost absurd that a human being can control life and death like that.`
` I can't even imagine the pressure."`
`Her voice hasn't changed, but I feel like Rika-chan is admonishing me.`
`Almost as if she knows what it's like to be responsible for human lives.`
`"...Guilt and regret are a part of that.`
` That's why you can't use the medicine on Satoko.`
` Isn't that right?"`
`"........."`
`Takano-san said the same thing when she criticized me earlier.`
` I'm being criticized again.`
`"But...`
` that's why I can trust you with Satoko."`
`"What...?"`
`"Human lives are precious.`
` You understand that very well, and that's why you do what you do.`
` ......Without knowing that, how could you heal people?`
`Do you think I'd trust medicine created by Takano, who thinks humans are just her guinea pigs?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`"...Ha... hahahahaha..."`
`I shouldn't have laughed, but I couldn't help it......`
`...I felt like I should laugh.`
`"If both you and Takano each produced different medicine,`
` I think yours would be the one to cure her.`
` Because your medicine came from your heart...`
` Your will to heal people is what cures them."`
`"...You're absolutely right.`
` ...I can't believe you're admonishing me about medicine."`
`"I let you use my body for Satoko.`
` Everything you took out from me is for her.`
` If you created that medicine with the knowledge of how precious human lives are,`
` then of course it'll work on Satoko."`
`...Do shrine maidens take confessions?`
`If they do, she's doing a great job being a shrine maiden at this age.`
`"......This will be`
` a gamble.`
` ...The question is whether Satoko-chan will accept it..."`
`"We don't need to tell her.`
` Learning of the Hinamizawa Syndrome will only dredge up the deep scar on her heart again."`
`What did she mean by those words?`
`When I realized it later, I was surprised by how thoughtful and perceptive she was.`
`".........Let's stop plans for the dissection.`
` We're going to give Satoko Houjou C103...`
` I'll do my best to increase the chance by even 1%."`
`"......Don't worry, Irie.`
` It'll work."`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` You shouldn't be so optimistic."`
`"...I know it'll work.`
` It's already decided.`
`That's... a very reassuring prophecy from the Furude Shrine's shrine maiden.`
`......Go for it,`
` yay`
