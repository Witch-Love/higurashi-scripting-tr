`"...I see.`
` No, you don't need to do that.`
` You're a promising member of the Hinamizawa Fighters.`
` We'll save your spot.`
` So you can come back anytime, okay?"`
`"Ahh... I don't know about that though...`
` I have no idea when I can come back, so I thought I should resign at least for now..."`
`Satoshi-kun says he wants to quit the Hinamizawa Fighters.`
`I know very well of Satoshi-kun and Satoko-chan's situation,`
` so I was expecting that he might say this.`
`The relationship between Satoko-chan and her aunt has gotten worse, to the point that it can be considered abuse.`
`When someone from the child consultation center came, of course her aunt behaved herself.`
` ...Then immediately after, her harassment turned even more vicious.`
`According to the neighbors, the aunt's scolding and Satoko-chan's crying can be heard nightly, and sometimes it goes on past midnight.`
`Satoko-chan's weekly physical check up results are slowly growing worse,`
` and we're trying to keep her stable by increasing her medication. `
`But... unless her relationship with her aunt improves, she's sure to go terminal, and sink into madness.`
`...Although, she isn't the type to become deranged, even at the terminal stage.`
`She's the type who holds everything in, harboring her insanity inside.`
`Just like she pushed her parents off the cliff two years ago, Satoko-chan may kill her aunt.`
`Thanks to the Mountain Dogs, the incident was resolved as an accident and Ooishi stepped aside, although he is still suspicious.`
`If something like that happens again around Satoko-chan...`
` he's sure to investigate her mercilessly.`
`...I can't do anything more about Satoko-chan's environment changing for worse.`
`So I'm not surprised to hear that Satoshi-kun wants to quit the baseball team so he can be with his sister more.`
`"Actually, I'm starting a part-time job.`
` That's why I can't come to practice..."`
`"...A part-time`
` job?`
` Is there something you want to buy?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It's almost Satoko's birthday.`
` There's a teddy bear Satoko has been looking at, and I want to get it for her."`
`That's right.`
`I remember the birth date on her insurance card.`
`I think it's June 24th.`
` Right after the Watanagashi festival.`
`"I see...`
` ...You're such a good brother.`
` I'm sure Satoko-chan will be thrilled!"`
`"......I hope so."`
`I can tell Satoshi-kun is also stressed out.`
`To him, seeing Satoko-chan being harassed is the same thing as being harassed himself.`
`His stress can be released through moderate exercise, such as with sports, and also with plenty of rest.`
`If Satoko-chan is being yelled at nightly, then it's easy to figure out that Satoshi-kun isn't getting enough sleep either.`
`I don't know what kind of job he's starting, but I don't think he will be able to vent his stress on it.`
`In fact, I don't like the idea of Satoshi-kun taking a part-time job, because he's already so worn out in every way.`
`I asked him if he wanted me to help him pay for the present, but of course, he declined the offer.`
`It's a present from him, so he wants to earn the money himself.`
`He's taking this part-time job only to earn enough money to buy Satoko-chan's present, so it'll be a temporary thing.`
`If it's for a short period of time, maybe it won't be that bad.`
`While I want to stop him from working because I don't want him to get even more stressed,`
` since he says Satoko-chan's birthday is near, I don't think I can stop him.`
`Satoshi-kun is determined.`
`If I say any more, I may lose his trust.`
`So I'll have to accept his leave of absence.`
`"...Oh, Coach.`
` ...Can I maybe borrow a bat?"`
`I completely misunderstood his words.`
`Later I found out he carried around that bat to protect himself...`
` and realized that, even then, he was already showing some dangerous symptoms.`
`He believed there would be a fourth mysterious death this year`
` and that he would be the victim.`
`He became obsessed with the idea that someone was after his life.`
`That is a symptom of Hinamizawa Syndrome's terminal stage.`
`But although I was involved so deeply with the syndrome, I was careless...`
`"A bat?`
` What do you need a bat for?"`
`Satoshi-kun had his own bat.`
`So he should have asked if he could take it home, but instead, he asked if he could borrow it.`
`When I think about it now, he said it that way to lighten his guilty conscience. But how could I have known then?`
`"Well...`
` although I can't come to practice...`
` I think I'll have a little time to practice swinging on my own."`
`"That's great!`
` Sure, please take it with you.`
` But make sure you do it in an open space, okay?`
` If it won't bother your neighbors, it's good practice to hit a hanging tire."`
`Swinging a bat can release stress.`
`So letting him take his bat home will help.`
` That's what I thought.`
`But...... that was a huge mistake.`
`I realized it only when things were already past the point of no return.`
