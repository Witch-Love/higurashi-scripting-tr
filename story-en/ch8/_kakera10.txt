`When researching Hinamizawa Syndrome, there is something very important that needs to be discussed first.`
`If something happens to the queen carrier, the village will collapse.`
`In his article, my grandfather called it the most dangerous situation.`
`According to my grandfather, if the queen carrier dies,`
` all the infected persons will go terminal within 48 hours.`
`This may sound unbelievable at first, but research on the collapse of past local religions and group suicides around the world should indicate that there's some truth to it.`
`Among all the mysterious incidents around the world, there are some that were caused by parasites controlling entire communities, very similar to Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`Grandfather picked a few cases that are very similar to the syndrome and investigated them.`
`As a result, he confirmed multiple cases of entire communities losing their minds after the death of a religious leader or founder, and finally annihilating themselves.`
`He stated that, on average, it happened within 48 hours.`
`It's clear that infected people are affected by the queen carrier, and the condition of the queen carrier is, in fact, affecting the entire village.`
`Our statistics already proved that on weeks Rika felt sick and visited the clinic, we saw an exceptionally high number of visitors.`
`Rika being sick with a simple cold had a massive impact.`
` If something particularly bad happened to her, we'd be facing a serious situation within 48 hours.`
`That's why the Irie Institute has to protect Rika Furude, the queen carrier. It's the most important mission of the Hinamizawa Syndrome research project.`
`She's already agreed to help us in our research, but we have to be very careful not to put her in any danger.`
` Also, we have to protect her from anyone who would try to harm her. `
`Her life is equal to the lives of two thousand villagers.`
`But...`
` what if something happens to her by accident?`
`The Irie Institute must prepare for that situation.`
`That's why I worked on the draft of an emergency manual when the Irie Institute was first established.`
`It's a precaution in case the queen carrier dies, or if infected people show acute symptoms due to the death of the queen carrier.`
`This is an emergency procedure which must be followed within 48 hours of the mass occurrence of the acute symptoms.`
`......The final measure is to prevent the damage from spreading to nearby areas.`
`The plan uses gas, making it look like a natural disaster.`
`My client, the Alphabet Project, took the responsibility of working out the details of the plan.`
`They are used to dealing with things like nuclear and biological weapons, so they ended up being such a big help.`
`There's no way I could have come up with a plan on my own to execute two thousand villagers.`
`Through a dummy company, the Ground SDF has secured a closed quarry in the Yagouchi region, upstream of Hinamizawa.`
`It's to be the secret storage base for the equipment we'd use in that operation.`
`Equipment that sprays deadly gas that kills people as if they were falling asleep is stored here. In the case of an emergency, a special unit of the Ground SDF is to use this equipment to destroy the village.`
`However, preparing for the execution of the villagers itself is politically dangerous.`
`So, if I'm going to insist on them getting the equipment ready, I have to make them understand how dangerous Hinamizawa Syndrome is, and also how urgent the need is to have a contingency plan.`
`I have to prove the need for the plan by showing them enough data.`
`So the files my grandfather kept intact come in quite handy.`
`When the clients read my grandfather's articles about the syndrome,`
` they were surprised to see how catastrophic things could be in the worst-case scenario.`
`"......In other words, if something happens to this girl, the queen carrier, all two thousand of the villagers will become deranged. Is that what you're saying?"`
`"Yes.`
` There have been several cases similar to Hinamizawa Syndrome where group suicides took place. `
`In the case of the syndrome, we can easily expect extreme defensive behavior which results from deep paranoia. The result may affect all two thousand plus carriers. `
`From there on, we may face abnormal situations involving lawless violence and bizarre religious despondence. `
`We must be ready to face such a situation by having a contingency plan, otherwise we'll draw attention from the rest of the world.`
` We have to remember that we only have 48 hours to respond once it happens."`
`"...Are you saying that if it happens there's nothing anyone can do?"`
`"Can't you treat everyone within 48 hours?"`
`"That'll be impossible.`
` We don't even have a cure, and the research center isn't capable of taking in all the villagers."`
`"...How frightening to realize such a disease actually exists.`
` The world is full of mysteries."`
`"Constant vigilance against worst-case scenarios supports our national defense, and is one of the ideas behind the Alphabet Project.`
` Besides, our goal is not to use the plan, but it's vital to be prepared."`
`"Indeed.`
` Precisely as you say.`
` I'd still like to look into strengthening the rules of approval authority behind applying the plan, but I understand the necessity to prepare our response for a worst-case scenario."`
`"Let's have the urban suppression research team run a simulation of the Hinamizawa suppression operation in the region.`
` I think we should get it going as soon as possible."`
`"It's possible that the queen carrier girl may be hit by a car and be killed at any moment.`
` Thank you, Major Takano.`
` We have further questions, so you can sit down."`
`Thanks to a push from one of my backers, things were decided without too much of a problem.`
`It took me almost all day to explain it to them, but it only took a short time to come to a decision.`
`Nobody criticized, ridiculed, or tried to reject my grandfather's articles out of hand.`
`...In the files they're all reading today...`
` ...are the very same, shameful articles those haughty authorities left their footprints on as they trampled them and my grandfather's heart.`
`But they aren't ridiculing the articles.`
` They are reading what was once rejected.`
`It's nothing big, at a glance, but in this moment, my grandfather's research is being recognized for the first time.`
`My heart is filled with satisfaction to see people discussing amongst each other while pointing to my grandfather's files and raising them as proof.`
`...I've worked so hard for this day.`
`Grandpa in Heaven... can you see this?`
