`Welcome!`
`Welcome to the world of Higurashi Ch.8 - Matsuribayashi.`
`In this world, you will be able to recreate the story from Hanyuu's point of view.`
`Your objective is to create the June 1983 ideal to you.`
`You will need to collect many different Fragments to make that possible.`
`However, Takano's conviction is very strong.`
`To overturn it, you will need a lot of effort and a lot of Fragments.`
`I'll warn you right now... it'll be a slow and painful process.`
`Hanyuu went through it for over a hundred years, and she even had to stop and give in to fate.`
`Defeating Takano's conviction will not be easy. `
`The trial in this world will put you through as much pain as Hanyuu had to endure.`
`You may surrender, just like Hanyuu did, after being emotionally worn down by the constant repetition of the worlds woven by countless Fragments.`
`When you feel like surrendering, `
`you can end this game at any time.`
`But if you do, the worlds revolving around your friends' fate will be limited to Onikakushi through Minagoroshi.`
`By forgetting about this world and uninstalling this product, you will finally accept death.`
` Just like Rika did.`
`Your ideal June 1983 can be created by putting together fifty Fragments that are scattered all over this world.`
`To connect these Fragments together, you will need the right ones.`
`There are fifty of them, which may be dizzying.`
`However, this world isn't that merciless.`
`To ease your pain, there'll be a little help for you.`
`When you choose the wrong pieces...`
`Your only ally here will give you a sign that it's not yet time to put those Fragments together.`
`As long as the sign remains, you won't be able to connect them.`
`You might as well go look for different ones.`
`After you put other Fragments together, you might be able to connect the ones you couldn't put together earlier.`
`When that happens, she'll let you know.`
`Let's put those Fragments together.`
` Then you'll be able to join the other ones, too.`
`When you connect all fifty, they'll become one big Fragment.`
` There you'll find your ideal June 1983.`
`That's when the long awaited Matsuribayashi will begin.`
`Before you peek at each Fragment, why don't you line up all fifty of them first?`
`Most of them require other Fragments, so there are only a few you can actually look at.`
`Let's try to find those first.`
`To see the conditions for connecting Fragments, just point the cursor at them.`
`Before anything else, let's find the ones you can look at without any conditions.`
`This will be an extremely long and difficult trial.`
`Let me tell you again, Hanyuu challenged this for over a hundred years and gave up on it.`
`If you believe in miracles in the same way your friends do...`
`Even if you don't live in the world where they live, if you believe in them...`
`Welcome.`
`Welcome to the world of Higurashi Ch.8 - Matsuribayashi.`
`In this world, you'll be tested to see if you believe in the world that Rika and the others believed in.`
`A miracle only happens when everyone combines their strength.`
`The June 1983 created by Takano is nearly indomitable.`
`She's gathered many people whose powers are beyond the average person to her side, her backers being at the center of national authority.`
`Even if a hundred dice all rolled ones, there wouldn't even be a chance to defeat her.`
`In other words, a miracle is the only way forward.`
`A miracle happens only when everyone combines their strength.`
`And you are one of them.`
`Are you ready?`
`I'm more than ready.`
` The key to a long journey is not to pressure yourself too hard.`
` Well, let's take it at a light pace.`
` I'll work while drinking my usual wine.`
`Shall we begin?`
`We have all the time in this world.`
