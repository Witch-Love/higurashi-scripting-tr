`My name is Satoko Houjou.`
`But "Houjou" is my current father's family name.`
`I was also Satoko Hatake, Satoko Yoshizawa, and also Satoko Matsuura, because of my previous fathers.`
`I'm still not used to being called "Houjou-san".`
`If someone calls me Satoko, then I know that person is talking to me.`
`Because Satoko is the name I've been using since I was born.`
`I don't understand why my mother keeps getting married and divorced.`
`If she's going to get a divorce, why does she get married?`
`If she's married, why does she get a divorce?`
`I've asked her before, but depending on the situation, her answers were different.`
`When I asked her when she was married, she got angry.`
`When I asked her after she got divorced, she cried.`
`I don't understand the meaning of marriage.`
`So I have no interest in drawing pictures of a bride in a wedding dress.`
`I don't think I'll ever get married.`
`I don't want to keep changing my child's last name.`
`My teacher once asked if I liked my mother.`
` I think it was when I was in kindergarten in Okinomiya.`
`That was a very difficult question.`
`Because sometimes I loved her very much and sometimes I hated her very much. I couldn't decide.`
`When my mother was nice, she smiled all the time.`
` She made us happy.`
`She thanked me for being her daughter.`
`When my mother wasn't nice, she frowned all the time.`
` She treated my brother and me very poorly.`
`She told me I should have never been born.`
`My teacher asked me if I liked my father.`
`That was a very easy question.`
`Because I always hated him very much. No matter who he was.`
`The new fathers always treated me nicely at first. As if I was their real daughter.`
`They always told me I could think of them as my real father.`
`But they couldn't be my real father.`
` Besides, I didn't even know my real father's face.`
` How could I call them my father? I couldn't.`
` That was disgusting.`
`Right before divorce, my fathers always became very irritated with me.`
` They treated me like a cockroach.`
`They told me they didn't have money to feed me, they threw things at me, and they locked me out on the veranda.`
`I was told I could forget about them because that was all in the past.`
` I think that was a different teacher from a different school.`
`Maybe that's true.`
`Because ever since Houjou became my father, my mother has been smiling.`
`I haven't seen them get into a fight as I have seen happen just before a divorce.`
` They have little arguments here and there, but those don't lead to a divorce, and they always make up.`
`But I'm sure they'll get a divorce sooner or later.`
`Then it'll be the same old stuff with the family court, divorce settlements, a night flight, and child support.`
`So who knows how long this Houjou will be my father? That's why I don't even feel like calling him that.`
`He also treated me well at first.`
`But when I didn't call him father even after he asked me repeatedly, he became irritated.`
`They'll get a divorce soon.`
` When my father gets into this mood, a divorce is on the way.`
`After a divorce, it's my mother's turn to be irritated with me.`
`Then she'll tell me she shouldn't have had me or she can't be happy because of me.`
`Why is my existence causing problems for my mother?`
`I asked my brother and he told me.`
`If you have children, it's not easy to find someone to get married with.`
`To my mother, remarriage is a very important job, so I can understand having children around will cause problems.`
`I think I finally understand the reason why I'm a nuisance to her.`
`I asked my brother something else.`
`Why are children hated by new fathers?`
`Well, that's simple.`
` That's because family members all have different roles.`
`A mother's job is to love her children.`
`A father's job is to love the mother.`
`That means I'm a nuisance to both my mother and my father.`
`My brother is more mature than me, so they don't look down on him as a nuisance.`
`But maybe I am... no, I am definitely a nuisance.`
`So now I know.`
`Both my mother and father want me dead.`
`But if they kill me, they'll be caught.`
`But that doesn't mean they won't kill me.`
`If I were to look down the cliff,`
` and if no one was around,`
` my mother and father would push me off for sure.`
`My father has become abnormally nice to me recently.`
`He started to act that way ever since I made the fake call.`
`I know for sure that it's just part of a plot to kill me.`
`So I won't let them trick me.`
`I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...`
`Lately when I listen very carefully, I can hear a voice apologizing.`
`The voice sounds similar to mine. Her mother must be telling her that she shouldn't have been born.`
`...I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry...`
`But I won't apologize like that.`
`I'll live.`
` I am going to strike back.`
` I'll kill before I get killed.`
`...I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry...`
