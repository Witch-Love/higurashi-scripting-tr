`I thought the rain would cool down my boiling heart.`
` But as my body got cold, I started to feel miserable.`
`My bare feet were all swollen, and the throbbing pain I felt made them seem twice their normal size.`
`The gravel road continued forever.`
`I didn't even know what direction I was headed in anymore.`
`I could no longer hear my pursuer.`
`I had probably lost him by running through the woods like mad.`
`My body was covered in scratches.`
`I finally started to feel the pain from that.`
`I felt both cold and hungry.`
`There was no place nearby to take shelter from the rain.`
`I was just on a little path in the woods.`
`My worst fear was that I could end up heading back towards the orphanage`
` after bolting and losing my sense of direction.`
`I had crushed that man's finger.`
`I didn't think I bit it off, but I was sure it would leave a scar.`
`Taking that into consideration, it was very clear to me what kind of torture awaited me back at the orphanage.`
`Therefore, I'd have to reach The House of Love and Mercy.`
`If only it had been daytime. Then I could easily have found the right way to go.`
`However, with this rain, there was nothing I could do.`
`But I couldn't stop.`
`I had to keep walking until I reached something.`
`I wondered if Eriko and the others had escaped safely.`
`I didn't know how many people came after us, but at least one came after me.`
`In other words, it meant they had a better chance.`
`Did they reach The House of Love and Mercy?`
`Were they drying themselves with soft towels?`
`And if they still remembered me, would they save a towel for me too?`
`I felt so cold.`
`I wanted to find shelter and sit down.`
`But there was nothing of the sort.`
`I saw a tree that looked like I could take shelter under it, but the branches and leaves were dripping with water.`
`It was then that I realized that the sky was gradually getting darker.`
`Would this day end in rain?`
`There were no street lights where I was.`
`Soon enough it would be totally dark.`
`Then I wouldn't be able to walk any further.`
`I just wanted to sit down, even if it was raining.`
`But if I did sit down, I probably wouldn't be able to stand up again.`
` So I endured.`
`If I hadn't escaped with Eriko and the others, I wouldn't have had to go through such misery.`
`But compared to what I had to go through at the orphanage, this was nothing.`
`Thinking about that was the only way to make myself move.`
`But, when I thought about that...`
`It's true that this freezing cold rain was far better than my life at the orphanage.`
`But that was only when compared to the life at the orphanage.`
`Was it better than the normal lives of normal kids my age?`
`I didn't even need to think about that.`
`When my parents were alive, although we weren't rich, we led a normal life.`
`The gentle smiles and forgivable selfishness.`
`The sound of my mother cooking breakfast in the morning, the sound of a newspaper being folded...`
` precious memories like that.`
`I didn't need anything else.`
`I had plenty of friends. I had fun at school.`
`I didn't like my teacher, but I liked studying.`
` I had everything I needed.`
` That was enough for me.`
`I never complained.`
`I never did anything bad.`
`So why was this happening to me?`
`Everything went downhill after that train accident.`
`The die of fate kept rolling a one.`
`The die never showed its good side to me.`
`If the accident was my fault, then I could have accepted it.`
`But it wasn't.`
` I wasn't even there.`
`I waited for my parents at home.`
`I liked going to the mall with them.`
`We always had a meal at the restaurant in the mall.`
`I always told them to let me know if they were going to the mall.`
`But on that day, they went without me while I went to my friend's house to play.`
`My friend wasn't in, so I went back home.`
` I didn't see anyone at home and found a note that said they were going to the mall.`
`I regretted going to my friend's house. I waited at home.`
`They didn't come home. They were still gone by dinner time.`
`I was getting hungry, and got angry with my parents for leaving me.`
`I thought they were having dinner at the mall restaurant without me.`
`If I hadn't gone to my friend's house, I would be eating dinner at the restaurant too.`
`I loved the little flags that came with the kids' meals.`
`I was collecting those flags...`
`Yes, I was.`
`I was trying to collect twenty of them, thinking that once I collected twenty, something wonderful would happen.`
`But I couldn't collect twenty of them.`
`I only needed one more...`
`If I had one more, maybe the accident wouldn't have happened.`
`A very sad memory of a flag from a kid's meal...`
`I kept waiting for my parents to come home from the mall.`
`I was hungry, so I started to eat some dried fish.`
`If I ate too much, my mother would find out, so I was careful not to gorge myself.`
`Then the phone rang.`
`I assumed it was from my parents.`
`I answered the phone in an angry manner.`
`But it wasn't them at all.`
`............`
`What happened to the house?`
`We had rented it, so maybe somebody else had already moved in.`
`What happened to my room?`
`What about my desk and all the flags that were in the right middle drawer?`
`If it wasn't my house anymore,`
` then where was I supposed to go?`
`Even if it remained my house, `
`my parents wouldn't be there to welcome me or protect me.`
`Just because I didn't have my parents to protect me, the whole world became so cruel.`
`How could anyone take me away from the house I was used to living in, just because my parents were gone?`
`Why didn't they just leave me alone?`
`They asked me many things.`
` They tried to confirm many things.`
`But how could I have understood any of the forms they gave me?`
`I was asked a yes or no question. I had no choice but to answer yes.`
`And before I knew it, I ended up at the orphanage.`
` It was beyond heartless.`
`I didn't do anything wrong.`
` I was just a little girl.`
`I had to sign so many papers...`
` but why this?`
`The warm and gentle world ended suddenly without advance notice.`
`And I was thrown into the cruel and merciless world alone.`
`Was this the real world?`
`Did I have any allies at all?`
`Just because my parents died and I didn't have any relatives, the world had become so sad.`
`When is the die going to come up with a six instead of a one to make up for the continuous series of the latter?`
`"......Ooh..."`
`Tears were pouring down my cheeks.`
`The salty taste further saddened and irritated me.`
` I couldn't do anything but cry...`
`But no matter how hard I cried or pitied myself...`
`The cold rain wouldn't warm my body`
` or save me.`
`I didn't even know where I was or in which direction I should go.`
`Eriko showed me the map to The House of Love and Mercy when we were planning our escape.`
`But we only learned the shortest route.`
`I was completely lost.`
`But strangely, after I finished crying,`
` I felt a groundless strength within myself.`
`I once learned that tears wash away particles in the eyes.`
` But there is a different purpose to them too.`
`Tears also wash away what's in the heart.`
`I clenched my fists and forced my feet to move. I headed in the direction that I believed to be correct on the gravel road.`
`The rain was still pouring.`
` And it was getting darker and darker.`
`I roared at the sky amidst the rain.`
`My sadness was turning into anger.`
`"You stupid God!`
` Why?!`
` What have I done to deserve this?`
` What did I do?`
` I didn't do anything!!`
` I was just living a normal life, that's all!!`
` So why this?! `
`My daddy told me there are good things and bad things in life, but neither lasts for long!`
` That means this misery won't last that long either, right?`
` I won't be all alone in this miserable place forever, right? `
`Isn't that right...?"`
`As I looked up, I felt the raindrops hit my face.`
`There is no God. I knew that in my heart.`
`But such disbelief wouldn't save me.`
`If I believed he was there, I should have been saved.`
` No, I needed him to BE there!`
`Was he going to answer me?`
`I heard thunder.`
`Then I realized`
` he was there.`
`He was there, and he was listening to me.`
`In his eyes, everyone was supposed to be equal.`
` And he was listening to me.`
`"I've gone through enough!`
` More than enough!!`
` If I was too happy before, then I could take this misery.`
` But I wasn't!!`
` I was living a normal life.`
` If you ask me if I was happy, then...`
` sure, I was. `
`But this is what I get in return? That's not fair at all!!!"`
`I heard thunder again.`
`He was listening.`
` I continued.`
`"If...`
` If this fate of mine was your mistake,`
` then let me be free!!`
` Please end my misery and let me be happy again!!`
` But if...`
` this is, in fact, my fate, and I'm supposed to live this way until the end, `
`then I don't want it!!!`
` Kill me!!`
` Kill me now with your lightning!!`
` Just finish me off now!!`
` Come on!!`
` Kill me ruthlessly, right here and now!!!"`
`I heard thunder again.`
`It was loud enough to make me shiver.`
`Normally, I would just hide in the house and wait until the thunder went away.`
`But on that day, I wasn't afraid.`
`"Come on!!`
` Kill me!!`
` Miyoko Tanashi is right here!!`
` Just like you killed my parents, take my life too!!!"`
`The heavens replied to my provocation.`
`The heavens took aim at me, a lowly human who dared sling constant, insolent insults at them.`
`That was my wish. I opened my arms.`
`He's God, so he wouldn't miss me.`
`However, I guess even God makes mistakes sometimes.`
` Although he's supposed to be fair, he had been unfair with me.`
`"Come on, kill me!!!`
` Take me to Heaven!! `
`But if you fail to kill me, then...`
` Try turning my destiny around!!!!"`
`".........Pitiful child..."`
`A flash from Heaven.`
`I thought I smelled something burning just before it hit.`
`The sheer force knocked me to the ground.`
`It was a strange experience.`
`It was something that had just happened,`
` but it already felt like it happened many years ago.`
`I had no idea how long I was down for.`
`I smelled something odd.`
`The bad stench woke me up.`
`When I looked, I saw that a huge tree behind me had been split open. Its leaves were smoldering.`
`I looked up, and saw sparks in the darkness.`
`I couldn't understand what just happened... I just stood there...`
`The thunderbolt had struck.`
`It didn't strike me. It struck the tree behind me.`
`I didn't get to die.`
`He was telling me to keep walking in the woods in the cold rain.`
`I won my bet with God.`
`I bet my life.`
` I bet my life against the lightning and thunder.`
`It could have killed me instantly.`
`But he missed,`
` so he had to fix my life.`
`I looked up at the sky, laughing and bragging that I was still alive.`
`I heard thunder again. It was acknowledging its loss.`
`Come on, God.`
` Save me.`
` I won the bet, so save me from this misery.`
`............`
`I stood there.`
`I waited for God to do something while the rain poured down on me.`
`But he didn't answer me again.`
`I couldn't hear the thunder anymore.`
`Again, I felt the warm tears pour down my cheeks.`
`What was I thinking?`
`If there was a God in Heaven, he wouldn't have let anything like this happen to me...`
`My miserable life was the proof of God's nonexistence.`
`The darkness was about to swallow me utterly.`
`Would I have to sleep out there?`
`God must have wanted me to die slowly in this cold rain instead of granting me an instant death by lightning.`
`I wished the sun would go away.`
` I wished the sun would never rise.`
` I wished that, as the woods had grown completely dark, my existence would be hidden by that darkness.`
` I wished that I could just disappear...`
`Had it been an eternity, or was it a matter of seconds?`
` I couldn't even tell time in such darkness.`
` It was then that I saw something.`
`It was`
` a light.`
`I noticed it only because the woods were so dark.`
`But was it really there?`
`Had it been there this whole time?`
`I felt like the light was inviting me towards it.`
`It was a fluorescent light.`
`I didn't normally like fluorescent lights, because I always thought they looked cold.`
`But I didn't feel coldness from that white light.`
`I made myself believe that the light was a guide sent by God.`
`I had to believe, otherwise I wouldn't be saved.`
`The light reflected in a puddle.`
`It wasn't a muddy puddle.`
`It was a puddle on asphalt.`
`I had made it out of the woods and was on a paved road.`
`The light was a street light.`
`Being on a paved road didn't really resolve anything.`
`It was just a country road.`
`It was a road that went through the woods, so there were no houses, no shops, and not even a single car going by.`
`There weren't too many street lights on the road, so it was still very dark.`
`My feet touched the asphalt.`
`It felt so different from the gravel I had been walking on earlier. It felt almost merciful.`
`My feet had grown used to walking on gravel,`
` but after feeling the softness of asphalt, I never wanted to go back to the former again.`
`I could only choose between heading left or heading right. `
`I was grateful to God for leading me to this asphalt road, but I wished that he had given me a little more guidance.`
`Such a little bit of luck couldn't make up for all the unhappiness I'd gone through.`
`...And that was when...`
` I sensed his guidance.`
`I saw another light in a distance.`
` It was only on the right side.`
`I headed towards it.`
`And when I got there, I understood what it was.`
`...I was amazed to find it there.`
` ...A telephone booth.`
`Who would actually make a call in the middle of nowhere?`
`A telephone booth in the countryside was rather unusual.`
`There were plenty of red public phones all over, but I had always thought telephone booths only existed in big cities.`
`It almost looked as though the telephone booth had been put there as punishment for doing something bad.`
`When I thought that, I felt bad for the lonely telephone booth... it reminded me of myself.`
`Even if I went inside the telephone booth, what could I even do in there anyway?`
`I already knew the answer to that question, but no matter what, I just had to get in there.`
`The door squeaked as I opened it. There were lots of moths and other bugs flittering around the light.`
`I usually hated bugs, but in that moment I felt like that they were my friends, sheltering from the rain like me.`
`There was no heater, `
`but it was still very warm inside of the booth.`
`It sheltered me from the cold rain.`
`Soon enough, I crumbled to the floor.`
`The warmth from the fluorescent light embraced me gently, and I felt like it was telling me that it was okay to cry.`
`But I had no more tears left, because I cried them all when the lightning struck.`
`Aching scratches covered my body.`
` My calves were in pain too.`
`Everything hurt everywhere and I didn't want to get up ever again.`
`I wished I could fall asleep.`
`But if I did that, the staff from the orphanage might find me.`
`The windows on the booth were high up, so if I sat down I wouldn't be visible from the outside.`
` But as it was the only shelter in these dark woods,`
`the staff would be sure to check it.`
` That was why I couldn't stay there for long.`
`(Telephone booths from back then weren't completely made of glass, so it was possible to hide inside one.)`
`My exhausted spirit understood that I had to move.`
` But I just couldn't make myself...`
`Maybe... I was experiencing some kind of vision...`
`I felt a strange calmness that I'd never experienced before.`
`I didn't feel that I was myself.`
` It was very strange.`
`I thought that maybe I was killed by that lightning.`
`I'd assumed I was still Miyoko Tanashi, but maybe I wasn't her at all.`
`I seriously considered those things.`
`Then I started to think that the telephone booth had something to do with it.`
`Because God led me there.`
`He couldn't have done so just because it was providing shelter from the rain. There had to be something else.`
`I wondered what it was.`
` Could there be something in the booth that could save me? `
`But what?`
`A telephone booth is used to make a phone call.`
` But I didn't have any money.`
`But then...`
` I noticed something that looked like copper.`
`...My heart skipped a beat.`
`The ten yen coin I saw wasn't there before.`
` Did I just miss it?`
`I didn't think so.`
`It must have just showed up.`
`In other words, this ten yen coin was guidance from God.`
` He was telling me to make a call with that coin.`
`But... who?`
`There was no telephone book.`
`In that case, `
`I could only call a number I knew.`
`Did God want me to do that, then?`
`There was only one coin.`
`I could only call one number.`
`And I couldn't talk for that long.`
`I had challenged God earlier, so it was just a matter of course to think that God was challenging me in return.`
`I had only one chance, and he wanted me to test my luck with that chance. `
`I left the phone booth and looked up at the sky.`
`Then I yelled in my heart.`
`You're on, God!`
`I wondered who I could call.`
` Who?`
`My house?`
`My parents were dead, and I had no relatives.`
`Even if I called, nobody would answer.`
`Actually, the phone bill wouldn't have been paid for a long time, so the phone line would already be disconnected.`
`My house was my lost life itself.`
`No, the debris of my life.`
`...Calling home would simply be an expression of regret...`
` ...which ran counter to the positive attitude of one trying to change their life.`
`So surely using the coin to call my house was wrong.`
`Which meant... I had to cast this ten yen coin towards my future.`
`Future.`
` My future?`
` What future, anyway?`
`Then I heard a huge thunderclap, which cleared my mind.`
`In that clear state of mind, I saw something from the past.`
`It was the last sight of my father.`
`His final moments on the hospital bed. Though suffering from pain, he tried to tell me something very important.`
`"If by chance...`
` I am to die,`
` turn to Dr. Takano.`
` Dr. Hifumi Takano.`
` Say it for me."`
`"Hi`
` fu`
` mi`
` Takano."`
`"That's right.`
` Dr. Hifumi Takano.`
` He's my former teacher.`
` He will`
` help you...`
` cough`
` cough!!`
` Cough!!"`
`"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!!!"`
`Many doctors came into the room in a hurry.`
`He wanted to tell me something else, `
`but the doctors stopped him from talking, so it wasn't audible.`
`It shouldn't have been... but it was to me.`
`I heard it.`
`I heard it, but I didn't want to hear him say it while suffering, so I pretended that I didn't hear...`
`He said it while coughing.`
` I heard it.`
`They were numbers.`
`......I swallowed once.`
`That's right,`
` ...It was...`
` a phone number.`
`He knew nobody would take me in, because we had no relatives.`
` He told me to get in touch with him,`
` Dr. Hifumi Takano.`
`He tried to tell me his phone number...`
`Ahhh, what had I done?`
`He tried so hard, using his last chance to tell me the most important thing...`
`The thunder from earlier had made me remember it.`
`The number I couldn't remember even once came out so smoothly.`
`I dialed it in.`
`This really was it.`
`This was the number for my father's teacher, Dr. Takano.`
`But my hand stopped just as I tried to put the coin in.`
`What if I hadn't remembered it correctly?`
`......No, there was no need to hesitate.`
`I had to believe in myself.`
`This had to be the correct number.`
`I had to dial it before I forgot it again.`
`I picked up the phone and put the coin in.`
`Beep...`
`I heard the dial tone on the other end.`
`At that point, I decided to kill myself if it didn't work.`
`I could go back into the woods and wait for another lightning bolt.`
`I could lie down and let the rain water drown me, too.`
`I could also fall asleep in the middle of the road and wait for a car to run me over.`
`I made up my mind and put the coin in.`
`I didn't hesitate any longer.`
` I dialed the number at once.`
`But, `
`I had to be careful.`
` If you dial quickly, sometimes you can make mistakes. `
`I was getting irritated, and that almost made the phone number go vague in my head.`
`I dialed the last digit,`
` and heard some electronic sounds on the other end.`
`I hoped that I dialed the correct number.`
`I didn't know what to say to Dr. Takano if it did connect.`
`Where was I?`
`What was I supposed to do?`
`What was I supposed to ask him?`
` I didn't know any of those things.`
`Making a call isn't cheap.`
`One ten yen coin would only buy me short time to talk.`
`The line must have connected then.`
` I heard a ring tone.`
`I only had a short time once someone answered the phone.`
`I thought for a moment that I should put the phone down.`
`Then I could at least get the coin back.`
`I could call back after sorting out my thoughts.`
`But then, someone answered.`
`"Hello,`
` this is the Takano residence."`
`".........Ah,"`
`I felt like I was suffocating.`
`......My memory had been correct.`
`I couldn't tell the age of the speaker, but it was a grown man's voice.`
`Anyone who was my father's teacher must have been quite old.`
`Never mind that.`
` I had to hurry and say something.`
` Hurry, hurry...`
`"Ah...`
` are...`
` are you Dr. Takano?`
` Uh...`
` ooh,`
` Dr. Hifumi`
` Takano?"`
`"......Hm?`
` Yes, who is this?"`
`He must have been suspicious.`
`I couldn't blame him.`
`A stranger was asking him about his name. Of course he'd get suspicious.`
`"I'm sorry...`
` I'm Tanashi.`
` Miyoko Tanashi."`
`"Tanashi-san?`
` Yes."`
`"Uh... My father told me to get in touch with you.`
` His name is Takemitsu Tanashi."`
`"...Tanashi`
` ...Tanashi.`
` ......Ah, Tanashi-kun!`
` I remember him!!"`
`His voice suddenly changed.`
`Dr. Takano had remembered his old student.`
`"I'm his daughter!`
` He told me to call you..."`
`"Did something happen to Tanashi-kun?"`
`Aah, not good.`
`I was going to run out of time...!`
`"My parents died in a train accident.`
` And I was told to call you."`
`"Tanashi-kun is dead...?!`
` I see...`
` Both of them?`
` I'm sorry to hear that.`
` I knew him from when I was teaching at a college.`
` He was a very hard-working young man. `
`I think the last time I saw him was at the wedding..."`
`Obviously, he didn't know I was born.`
`But he remembered my father.`
` That was truly a stroke of luck.`
`"So, what did Tanashi-kun want to tell me?"`
`"Ah... well........."`
`I didn't know what to say.`
`I was only told to call Dr. Takano.`
`How could I tell him that?`
`My time was running out.`
`I felt more and more anxious by the minute...`
`...Phone calls are disconnected without notice.`
`But somehow, I sensed it.`
`I only had enough time left for one sentence.`
`So I decided to say one sentence filled with all of my hopes.`
`"H-Help meee!!!"`
`The phone call got disconnected.`
`Maybe he only heard part of what I said.`
`I could only hope he was able to sense my despair. `
`I couldn't hear anything from the receiver anymore.`
`But I actually talked to Dr. Takano.`
`I confirmed that Dr. Takano existed.`
`He existed, and he remembered my father.`
`If he grieved over his student's death, he would come visit my house.`
`And he would find out I was sent to an orphanage.`
`Then he would come get me.`
`That's when tears flowed down my cheeks again.`
`I'd thought that my life was hopeless.`
`I never knew that finding even a grain of hope could make me feel so happy and strong.`
`The voice I heard on the phone was so warm and dependable.`
`My father must have thought about me for a long time in that hospital bed.`
`And came up with a name that he could trust his daughter with.`
`Dr. Hifumi Takano.`
`So I could trust Dr. Takano.`
` I had to believe that he would find me.`
`But it might take more than just a few days.`
`I'd have to wait patiently.`
`A few days?`
` A month? More?`
` I could only wait patiently.`
`Either way, I couldn't stay in the telephone box. The staff would easily find me there.`
`I went out into the rain again.`
`But this time, the rain felt a little warmer than before.`
`I had wished to die by lightning.`
`...But after that phone call,`
` I was filled with hope and the will to live.`
`I wanted to live, and that was why I felt pain all over my body.`
`When I still wished to die, I didn't feel anything.`
`I had to wait patiently until Dr. Takano came to pick me up.`
`I had to get to The House of Love and Mercy.`
`That would be the best place to wait for him.`
`I didn't think the orphanage would tell him I escaped to The House of Love and Mercy.`
`But The House wouldn't stop me from calling him.`
`All I'd have to do was call him again and let him know where I was.`
`But I didn't know where I could find The House of Love and Mercy.`
`I couldn't see any signs anywhere, and I didn't even know what direction the orphanage I escaped from was in.`
`But I couldn't just stop.`
`I had to walk.`
`I had to find shelter.`
`I had to find someone and ask for directions to The House of Love and Mercy.`
`I had to keep going, because I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.`
`The chills and throbbing pain tormented me, but I couldn't die until I met Takano-sensei.`
`I wished a car would come by.`
`If it was someone who lived in the area, I could ask.`
`But the police wouldn't do me any good.`
`I was sure the orphanage had already called the police about our escape, and they wouldn't be forgiving.`
`The police were sure to send me back to the orphanage.`
`Either way, I wished that someone would show up.`
`Otherwise, I'd have to keep walking on the asphalt in the darkness forever...`
`How long did I walk?`
`Still no car...`
`Just as I couldn't help but think that maybe the world perished, leaving only me behind, a car showed up.`
`I sensed the car coming up behind me, so I turned around. I saw their headlights approaching me.`
`...I thought for a moment.`
` Should I stand in the middle of the street to stop the car?`
`It was so dark.`
`I didn't think the car would notice if I just waved at it.`
`But if I were to stand in the middle of the street, I could get run over...`
`While I thought, the car was getting closer and closer.`
`When I made the phone call, I panicked and didn't know what to say.`
`So with this car, I'd have to think very carefully.`
`If I couldn't think of anything, then I should just let the car go.`
`With those thoughts vaguely on my mind, I was incredibly surprised when the car slammed the brakes with a screech and came to a stop.`
`...Maybe I wasn't all there after that miraculous experience of lightning striking near me.`
`...I had half lost my mind in those dark woods, so I probably wasn't thinking very straight.`
`Because...`
`The car had stopped after recognizing me. In other words, the driver knew who I was.`
`...And the only people in the area who would recognize me were...`
`Suddenly, a chill ran through my whole body.`
`I started to dash away.`
`I heard a voice calling after me.`
`I no longer had the strength to run.`
`My feet were trembling, and I couldn't make them cooperate.`
`I realized then that I shouldn't have sat down in the telephone booth.`
`That was why I couldn't keep running.`
`I was suddenly grabbed from behind, the collar of my clothes almost choking me.`
`I heard fabric being ripped.`
`I fell in a puddle, and a staff member got on top of me.`
`...This time, his finger wasn't in my mouth.`
` All I could do was struggle.`
`As I did so, I remembered all the scary stories Eriko and the others told me.`
`All the torture the child who was caught had to endure.`
`The Drowned Ducky Punishment, the Mashed Caterpillar Punishment,`
` and the Splayed Piggy Punishment.`
`The names of those eerie-sounding punishments came to my mind.`
`I screamed and struggled with all my might, but it was too late.`
`I was shoved into the back seat of the car.`
`Why couldn't they just let me go?`
`Simple: they didn't want me talking about them to anybody.`
`The staff were yelling and screaming while chasing me, but once we were in the car, they went silent.`
`It was like the grim reaper had come to get me.`
`Whether I liked it or not, I had to come to terms with the fact that my luck had run out.`
`But...... but.`
`I had called Takano-sensei.`
` ...So I knew he would come to get me.`
`I didn't know when that would be, but I knew it would happen some day.`
`So, I wanted to live. I would be saved if I lived.`
`I couldn't even imagine the kind of punishment that was waiting for me.`
`But even so, I said to myself...`
` I have to live!`
`I'd already found the light at the end of the tunnel.`
`All I had to do was endure until I reached it.`
`The car stopped.`
`We had arrived at the front gate of the orphanage.`
`The two staff members grabbed my shoulders so I wouldn't run.`
`...My shoulders were very skinny, so it hurt a lot.`
`I was scared.`
`Scared of what I would have to go through.`
`We went through the door, and I was finally sheltered from the rain.`
`...In a way, I wasn't sheltered at all, though.`
`It was the middle of the night, and long past time to turn all the lights off.`
`The orphanage should have been quiet.`
`But... I heard a noise.`
`It was a strange noise.`
`The noise of a shower.`
`The noise of metal objects crashing into each other.`
`Also the staff's yelling and screaming.`
`A chill went down my spine.`
`...Ahh, what could I possibly write down to fully describe this fear...?`
`A staff member knocked on the door of the storage room, and the door opened.`
`...The moment it did, an angry roar issued from inside.`
`The sight leapt into my eyes.`
` ...I couldn't completely take in the bizarre scene before me.`
`Two staff members were hitting a mat with bamboo swords while yelling violently.`
`It was a mat`
` used in... you know,`
` the one you use when you do gymnastics.`
`But why was it rolled up like that?`
`The rolled-up mat was tied with a string and was standing up in the corner.`
`The staff members kept hitting it.`
`Usually words are said to a person.`
`But why were they yelling at a rolled-up mat? The way they were hitting and yelling at it, it was as if they'd gone mad.`
`But wait... I could see something sticking out from the top of the rolled-up mat.`
`It was...`
` let me see...`
` whose shoes were those?`
`All of a sudden, I froze, and couldn't think anymore.`
`One man stood in front of me.`
`The man's pinky finger was wrapped in bandages.`
`My eyes`
` moved upwards from his pinky finger`
` and met with his.`
`...The beast's eyes met mine, peering with intent to devour me.`
`I squeezed out a voiceless scream.`
`My voice didn't come out, so it was more like a goldfish opening and closing its mouth.`
`The beast stuck his little finger in front of me and roared.`
`I couldn't tell if it was a word or a meaningless shriek,`
` but I was certain it was something abusive.`
`I was scared.`
` I didn't want to die.`
` I wanted to live.`
` I knew that Dr. Takano would show up to save me.`
` That was why I had to live, and submit myself to the fear.`
`"I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!`
` Ahhhhhhh!!!"`
`The hand with the bandages grabbed my hair and dragged me along.`
`All I could do was apologize and beg for forgiveness while hoping the beast had even a tiny bit of mercy in him.`
`I was like a broken, apologizing doll.`
`A mad doll, that kept muttering apologies until its key wound down.`
`I was their toy... shedding tears, coughing blood, and apologizing in place of clicking gears.`
`I could see into the shower room while he dragged me along.`
`The door was open, and I heard wailing from the inside.`
`What I saw was very strange.`
`There was a locker on its side in the shower...`
` what an odd sight...`
` A locker was taking a shower, sideways.`
` ...I'd never even imagined anything like it before.`
`The locker was taking a cold shower while two staff members hit it with bamboo swords.`
`That explained the metallic noise I heard before...`
`The beast didn't want me to see that.`
`He pulled my hair violently and twisted my neck so that I looked in the opposite direction.`
`Then I realized.`
` He didn't do that to stop me from watching that shower.`
`He did it to make me look at something else.`
`I saw a window and a courtyard.`
`Usually it was too dark to see anything.`
`But the lights were on, and the courtyard was very bright.`
`Then I saw it.`
`Inside of the henhouse,`
` I saw XXXXX.`
`What is that?`
` XXXXXX, and XXXXX... XXXXX!!`
`That hair was Eriko's.`
` XXX?`
` XXXXX!!!`
` But why was she XXXXX!`
` That was far too XXXXX!!!`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaah!!`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,`
` I am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`I don't want to die!!`
` I know Dr. Takano is coming to save me, I know he is coming!!!`
`I was taken to the staff bathroom.`
` It stunk of ammonia.`
`I saw an XXXX, which just doesn't fit in a bathroom.`
`Why was this in the bathroom, I thought.`
`He's not planning to XXXX me with XXXX, is he?`
`No way!! No, no, no, no!!`
`"Tanashi,`
` this is your punishment for breaking the rules, okay?`
` Everyone must follow the rules.`
` If you don't, you get punished. Do you understand?"`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!`
` I'll never do it again!! I'll do everything you tell me to do!!`
` I promise, I really do!!!`
` Please spare me!!`
` Please spare me from XXXX!!`
` No, that hurts, no, no, no, no!! `
`Nooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
