`Takano-san always comes along with me whenever I go to take pictures on a stroll.`
`She might have discovered the joy of cameras, and I'm happy to gain a friend who shares the same hobby.`
`However, there's actually something else she's much more interested in.`
` ...That would be the history of Hinamizawa.`
`She frequently visited libraries and local archives to read through various documents and books, and when it comes to Hinamizawa, she's gained quite extensive knowledge of the local history.`
`When she's in a good mood, she tells me about things like how Hinamizawa used be called Onigafuchi Village, and how the villagers there used to perform various cruel ceremonies based around the worship of Oyashiro-sama.`
`It seemed she loved tales of violence, and that actually gave her a mysterious charm.`
`...On the other hand, I don't do well with grotesque things, so I can hardly say anything in response.`
`The stories of cruel ceremonies that she gets excited about... I don't really get them all that well.`
`However, with the way her eyes light up when she talks, I don't mind spending time with her even if I have to hear about cruel things.`
`"You sure like looking into that stuff, don't you?"`
`"Sure, it's fun!`
` It's thrilling to unravel a dark past that has been sealed away!! Don't you think so?"`
`Takano-san smiled in a way that almost made it sound like a dark past is something fun.`
`...But, of course, it isn't.`
`The dark history of Hinamizawa that she loves is something cruel and atrocious, like the witch hunts in the Middle Ages.`
`"Besides, they help me in researching Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`You don't have to always look through microscopes to research things. Sometimes, the traditions of this village that have spent so long with the parasite can teach us things that are far more valuable."`
`"That's true.`
` ...Boy, you sure are passionate about this."`
`"Hee hee.`
` That's because research gives my life meaning.`
` To step into the unknown and to uncover a secret that nobody else knows... don't you think that's wonderful?`
` It tickles my intellectual curiosity. `
`That's probably the greatest entertainment available to humans, who can feel joy just from thinking. `
`The first person to work on this, Dr. Takano, must have discovered something fascinating enough to make him devote his entire life to the researching of the syndrome too. `
`...I think I'm probably the only one who could understand his feelings.`
` ...I suppose it would be too difficult for you, Jirou-san, since you're not a researcher.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`She always seems so enthusiastic every time she talks about the late Dr. Takano, an independent researcher who was the first person to discover the existence of the syndrome.`
`There has to be something more there than just her admiration as a researcher.`
`...Come to think of it.`
`Dr. Takano's full name was Hifumi Takano.`
`...Takano-san's full name is Miyo Takano.`
`Not only are their last names pronounced the same, but their first names follow a similar pattern.`
` ...They must be connected somehow.`
`I don't know anything about Takano-san's personal history, but there's a good chance that her name is an alias.`
`So it's very possible she chose a name to reflect the researcher she admires.`
`"I see...`
` So is that why you chose that name?"`
`"...What?"`
`"Well, the name of the researcher you look up to is 'Hifumi Takano', right? `
`And your name is Miyo.`
` In Japanese, it's like you're counting upwards.`
` You're continuing the research he wasn't able to complete, so I thought maybe that's why you have that name."`
`".........Who told you that?"`
`"Eh?`
` No, ahahahaha, I just thought of that now.`
` I didn't hear it from anybody."`
`"Hee hee.`
` ...You're correct.`
` I'm surprised you figured it out, since you're so dense."`
`"I know you admire Dr. Takano`
` and sometimes you've spoken as if you were his daughter or a granddaughter, who inherited his research legitimately.`
` That's why I said that. `
`Even authors, like Ranpo Edogawa, used their pen names as homages towards authors they admired as well.`
` So I thought maybe the name you use is like your pen name, you know."`
`"No, that's not so.`
` Miyo Takano is my real name.`
` ...You write my family name differently, though."`
`"Eh?`
` Then it really is the exact same family name as Dr. Takano?`
` That's even more of a surprise!`
` And Miyo is your real name too...`
` Miyo Takano continuing Hifumi Takano's life's work...`
` What a fateful coincidence!!"`
`"Hee hee.`
` You're overstating it, Jirou-san.`
` This isn't fate of any kind.`
` He's my grandfather."`
`"......What?!"`
`This is news to me.`
`I heard Takano-san discovered documents about the Hinamizawa Syndrome left by Dr. Takano after his death, and decided to continue his research.`
`I've never heard of them being related before.`
`"Someone told me it'd leave a bad impression if I asked for money to continue my grandfather's research; that people may think I'm trying to pull funds for a family matter.`
` That's why I changed one of the characters in my last name. `
`So other than Uncle Koizumi,`
` you're the first person I've told this to."`
`"......I... I see.`
` ......I didn't know.`
` So that's why you're so passionate about all this."`
`I understand very clearly now.`
`She really did inherit the work her grandfather was unable to complete.`
`"My grandfather researched Hinamizawa Syndrome not only from a medical point of view, but through old documents and literature as well. `
`Looking through the old stories of a village that has been living with the syndrome for hundreds of years can be far more valuable than looking through microscopes that magnify things hundreds of times. My grandfather taught me that."`
`"...I see.`
` I'm sure your grandfather is happy that you're finishing the work he couldn't.`
` I bet he's really proud of you."`
`"Hee hee hee hee.`
` I hope so."`
`I said something Takano-san would normally tease me about, but she didn't. She nodded and smiled.`
`...There's no mistake.`
` She is indeed the granddaughter of Dr. Takano.`
`"My grandfather is Hifumi, which means 1, 2, 3.`
` And I'm Miyo which means 3, 4. `
`Following after my grandfather, we have only counted the 3 together.`
` And counted the 4 after my grandfather.`
` We must reach the 5 that neither me nor my grandfather has seen yet.`
` That is my duty and the reason I was born."`
`"So that's why your name is Miyo, huh?`
` I think that's a beautiful name."`
`"Thank you.`
` But please keep the granddaughter issue to yourself.`
` My clients don't even know, and I don't want any unnecessary problems from them finding out about it."`
`"Ahahahaha, sure.`
` Okay.`
` This is a secret between you and me, huh?"`
`Although it's only a small secret, it feels good to think that I'm the only one who knows about it.`
`"......I've only counted to 3.`
` I haven't even reached 4 yet.`
` The path before me is long and rough, but I will do it.`
` I will expose the secrets of Hinamizawa Syndrome."`
`"I'll support you...`
` ...Ahaha, that's my job in the first place, isn't it?"`
`"Geez.`
` You'd sound pretty cool if you didn't tack on things like that.`
` You only needed to say that you'll support me, you know."`
`"Ah, ahahahahaha...!`
` Okay, I'll support you."`
`"It's too late.`
` You're not cool if you can't get it right the first time.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`We laughed cheerfully together.`
`And after we finished laughing, she became serious again, and spoke as if to drive the point home.`
`"So remember, Jirou-san.`
` Don't tell anybody that I'm his granddaughter, okay?"`
`"Okay,`
` I promise."`
`"It's not a bad thing,`
` but I don't want the clients to cut our funding because of that."`
`"I don't think they will.`
` Besides, I won't tell a soul!"`
`"Are you sure?`
` Are you really, really sure...?`
` This research is the entire purpose of my life.`
` My mission is to complete my grandfather's work. `
`To prove that his trampled research is actually something amazing that will shock the world and to make everyone praise my grandfather who is perishing away under the earth, eventually having him ascend as a god. That's the meaning and purpose of my life. ......Jirou-san, `
`if you say something that creates problems for my research...!!"`
`"...D-Don't worry. I'll forget everything you told me here."`
`"............"`
`"Really, I mean it.`
` I won't say anything."`
`"............"`
`"I promise.`
` ...I won't say anything!"`
`"...Are you sure, Jirou-san?"`
`I sensed something frightening within her for a moment.`
`Afraid that she would end up possessed by it, I swore to keep the promise.`
`Her intellectual curiosity as a researcher and her conviction to complete her grandfather's work are what stirs her passion for researching Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`......I think there's one more reason, `
`but it's far too deep`
` and it's within a wound in her heart that someone like me should never touch.`
`But earlier...`
`She said...`
` "If you create problems for my research..." I wonder what she wanted to say after that...`
`I can't help thinking she wanted to say something terrifyingly merciless.`
`I kept my promise with her`
` and we never talked about the issue again after that.`
