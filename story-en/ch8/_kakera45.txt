`This game piece has a very important meaning for us.`
`Because it showed us for the first time that it was possible to poke a hole in the fate of the June of 1983.`
`To start from the conclusion, everything gets taken in by Rule Y at the end, and all our effort is wasted.`
`But we're challenging the great law that governs this game board, Rule X, head on.`
` We're using everything we've learned so far from other Fragments, which prove we can defeat it.`
`We grow by learning.`
`In a game with no hope of winning, we can discover a slight chance of victory.`
`This piece taught us that.`
`With this game piece, Rule X was almost completely defeated.`
`Keiichi Maebara and our other friends won't be led astray by something as pathetic as the Hinamizawa Syndrome and dance in tragedy any longer.`
`It has also taught us that the Rules aren't indestructible, and are possible to overcome.`
`In other words, it has given us, the ones who are on the outside of the game board, hope.`
`...It's an important Fragment that serves as our turning point, and the trigger for everything else.`
