`Someone once suggested that believing is like placing a bet with coins of hope.`
`In other words... believing means taking a risk.`
`You gain something if you win, but you lose something if you fail.`
`As with any gamble, we try to make sure we win and then bet a coin.`
`But, as with any gamble, there's no guarantee of victory.`
`Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.`
`And that's how you increase the number of coins you have.`
`But if you keep losing, you don't want to continue gambling.`
`It's then that you realize`
` that, if you don't gamble, you don't have to lose anything.`
`Not gambling on anything is the same as not believing in anything.`
`Not believing in anything is the same as not involving yourself in anything.`
`And not involving yourself in anything is the same as not existing.`
`Therefore, she didn't exist.`
`The one coin she had in her heart was the last one.`
`If she lost it, she'd disappear.`
`...That was why she was hesitating to make a bet.`
`She had been running, trying not to get involved in any type of match, because she was afraid of betting it by accident.`
`But just like in a game of poker,`
` she could lose her coin by folding.`
`She tried not to lose her last coin... but that meant she was going to lose it eventually, anyway.`
`There was something she didn't know.`
` Actually, I didn't know it at the time either.`
`The more coins bet into the pool... the higher our chances of winning this game.`
`In other words, the more frightened we are, the more we'll keep losing the game before us.`
`It's just like carrying a portable shrine.`
`It's impossible to carry such a heavy thing by oneself.`
`But when people put their strength together, they can lift it easily.`
`There's a clear borderline between 'too heavy to lift' and 'easily lifted'.`
`It's just like how the balance on a scale tips with just a little weight.`
`The big, heavy shrine before us couldn't be lifted.`
`Everyone tried their hardest to raise it, but couldn't.`
`I didn't help because I was sure it couldn't budge.`
`I don't participate in games I know I can't win.`
` So I didn't bet my coin.`
`...But,`
` that was wrong of me.`
`Maybe the portable shrine could have been lifted if I joined.`
`For the longest time, I'd been pretending to be a bystander.`
` I always thought I was there just to find out if my coin was worth betting or not.`
` But that was wrong! `
`I'm not just an onlooker, nor should I be a bystander.`
` I should have participated!`
`The game I've been facing doesn't look like a game I can win.`
`It doesn't look like a game that's worth betting on.`
`But by betting on it, or by participating in it, or by believing in it, the outcome might change.`
`To gamble on something is the same as to believe in something.`
`To believe in something is the same as to be involved in something.`
`To be involved in something is the same as to exist.`
`Therefore, she existed.`
`"Okay everyone, homeroom is starting!!`
` No more chitchatting!`
` Class rep, go ahead!"`
`"All rise!`
` Bow!"`
`"Good morning!!"`
`"Sit down!!"`
`Rattle, rattle, rattle.`
`It's an ordinary morning.`
`The only difference is that it started a little later than usual.`
`Chie-sensei normally arrives in the classroom right away, but she's a little late today.`
`Why was she late for homeroom?`
` The rumors were already stirring about the classroom before she arrived.`
`Chie-sensei gave a cue, and a girl peeked in the room timidly.`
`"......Au au au..."`
`"This is a new student, Hanyuu Furude-san.`
` She's going to be joining us starting today."`
`"""Woooow!!!!"""`
`The voices of welcome, delight, and surprise all mixed together and filled the classroom.`
`"Furude?`
` Is she related to Rika-chan?"`
`"......Yes, she is.`
` She's my distant relative."`
`"My, that's quite a surprise even to me!!`
` I was uninformed that Rika had relatives."`
`"Hey, this ol' man didn't know either!!`
`Well, the three families are rather complicated...`
` I wouldn't be surprised if I had distant relatives myself."`
`"But she sure does look related to Rika-chan!`
`Hauuu, what a kyutie!!"`
`"......Au au au..."`
`All my classmates had gotten excited.`
`The new girl looked rather intimidated by it all.`
`Rika-chan is rather carefree, but this Hanyuu seems like the complete opposite.`
`She's more like a shy woodland animal.`
`...The exact type that Rena loves.`
`...Look, see.`
` Rena is ready to swallow her whole...`
`"Okay, Hanyuu-san, please introduce yourself.`
` Settle down, everyone!`
` Go ahead, Hanyuu-san."`
`Chie-sensei left the podium and encouraged Hanyuu to take over.`
`The even greater pressure of the silence left her standing there timidly for a little bit.`
`...Well, that's understandable.`
` It's very nerve-wracking to watch, though.`
`"...Um...`
` Au au...`
` Uhh, I'm Hanyuu Furude.`
` ...Uhh...`
` au au...`
` I'm Rika's relative..."`
`"...Meep~!`
` She's my relative.`
` Please be nice to her."`
`Rika-chan can tell that she's too nervous to introduce herself.`
`She's right to break the silence.`
` Pressuring her like that isn't fair.`
`...Which is why I decided to make it more lively.`
`"You're called Furude, just like Rika-chan, huh?`
` Now we have two Furudes in this class."`
`"Then how about we call her Hanyuu-san?`
` If we call her Furude-san, Rika might think we're addressing her, don't you think?"`
`We generally call each other by our first names here.`
`She's one of us starting today, so we should call her by her first name too.`
`"Okay, it's decided!`
`We'll call you Hanyuu!`
` I'm Mion Sonozaki, the class president!`
` Call me Mion, okay?"`
`"Oh ho ho ho!!`
` I am Satoko Houjou.`
` Very pleased to meet you, Hanyuu-san!"`
`"Ah, um!!`
` I'm Daiki Tomita!`
` My parents run a tofu shop! Please come by anytime!"`
`"I, I, I'm Suguru Okamura!`
` Please ask me if you don't know anything..."`
`"Hello!!`
` Let's be friends, okay?`
` What grade are you in?"`
`Our classmates fell over each other to introduce themselves.`
`Everyone tried to get her to remember their names so they could be friends. A friendly atmosphere swelled in the room.`
`I've only just transferred recently myself, but this is exactly how it was on my first day too.`
`I remember how nervous I was, and how much I appreciated this as a result.`
`I know more than anyone how nerve-wracking it is to be a new student.`
`I should look after her!`
`"I agree.`
` We'll have to help her blend into the class quickly."`
`"Right, you were a new student last year, huh?`
` Were you nervous on your first day too?"`
`"Yep.`
` But Mii-chan and the others were so nice to me that I got used to the class pretty quickly."`
`"Well, yeah!`
` To welcome a newcomer to the village is one of the Three Families' important duties."`
`"You only mention the Three Families when it suits your purposes.`
` But it's true that you all helped me get used to such a different environment."`
`"In that case,`
` doesn't that mean it's your turn to look after her, Kei-chan?"`
`"Yeah, I thought so too!`
` Rena was a new student, but she looked after me when I got here.`
` So it's my turn to look after the next new student!!"`
`A new student always dramatically changes the atmosphere of a class.`
` Even my attitude has changed.`
`We decided to gather around Hanyuu during lunch break.`
`"Okay!!`
` Remember, you can only ask Hanyuu one question each, okay?`
`Why don't we ask her some personal questions so we get to know her better~?`
` Let's see, who'll be the first to go~?"`
`"Uh, uh, uh, uhh...!`
` Um... what is your favorite food?"`
`"...Au, I like sweets.`
` My favorite kind are cream puffs."`
`"Oh, that's wonderful!!`
` I love cream puffs too!`
` There's a very good sweets shop in Okinomiya.`
` I'll take you there sometime."`
`"Okay boys, did you all hear that?`
` If you want Hanyuu to like you, get her some cream puffs, okay?`
` Not the cheap ones though. Get her something expensive!!`
`Let's see, who's next?! `
`If there's no one else, I'll ask what color her underwear is today!"`
`"...Au au au!"`
`Everyone kept asking Hanyuu questions, and she looked all panicky again.`
`I guess this is like a traditional ceremony for a new student.`
`I remember this is exactly how my first day went.`
`Mion and Satoko seem amused, so it must be the same for them too.`
`I noticed Rena watching the scene before her with a distant look in her eyes.`
` She's probably remembering her first day too.`
`"Are you recalling what it was like?"`
`"...Eh?`
` ...Ah, yeah.`
`Ahahaha."`
`"Were you thinking about something else?`
` You aren't thinking about taking Hanyuu home, are you?"`
`"H-Hau?!`
` No way!!`
` I'm not thinking that since Hanyuu-chan likes cream puffs,`
` and since I have some good cream puffs at home, that she should come over or anything like that!`
`Hauuu!!`
` I'm taking her home with me!!"`
`"Ahahahahahahaha, if she doesn't come to school tomorrow, it'll be your fault, Rena!"`
`"Hau, that's mean~.`
`Ahahahahaha."`
`As we watched Hanyuu and our classmates have fun, Rena and I laughed together.`
`"...Hey, Keiichi-kun.`
` This sure is great, huh?"`
`"Yeah, it is.`
` It's great to meet a new classmate."`
`"Ehh......`
` no, not that...`
` I mean...`
` I think I've seen her a few times before."`
`"Hanyuu?`
` Maybe you saw her when she and her family came to look at the area before they moved here.`
` You sure have a good memory, Rena."`
`"...No, it's not like that...`
` ...Hanyuu-chan has been here for a long time... She's been right beside us all the while, watching us play together.`
` ...For ages now.`
`...Huh?`
` Is it just me?`
` Didn't you notice, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"...No, I haven't seen her before.`
` So are you saying that you've met her before, Rena?"`
`From what I can see, this is the first time Mion and Satoko have met Hanyuu.`
`If she's been that close to us, like Rena said, it's impossible that none of us would remember her.`
`"Are you sure?`
` Besides, Hanyuu is a transfer student.`
` She couldn't have been here in this village that often."`
`"...Hmmm...... do you think so?`
` I swear I've seen her pretty often..."`
`"It's your imagination.`
` Even Hanyuu just said she was living far away before she moved here."`
`"...Hmmm...`
` ...But I've seen her before...`
` ...Hau."`
`Rena looked like she was trying to remember more.`
`It's probably one of those deja vu experiences.`
`Although it is the first time you see something, it feels like you've seen it before.`
`"Oh well, just forget about it.`
` She's here now, right?"`
`"Yeah, you're right.`
` Yeah.`
` She always seemed so eager to join us... So I'm glad that she's one of us now.`
` Aha ha ha ha ha!"`
`Rena smiled with tears in her eyes.`
`When I looked over at her, Rika-chan was wearing the same expression.`
`...It made no sense to me why those two looked that way.`
`But as soon as Satoko came over and pulled a prank on me, I forgot all about it.`
`"""See you laaaateeer!!"""`
`These are the words that signal the best time of the school day.`
`As soon as the last period ended, my classmates ran out of the room.`
`Hanyuu was popular all day today.`
`She's Rika-chan's age, so all the lower-grade students gathered around her.`
` Older students like me and Mion didn't have a chance to get close to her.`
`"Well, I'm sure they'd rather have a new student who's their age than a scary-looking older guy."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` That's right, you looked so scary at first, Keiichi-kun! It was probably because you were nervous."`
`"Hey, hey, that's mean!`
` I was trying to be friendly so I could get along with the class..."`
`"You were far from friendly!`
` You slapped me upside the head on your first day, Keiichi-san! Don't you recall?"`
`"That's because of how I was treated on my very first day!!`
` There was a thumbtack on the seat of my chair and even a frog in my desk!!!"`
`"We heard there was a new student in the teacher's office, so we went to take a peek.`
` We saw you there, and you looked so nervous that Satoko must have thought she had to do something to help you relax."`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` As your elder, I was being considerate, you see?"`
`"Tsk! That's impossible!"`
`Although, that blackboard eraser trap sure did help to ease my tension.`
`But Satoko will be so pleased with herself if I tell her that,`
` so I'll never admit it.`
`"Hanyuu-chan must have gone home with everyone else.`
` I'm sure she's still popular even after school."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` Still, your first day at a new school is always really exhausting.`
` I'm sure she'll sleep very well tonight."`
`"I'm quite sure too.`
` Oh ho ho ho!"`
`"Okay, everyone!!`
` It's been a while, since I've been busy with work quite a bit lately!`
`It's time for a club meetiiiing!!!"`
`"I've been waiting for this!!`
` It's been so long that I've gotten rusty!"`
`"......Meep~!`
` I've been bored because I haven't rubbed a loser's head in a while."`
`"Hauuu!`
` I won't lose!`
` I won't be holding back just because it's been a while!"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` You sure have pent-up frustrations, huh?`
` Great, that makes things even more interesting!!"`
`"Heh heh!`
` Everyone's motivated, huh?`
` You better watch out! I'm in top form today!!`
` Mion, you're going to wish you went to work instead!!"`
`Mion's had to work quite a bit lately because her uncle's shop is short on staff.`
` So we haven't done any club activities for a long while.`
`For us, club activities are the main reason we come to school!`
`In a way, we live for these few hours after school.`
` If there are no club activities, there's no point in coming here at all.`
`So it only makes sense for us to be excited about getting to have a meeting again.`
`"I guess none of us will be satisfied with an ordinary game...`
` Heh heh heh!`
` What should we play?"`
`Mion looked into the club locker.`
`I'm always curious about what's in that locker and how much of it there is.`
` I swear there's more in there than it can realistically hold.`
`Just then, we heard the door open.`
`"...Oh?`
` Hanyuu-chan?"`
`"...Au.`
` ...H-Hello."`
`"What are you doing here?`
` Did you forget something?"`
`I thought she had already gone home.`
`Did she forget her lunchbox or something?`
`It's not that big a deal to forget a textbook, but you can't forget a lunchbox.`
`"...Au au au au..."`
`"Hm?`
` Hanyuu, what is it?`
` Are you looking for something?"`
`Hanyuu looked at us apologetically.`
`What is it?`
`Are we in the way?`
`She kept staring at us timidly.`
`Hmm?`
` Are we sitting in Hanyuu's seat?`
` No, that's not it.`
`"What is it, Hanyuu-chan...?`
` Can we help you? Can we?"`
`"...Au au au..."`
`Rena talked to her, but there was no communication to be had.`
`Almost like trying to have a conversation with a stray cat.`
` ...What is this?`
`Hanyuu was fixated on something.`
`I followed her gaze, and found Rika-chan.`
`Hanyuu's apologetic gaze was directed at Rika-chan.`
`"......Meep."`
`"...Au au au..."`
`"......I won't say anything.`
` If you want it, you need to say it yourself, Hanyuu."`
`"......Au au au..."`
`With that, I finally figured it out.`
`Hanyuu wanted to say something, but she didn't know how to say it, so she wanted Rika-chan to say it for her.`
`But Rika-chan told her to say it herself.`
`In other words, we need to listen to what Hanyuu has to say.`
`We patiently waited for Hanyuu to speak up.`
`But when I think about what happened this morning, I realize this kind of silence makes her even more nervous.`
`Rena, noticing that, talked to her in a sweet tone of voice.`
`"What is it, Hanyuu-chan?`
` Can you tell me?`
` I'll help you."`
`"......Au au..."`
`"Hm?`
` What is it?`
` Can you say it one more time?"`
`"......Au au au au."`
`"Hmm, hmm.`
`......Hm...`
` Eeeeh?!"`
`Rena raised her voice.`
`"What? Let this ol' man know too.`
` What is it?"`
`"Eh, ahh... Are you sure?!"`
`"What could it be?`
` Please share it with us all."`
`"Ahh, well...!"`
`"...I... I want to join your club...!"`
`"""Eeeeeeeeh?!"""`
`Hanyuu said it loudly, as if to shake off her embarrassment.`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Now that's a surprise!`
` Where did you hear about us?"`
`"Au au au...!`
` I want to join...`
` I want to join your club..."`
`"......Very good. You did a great job.`
` Clap, clap, clap☆."`
`Rika-chan must have known that Hanyuu wanted to join the club all along.`
`Mion folded her arms with a smile and stared at Hanyuu as if appraising her. Needless to say, Hanyuu was intimidated.`
`"Hmmmmmm,`
` you're awfully reckless, jumping into mortal peril by choice.`
` ...But our club isn't just any old club.`
` Only a select few are allowed to join, and that's only after passing a gruesome trial. `
`Just because you want to join doesn't mean you can, you know...?!"`
`"Ah, look, Hanyuu-chan...`
` Mii-chan's club might look fun, but...`
` hau, you know... it's not that easy."`
`"...Au, I already know that..."`
`"You have to win,`
` otherwise you don't know what might happen...`
` Are you sure you're aware of that?"`
`"...Au, I won't lose...`
` ...B-Besides..."`
`Hanyuu swallowed once and said what was on her mind.`
`It sounded like a big thing to say for her, as though it had a much deeper meaning.`
`"I used to hate to lose, so I always ran away from every game.`
` But running away is even worse than losing.`
` I can win only if I continue to fight, despite the pain of failure.`
` ...That's something I've learned."`
`"...Hanyuu."`
`When Mion realized that, although she looks timid, Hanyuu is actually very courageous, she grinned.`
` Looks like she's grown fond of her.`
`"Well, well.`
` She's got guts!`
` How about it, Mion? Why don't we let her try, huh?`
` Let her take the entrance exam!!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` Heh heh heh!`
` It usually takes more than a few weeks to determine if one is even qualified to take the exam, yet she wants to take it on her first day...`
` Hmmm, what should I do? Heh heh heh!"`
`Mion pretended to be stubborn, but in reality, she was simply playing with her.`
`If she actually didn't want her to join, she would have refused her right away.`
`Of course, if Hanyuu was bothered by this kind of intimidation, she wouldn't be able to survive in this club.`
`"Just like Rena and Satoko said,`
` our club is relentless!`
` Winning should be your utmost goal.`
` Always aim for first place.`
` And if you come in last, you will wish you were never born."`
`"...Au au au!`
` I'll do my best..."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` The punishment for losing is actually kinda fun too."`
`Hanyuu-chan, you've been watching the whole time, huh?`
`You've been wanting to join for the longest time, huh?`
`...I got the feeling that Rena had just mumbled something like that.`
`"Come on, Mion, let her try.`
` I got in by going through that too, you know."`
`"Quite true.`
` Let us see what Hanyuu-san is made of!"`
`"Ahaha, have fun, Hanyuu-chan!!`
` ....I won't hold back, okay?"`
`"I-I... I won't hold back either..."`
`"......I'll only give you my best, Hanyuu."`
`"...Au au au au!"`
`"Very well!!`
` Hanyuu Furude, you're on!! You're allowed to take the entrance exam!!`
`Okay, then...!`
` We'll have to choose a game that Hanyuu knows how to play...`
` Hmmm, what would be good?`
` ...Oh!!`
` ...Heh heh heh!`
` What about this?"`
`Mion threw a deck of cards onto the desk.`
` Does this mean...?!`
`"We'll play a game that everyone knows!!`
` How about Old Maid?"`
`"...Au, th-that's fine...!"`
`Here she goes. This is exactly what I had to endure when I went through this entrance exam. `
`This is...`
` the marked tile deck!`
`"Oh ho ho ho!`
` That's a very enthusiastic response!!`
` However... our club's version of Old Maid is a little different, no?"`
`Most of the cards have scratches on the back, so by memorizing the scratches, you can tell what card it is.`
`In other words, the more you've played this game, the better you are at it. This is simply our way of being mean to newcomers.`
`"Ha-Hanyuu-chan, you can do it!`
` This is a trial...`
` hauu..."`
`"...Go for it, yay."`
`This sure brings back memories.`
` I had to go through this too...`
`It just happened recently, but I still feel so nostalgic!`
`"However!`
` That doesn't mean I'll go easy on you!`
` Just like how merciless they all were when I did the exam,`
` I'll put everything I've got into this!`
` Right, everyone?!"`
`"Prepare yourself, Hanyuu-san!!!"`
`"Here we go!!`
` If you want to join, let us see what you've got!!!"`
`"...R-Roger...!!"`
`"Heh heh heh!!`
` I'll call your hand from the right, okay?`
` Ace,`
` three,`
` four,`
` seven,`
` Jack,`
` and Queen!!"`
`"It's too late to hide now!!"`
`"Au au au au!!"`
`"Sorry, Hanyuu-chan, this is the Ace of Spades, right?`
`I'm out!!"`
`"Mwahahahaha, do you get it, Hanyuu?`
` This is the entrance exam for our club!!"`
`"...Meep.`
` Keiichi is putting his leftover grudge from his own entrance exam into this game."`
`"Come on, Kei-chan, are you sure you should be saying things like that?`
` Hanyuu, take Kei-chan's card on the right, that's what you need to win."`
`"...Au!`
` I'm done!"`
`"Whaaaat, that's not fair!!`
`Okay, I'm dead serious now!!`
` How dare you make me mad!!`
`Hanyuu, do you want to go home on a leash, wearing shorts with a tail on them on your first day?"`
`"My, my!!`
` I think you would look better in them, Keiichi-san!!"`
`"Hauuu, yes, yes!!`
` And I'm going to take him home with me!!"`
`"I-I'll make him do that punishment...!"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` That's a great idea, I'm in too!!"`
`"Hey, you guys, why are you picking on me, huh?`
` Fine then!!`
` I'm going to make all of you do it!!"`
