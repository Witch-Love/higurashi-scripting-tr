`This piece shows us the existence of the unreasonable Rule Z surrounding Satoko, and reveals the most powerful adversary rule on the game board, Rule Y.`
`Can the Rules X, Y, and Z be seen now?`
`The enemy we need to fight.`
` The things we need to learn.`
` All are gathered and revealed here in this Fragment.`
`At this point, it's impossible to reach Rule Y.`
`...Fighting against Rule Z's effect on Satoko is the best that can be done.`
`But, in this piece, we make a mistake in our approach for fighting it.`
`The outcome we gained through erroneous means is erroneous itself.`
`Keiichi Maebara learned that through his own experiences.`
`A tragedy doesn't possess the power to overcome tragedy.`
`Violence doesn't possess the power to overcome violence.`
`If they can grasp that, all the pieces on this game board will learn the true way to fight.`
`But Takano is too powerful.`
`The shocking end of this piece`
` doesn't allow us to learn it that easily.`
