`"Okay, I'll get going.`
` Thank you!"`
`"Don't mention it.`
` Come back anytime, okay?"`
`"Hi, I'm home!`
` Hey, Uncle Hiroshi.`
` Long time no see!!"`
`"Hey, Mion-chan.`
` Are you going home?`
` I have to give my clients a ride."`
`"A ride?`
` Ah, you're talking about your realtor business, huh?"`
`The Sonozaki family is one of the largest landowners here in the Hinamizawa area.`
`However, since all the land is out here in the countryside, it just ends up sitting there.`
`Recently, the land owned by the Sonozaki family was put on sale in lots.`
`At the family meeting, some of our relatives opposed the idea by saying we shouldn't sell off land that was handed down from our ancestors.`
` But Granny snapped and shut them right up.`
`Some of the unused fields were made into vacant lots and released for public sale.`
`Actually, I had some questions about it too.`
`The Sonozaki family is very wealthy.`
`We have plenty of land, as well as money.`
`So why did we have to sell it off?`
`What's more surprising to me is that Granny was the one who came up with the idea.`
`I would have thought she'd get furious if someone even mentioned something like that.`
`"Okay, if you're ever near the station, be sure to stop by.`
` I'll treat you to a cup of barley tea!!"`
`"Sure, thank you very much!`
` So how is your business going?"`
`"I'm surprised there are actually city folks who are interested!`
` They must be those nouveau riche types who live in the big city, yet also want a house in the countryside."`
`"Well, I guess some people are curious!"`
`"There's one family seeking to move here, not purchase a villa.`
` He said he wants to build a studio, so he must be an artist of some sort."`
`"Ho!`
` That's great!"`
`"Oh, gosh!`
` I better go now!"`
`Supposedly, he planned a tour to show them the lots, and he's the one driving the bus.`
`It should be about time for the tour and explanations to end.`
`He left in a hurry.`
`"Hey, can I ask you something?`
` Why did you want to sell our land? You don't like newcomers..."`
`"I don't like newcomers and I don't like big city people either.`
` ...But the village needs them.`
` It's like ventilating a room."`
`"Is it good for the village to have new people move in?"`
`"This is a wonderful village.`
` But the world is changing quickly.`
` In the past, a very small change took ten or even twenty years to happen. It was such a quiet and unchanging village."`
`"Well, that's rural life.`
` In this village, nothing is different from yesterday and today.`
` ...It's too boring for me, though!"`
`"But you made a friend, didn't you?`
` Rena Ryuugu-chan moved here and you got along great.`
` You told me you were happy that you had a friend your age."`
`"Yeah.`
` Making friends unexpectedly is fun."`
`"I remember you saying that school is boring when Rena-chan is absent.`
` Do you remember that?`
` Heh heh heh heh!"`
`"Are you saying that's the good thing about letting new people move here?"`
`"...No matter how cold it gets, you still have to ventilate your living space. Otherwise, it gets filled with bad air and you'll suffocate to death. `
`You open the window, even knowing the freezing cold air will come in."`
`"...Letting outsiders move here is like ventilating the village?"`
`"Sure.`
` It lets fresh air in and gets rid of bad air like us."`
`If I bring up the Houjou family, I know Granny will explode, so I won't.`
`But... I think what Granny is trying to say includes things like their ongoing isolation.`
`Even now, when she remembers about what happened at that explanatory meeting, she gets really upset.`
` But I guess even she feels that needs to come to an end.`
`But, of course, she can't just say she'll forgive them, not when she's at this stubborn age.`
`She can't lose face by openly saying they need to be forgiven.`
`......Honestly, I think she's behaving like a little schoolgirl who actually likes a person but treats them rudely when they're around.`
`...Maybe people really do go back to being children when they get old enough.`
`I'm not just talking about Granny.`
` The same can be said about all of the old people in the village.`
`...No, maybe I should say the evil around here.`
`That must be what she meant by bad air.`
`There's no use circulating the air in a closed room.`
`Unless you open the windows and let fresh air in, the air in the room won't be purified.`
`"We don't know if there's actually going to be people moving here,`
` but don't you think you're expecting too much from whoever does?`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`"Just Rena-chan moving here changed you, Mion.`
` Whoever moves here will change this village.`
` If possible, I hope some young and energetic people who have the charisma to lead will appear. `
`They need to be the ones to put us old people away into Heaven."`
`"Heh heh heh,`
` are you thinking about Gramps?"`
`"Damn you, nobody's thinking about him!`
` Here, have the housekeeper put away the tea set on the veranda."`
`"Okay, okay.`
` I will!"`
`"......Mion."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"...The day Satoshi Houjou disappeared, `
`you came to me, huh?"`
`"Ah, yeah, I guess I did...`
` Aha ha ha."`
`"That is...`
` what woke me up.`
` This problem with the Houjou family, we can't just let time take care of it.`
` We have to take care of it ourselves as soon as possible."`
`"But you can't do it yourself, `
`so you're going to have an outsider take care of it?"`
`"...That's the best I can do."`
`"No matter how bad your hand is, the next card can change the flow of the game.`
` So maybe it's a good idea to draw cards from the stack."`
`"Your generation will be a new wind. Let that new wind come from the outside.`
` And you'll be the wind from the inside. When both winds create a gale, the gust will blow away the stale air from the village."`
`"That's the epitome of leaving your problems to others.`
` You're the one who started the fire, and you're trying to have your grandchild take care of it?"`
`"...Oh, don't say that.`
` As the new leader of the Sonozaki family,`
` bring the new wind into the village."`
`"...If you're saying that's my job as your successor..."`
`"Please,`
` Mion.`
` I'm too old.`
` The only thing I can do now is to be despised by people."`
`The wind chime sounded quietly.`
`Maybe that's a sign to let us know a cool breeze is on the way...`
