`...I don't know what to do.`
`My name is Ichirou Maebara, and I am`
` hopelessly lost.`
`I came to Hinamizawa on a tour to find a lot for a vacation home.`
`When the realtor finished explaining some details, he told us to take a walk until the departure time.`
`Such beautiful scenery and fresh air...`
` I let my senses guide me and...`
` Here I am.`
` Where am I?`
`I still have a little time before the departure, but I am completely lost.`
`This is basically the middle of nowhere, but people actually do live here.`
`If I keep walking, I should run into somebody. Then I can ask for directions.`
`Don't worry,`
` ha ha ha.`
` The only thing I need to keep in mind is the departure time for the bullet train.`
`But the more time passes, the more I start to think I was being too optimistic about running into somebody.`
`...Because I can't find anybody at all.`
`Maybe I'm walking farther and farther away from where people are, in which case I'm in serious trouble.`
`So upon hearing someone's voice, I feel immensely relieved.`
`It sounds like little girls are playing nearby.`
`If it's a place where little kids can play, it must be a safe village.`
` I followed those voices.`
`Upon rounding the wild pampas grass, I can see a beautiful field.`
`Two girls are playing there.`
`They're dancing in the field filled with blooming wild flowers.`
` What I'm seeing is more beautiful than all of the great works of art I've ever seen put together.`
` Maybe I'm exaggerating, but this looks holier than any religious painting...`
`Why is it that seeing innocent girls dance around like this makes people feel this way?`
`...It's probably because we're sinners.`
`You can't live with pleasure and glory alone.`
` ...We sin, even as we live.`
`That's why we feel awed by the sight of innocence. It reminds us of the time when we were pure.`
`We grow up naturally`
` and we lose innocence as we do...`
` And we admire and adore the children who symbolize that which we've lost.`
`"......Meep.`
` There's a suspicious person who's mumbling some weird stuff over there."`
`"Au au au.`
` Rika, that's not a suspicious person."`
`"...Eh?`
` Aaah!!`
` Ahh, aah, s-sorry!!`
` I'm not suspicious!`
` Wahahahaha...!!"`
`"......But you've been staring at my chest and legs.`
` Nipah~â˜†."`
`"N-No, no! I'm not!`
` Don't turn me in! I really wasn't staring!`
` I was using this mirror to fix my hair!!"`
`"...Ahahahahaha.`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but it sure sounds interesting."`
`"......Like father, like son."`
`The girls teased me for a while, and when they got tired of doing that, they went back to dancing around.`
`Realizing that whatever I said would backfire,`
` I decided to leave them alone and sat down to watch them play.`
`...I wonder how old they are.`
`They seem rather young, but maybe they could be close to Keiichi's age.`
`If we move here, Keiichi might meet them at school.`
`If he would see them at school, then...`
` ...they were girls that lived here.`
`If all the children in Hinamizawa are like them,`
` then even if living a rural life may have some challenges... there's a good reason for us to move here.`
`...We're not very good parents.`
`We didn't understand what Keiichi was going through, and left him alone until the very end.`
`According to the parenting book I bought, the first few problems are calls for help.`
`It doesn't matter what the action itself is, but the fact that those actions are occuring is a primitive appeal from the child seeking communication.`
`...Humans can speak, and that's one of the reasons why we don't notice such signs.`
`We can only hear words through our ears, and we can't sense the signs coming from our son's heart.`
`Keiichi... probably thinks it's all his fault.`
`...Of course, he's not absent of blame.`
`Humans aren't dogs or cats.`
`We should know what's right and what's wrong.`
`But... it's our fault too, as his parents.`
`To let him think that he had to go that far for us to be able to understand him is really pathetic and disappointing of us.`
`If we had understood him and hadn't cornered him,`
` Keiichi wouldn't have done that.`
`So the incidents weren't only Keiichi's fault.`
` Everyone in the Maebara family was to blame.`
`I want to explain that to him, but he's still too young and hotheaded to be able to understand.`
`Right now, the guilt he's feeling is basically crushing him under its weight. He doesn't even have the will to live.`
`My wife is the same.`
` ...She's blaming herself for forcing him to study for better grades. She thinks that's why the incidents took place.`
`And I'm no different.`
` I'm blaming myself for not being involved in my son's education. I think that's why the incidents took place.`
`The cross will be forever on our shoulders, even after the injured child accepts our apologies.`
`Yet our cold society would tell us to die under the weight of that cross.`
`...Even so, we have to live.`
`We have to accept our sins and carry our burdens on our shoulders.`
`Maybe we can start a new life here in this village.`
`...I thought about all that as I watched the girls dance.`
`Keiichi needs friends like them.`
`Friends like those girls will offer him so much more than the friends who only talked about cram schools and exam results.`
`The girls are playing near a sign that doesn't fit in to this open field.`
`It's a sign about lots for sale, and the name of the realtor who brought me here for the tour is written on it.`
`...Does that mean`
` we can live`
` even in this beautiful area if we want to?`
`One of the girls spoke as if reading my mind.`
`"......This is a wonderful village.`
` You will find lots of things you don't have in a big city."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` I think so too."`
`"......But I think you'll bring some things from the city to this village that we don't have."`
`"Do we have anything?"`
`"Sure you do.`
` Au au."`
`"......We've lived in this village for hundreds of years just like this.`
` Nobody comes to visit, and nothing happens.`
` ...And so, nothing ever changes."`
`"Isn't that what's good about this place?"`
`"......Didn't you come here because you wanted to change something?"`
`"Yeah...`
` you're right about that."`
`"...We want new people to come here too.`
` It's like breaking the dam that keeps the swamp water from flowing out.`
` Water is purified by moving. If it stays motionless, then it's just a swamp."`
`"In fact, this village used to be named after a swamp up until the Meiji era.`
` ...But the name was changed to 'Hinamizawa'.`
` The water in a swamp stagnates because it doesn't flow, `
`but the water in a stream stays fresh."`
`".....Hee hee.`
` Besides, you all are the ones who will teach us that.`
` That dams can be broken, should be broken."`
`Are they playing riddles with me?`
`I have no idea what they're trying to say.`
`But there's one thing I know.`
` The villagers are waiting for new people to come here, and they want to build a future with those newcomers.`
`I looked at the sign behind the girls one more time.`
` So that I'd remember this place.`
`I've already decided.`
`".....We'll be waiting for you to move here.`
` Maebara."`
`"Oh,`
` there you are!`
` Sir!`
` How did you get this far out?"`
`A raspy voice from the distance ended this innocent moment.`
`It's the realtor.`
`I guess he's been looking for me because I didn't return.`
`"Sorry about that!`
` I got lost."`
`I apologized while scratching my head.`
`I turned around to look for the girls, but they weren't there anymore.`
