`Grandfather's articles were trampled on.`
`We have proof as clear as the pathogen causing Hinamizawa Syndrome, so why can't they believe in its life cycle?`
`...Because they've never heard of that before?`
`Because they can't imagine it?`
`Because there's no way something so absurd could be true?`
`Don't tell me that...`
`I can't bring myself to care about the limits of those commoners' understanding.`
`Why can't anyone believe the truth of my grandfather's article, which has been proven by the Irie Institute?`
`Why do people continue to believe that humans are a special existence?`
`Humans are simply a species of animal.`
`When various parasites that control their animal hosts exist, how can people declare parasites that use humans as their hosts don't?`
`...Wait, this isn't the problem.`
` Not at all.`
`Because everyone believed my grandfather's article up until now.`
`Isn't that why the Ministry of Health and the Defense Agency lent me their assistance?`
`But out of nowhere, they turned cold.`
`In other words, every bit of their help was because Uncle Koizumi had my back.`
`So nobody actually read my grandfather's article?`
`Did they just pretend to in order to make Uncle Koizumi happy?`
`What is the meaning of everything I've done up until today?`
`I thought I'd achieved something, but what have I really accomplished?`
`I don't know what's going on, and all I can do is wallow in grief.`
`The more I think about it, the more I no longer understand the meaning of my own life.`
`Didn't Miyo Takano...`
` devote her life to being useful for her grandfather?`
`...Then, I haven't done anything for him at all.`
`Count three with my grandfather and I go on to count four... what a crazy thing to say.`
`...No, no...`
`If I let my mind wander, doubt about myself and my life will slip in.`
`So I'm just going to fill the gap in my heart with alcohol.`
`Is it that strange to presume the existence of something that can influence human thoughts?`
`It's true that Hinamizawa Syndrome isn't the actual cause of ideology.`
`The best it can do is drive people mad.`
` Socialism or capitalism don't originate with it.`
`In the era my grandfather was living, you couldn't talk about the world without ideology.`
`The article came from that time and age, so some of its inferences may be exaggerated or biased, but that's no reason to deny its foresight.`
`You can't simply say it's crazy and push it aside.`
`Besides,`
` the most important thing they ignored is the fact that Rika Furude, the queen carrier, holds the fate of the village in her hands.`
`My grandfather had predicted the importance and danger of the queen carrier since beginning his research on Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`But the hypothesis of the infected community collapsing into madness if the queen carrier dies, is a Pandora's box that can't be proven.`
`It can only be confirmed after Rika Furude's death, and if she dies, it'll be too late.`
`But there's no mistake that Rika Furude is the queen carrier, and a very special existence.`
` It's clear from the various experiments we've performed that she has a special influence on the infected villagers.`
`Her death really could trigger the collapse of the entire village.`
`...That's no mistake...!!`
`My grandfather predicted it!`
`To say all of that sounds like a comic book... it's just too cruel!!`
`For them to call the various preparations we've made to protect her a fictional project that was used to tunnel funds...`
`What I'm doing now is simply what my grandfather was going to do.`
`Therefore, insulting my research is the same as insulting my grandfather.`
`According to my grandfather's article, the first thing that needs to be done when researching the syndrome is to protect the queen carrier.`
`Yet, they ridiculed that more than anything else.`
`The more I think about it, the more their words stick in my memory.`
`I can almost hear their voices, and I can't stop myself from covering my ears.`
`I'm sure the members of the board of directors think I'm crazy.`
`I was trying to petition for the Irie Institute to not be shut down, but it backfired.`
`The members must think that Hinamizawa Syndrome is some kind of joke, and I'm sure they'll push even harder now to put a stop to our research.`
`If that happens, I would have to go back to researching as an individual.`
`In other words, the same as what my grandfather did.`
`There's a limit to what an individual can do.`
`...It's doubtful if I would even be able to go back to researching it individually.`
`Once the Irie Institute is disbanded, everyone is obligated to keep it confidential until we die.`
`I signed a contract to that extent.`
`That's not just a simple promise.`
` If I were to break it, a special unit like the Mountain Dogs would come after me to ensure that I keep everything confidential.`
`Even if that doesn't happen...`
`the Irie Institute is to eradicate the syndrome within a few years and to bury every trace of it, including the results of our research.`
`This isn't the normal process of research and treatment.`
` They want to pretend nothing ever happened to begin with.`
`I wanted to continue and complete my grandfather's work... but what's happening now will result in the complete opposite.`
`I'm actually helping to eliminate my grandfather's hard-earned research from this world.`
`A treatment has been created already.`
`Although Irie is as passionate as I am about developing a cure, he's not particularly interested in any other aspect of our research.`
`...I hate to admit it, but he has more experience and talent than I do.`
`...I'm sure he'll come up with a plan for eradicating Hinamizawa Syndrome within three years as requested by the new board of directors.`
`...And that board of directors will provide just enough funds to bury the syndrome.`
`Irie will do that happily.`
`Just like the time when he disposed of all the research data on test medicine H170, as was requested.`
`All I can do is to passively hinder them, just like they did me...`
` while watching the Hinamizawa Syndrome get eradicated.`
`And when everything is over, I will finally complete an article which is destined to be destroyed.`
`...Should I kill myself with thoughts of it in my head so I can at least present the article to my grandfather?`
`...He won't be happy even if I did that.`
`...On the contrary, he'll be disappointed in me for throwing the research he spent half of his life on down the drain.`
`...He won't embrace me. I know that for sure...`
`I wanted to reveal Hinamizawa Syndrome to the world.`
`I wanted the world to acknowledge my grandfather's masterpiece.`
`...I wanted to carve his name in history...... and promote him to a god.`
`My grandfather waited, believing that day would come, and he must be patiently waiting still, even after entering his eternal sleep.`
`But... I ruined it.`
`I wanted him to become a god.`
`I was going to become a god myself too.`
`Then we will be together forever, and I'll never have to be alone.`
`If I become a god, God won't test me.`
`There won't be any unhappiness. There won't be a sudden train accident.`
`My grandfather won't go away, nor will Uncle Koizumi.`
`...I'll never have to go back to being alone.`
`...I am alone.`
`I have no allies.`
`I was just dancing in ecstasy on a stage without anybody watching.`
`I had only just realized that there was no applause, but only ridicule.`
`...No, it's doubtful that there was actually anyone in the audience to begin with.`
`My parents died, my grandfather died, and then Uncle Koizumi died...`
` Three times had God toyed with me with their rolls of the dice.`
`I thought I overcame each of those trials with my own strength, but I didn't.`
`I was protected by a new guardian each time.`
`And this time, I have no guardians left to protect me.`
`When I first arrived in Hinamizawa, I had every intention of challenging God and kicking him off of his throne.`
`But now, forget challenging God... I'm just a loser being played with.`
`I suddenly can't find it within myself to care about anything.`
`Because if I cared, I'd be swallowed by sadness. Soaking my heart in alcohol is all I can do to forget about everything.`
`A luxurious black car abruptly stopped next to me.`
`...I became sober immediately, as cars like that remind me of the time when I was captured after escaping from the orphanage.`
`Suspicious-looking men in black suits and sunglasses got out from the car.`
`...I realized it instantly.`
` They must have been sent by one of my clients.`
`Being involved in the development of a biological weapon, being the main person responsible for it, and on top of that, being mentally unstable.`
` They obviously don't want me walking around freely.`
`They're going to abduct me, seal me in concrete, and erase my existence...`
` Or so I thought.`
`I expected them to grab me and shove me into the car,`
`but surprisingly, they bowed deeply to me instead.`
`"Are you the vice administrator of the Irie Institute, Major Miyo Takano?"`
`"...Normally, yes.`
` ...I'm just a drunk loser at the moment, though."`
`"There is someone who would like to meet with you.`
` Could you please come along with us?"`
`"...Even if I refuse, you're going to take me along anyway, right?"`
`I'll be killed anyway... I can't make my grandfather's wish come true, even if I live...`
` Cynical thoughts like that ran through my head.`
`Then the person in the backseat said...`
`"We won't force you.`
` But I'm sure we can help."`
`I've never met this young woman before.`
` She must be around my age.`
`She knows about the Irie Institute, so she must be somehow connected to my clients.`
`She's too young to be one herself.`
`I bet a client who doesn't want to expose himself sent her.`
`Even if I live, I can't make my grandfather a god.`
` I can't be a god myself either.`
`Who cares about where a loser like me gets killed, anyway?`
`I made up my mind and got into the backseat.`
`As soon as I got in, the luxurious car smoothly took off.`
`Silence filled the car for a time.`
`...They're the ones that invited me.`
` I don't have anything to say myself.`
`"...Long time no see, though I'm sure you don't remember.`
` We met in passing at Koizumi-sensei's funeral."`
`"Oh, we did?`
` Sorry, I don't remember."`
`There were so many people at that funeral.`
` I can't recall any of them.`
`...But why is that what she's opening with?`
`...Does that mean she belongs to the Koizumi faction...?`
`"Koizumi-sensei was very active as one of the opinion leaders during the post-war restoration.`
` You can't begin to talk about the way the country is today without mentioning his accomplishments."`
`"............"`
`"When we were rebuilding the country from the burnt fields after the war, our nation's supporters were united, but unfortunately it's hard to say that now. `
`...As our time of peace grew longer and we started seeing the generation who didn't remember the burnt fields become key national figures, we saw a decline in those who understood the noble intentions we started with. `
`As the final remaining member of those noble men, Koizumi-sensei was the central pillar guiding us into the 21st century."`
`"...After his death, the Koizumi faction quickly fell.`
` As a result, other factions are extending their influence, leading everything to become quite a mess, right?"`
`I heard about these things from Jirou-san.`
`It's really no different from the Sengoku Era. When a lord or military leader died back then, the struggle to become his successor brought chaos to the nation.`
`...This country hasn't changed for hundreds of years.`
`"Exactly.`
` ...Unfortunately, while we built peaceful Japan into a comfortable place to live, the noble intentions that guided us from the outset have been forgotten. `
`Right now, various factions are fighting in Tokyo over the seat left behind by Koizumi-sensei.`
` If Koizumi-sensei and the other deceased servicemen ever found out about this, they'd be so disappointed."`
`"......What does that have to do with me?"`
`"Aren't you the biggest victim of all this?`
` I think you've had enough experiences with sudden shifts in the wind, haven't you?"`
`"............"`
`It's true that our research began because of Koizumi-sensei's support.`
`...And the pressures we faced under the anti-Koizumi faction have been tempestuous and cold.`
`Maybe for them, every project that Koizumi-sensei left behind is an eyesore, regardless of what that project is.`
`...In other words... that simply means they rejected the research itself, doesn't it...?`
`Come to think of it, something like this happened to my grandfather too.`
`Back then, Koizumi brought authorities from various fields to see him.`
`They talked down to my grandfather, despite the praise they'd given earlier.`
`Koizumi-sensei told me that the masterminds were responsible for that.`
`"It's not too much of a stretch to say that your research into Hinamizawa Syndrome is the number one leader in terms of funding, organization, and so forth in terms of projects within the Alphabet Project. `
`Therefore, it's been made into a scapegoat by those people who want to monopolize the interests of the Project."`
`"...A scapegoat?"`
`"What I mean is that your research into the Hinamizawa Syndrome isn't what they rejected.`
` What's important to them isn't the content, but the faction leading the project.`
` I wanted to tell you that today."`
`"In the end, I'm just a sacrificial goat put up for everyone to see, huh?`
` It doesn't matter what I research.`
` The only thing they care about is that we belonged to the Koizumi faction."`
`"That's correct.`
` The faction in control is like the direction of the wind.`
` Sometimes it's a tailwind, and sometimes it's a headwind.`
` Unfortunately, once the direction changes, it's not easy to turn it back around."`
`"So you're saying it won't be easy to bring my hostile clients back...?"`
`"That's correct. The Alphabet Project has been taken over completely. All of the directors have been replaced, and they're only interested in fulfilling their own desires. From the very beginning, they had no intention of listening to your explanation."`
`I grasped my knees, remembering that humiliating day.`
`"...Let me change the subject for now.`
` What would you consider the objective of your research, Takano-san?"`
`"Eh?`
` ......That is, to fulfill my intellectual curiosity..."`
`"Isn't it the promise you made with the late Dr. Takano, who you looked up to as your grandfather?"`
`...Well, that's surprising.`
`Koizumi-sensei once told me that this fact could become a hindrance, so I've never told any of my clients about it.`
`How did she find out?`
`If they know that,`
` maybe they know a lot more about us than I think.`
`"Where did you hear about that?"`
`"Koizumi-sensei told me."`
`"What?"`
`"We're not your enemies.`
` Please relax.`
` We're here to help you."`
`"............"`
`I don't know who she really is, but I know she's here because she wants something from me.`
`...So what is it that she wants?`
`She knows about the relationship between my grandfather and me, so I can't be careless.`
`"But, in order for us to help you, we need to have you tell us the truth.`
` In other words, we want you to be honest."`
`"...I don't know what you're trying to say."`
`"What is your true purpose in researching Hinamizawa Syndrome?"`
`To have my grandfather's masterpiece acknowledged for what it is, and to have him become a god.`
`"........."`
`"Isn't it to have the world acknowledge the late Dr. Takano's research`
` and to get revenge against those who trampled upon and looked down on the articles your grandfather wrote with all his heart?"`
`I'm reaching the limit of not letting my surprise show on my face.`
`How much does this woman know about me?`
`...In the first place, who is she?`
`How does she know everything I'm thinking?`
`"..............."`
`I can't admit that out loud, in any case.`
` ...I have appearances to consider...`
`But while this elegant woman was wearing an angelic smile...`
` she laughed with the devil's seductive whisper, several times better at it than I am.`
`A simple smile and a devilish grin are completely different.`
`An ordinary smile means goodwill, but a malicious smirk means the complete opposite.`
`This woman can read my deepest thoughts, and while doing so, she's testing me to see how honest I can be with her.`
`Whether I tell her the truth or not isn't the issue here.`
`She's testing me to see if I can trust her enough to confess everything.`
`"If I've completely misunderstood, please forgive me.`
` We'll take you to the nearest train station.`
` That'd be Gogura Station, wouldn't it?"`
`"......Well........."`
`"On the other hand.`
` If what I'm saying is somewhere close to what you're feeling...`
` I think we can help each other.`
` What do you think?`
` Miyo Takano-san?"`
`"........."`
`I can't say anything in reply, but I think that simply remaining silent might also be an answer.`
`...I want to hear what she wants from me.`
`I've always phrased my objective as some vague idea of turning my grandfather into a god.`
`...But she's just taught me what my true objective is.`
`I want to get revenge... for my grandfather's suffering.`
`I want those people to fight over the right to read the article they once trampled on and mocked.`
`I want them to believe... no, to worship... every single word my grandfather left behind.`
`That is my true objective...`
`This woman has stated out loud that which I have only whispered within myself. She even asked me if she was correct.`
`...Is this woman`
` an angel`
` or a devil?`
`If I'm a human, is she an existence above me?`
`"Your misfortune was that you didn't understand your true objective.`
` That's why you couldn't achieve anything. `
`You set an abstract goal like uncovering the mysteries of Hinamizawa Syndrome, which could never be achieved. So you couldn't help but to question the meaning of your own life. `
`Isn't that right?`
` Hee hee hee.`
` That's wrong.`
` Your actual objective, your earnest dream isn't so abstract. `
`Can you imagine?`
` Just think of this scene:`
` The true leaders of this nation are reading your grandfather's article. While shocked at its contents, they believe all of it without even a hint of doubt. `
`These people humbly read the article with footprints on its back. They express their respect at the insightfulness of his research and tremble in fear at its implications.`
` What do you think? Were you able to imagine it?"`
`......This is my first time envisioning something like this.`
`...And yet, it's been my dream all along.`
`"Your grandfather is the one who named it 'Hinamizawa Syndrome', yes?`
` ...That name will echo in every corner of this nation, and will be carved into eternity."`
`"Carved into eternity,`
` for all time."`
`"Indeed.`
` Your grandfather's masterpiece will be remembered forever.`
` Hee hee hee.`
` Isn't that the dream you've devoted your whole life to realizing?`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`My grandfather's masterpiece will be remembered forever.`
` Remembered.`
` Forever...`
`"And yet!!`
` Those pigs who couldn't understand turned your dream into a sacrifice, simply because of factional conflicts of interests. They're even trying to trample it into the ground! `
`......Just like how`
` they kept`
` trampling on your grandfather's article...`
` see? `
`Hee hee hee..."`
`"...............!"`
`"You must be full of regret.`
` The data you've worked so hard for is indeed the same as the article your grandfather did his best to produce.`
` You can't forgive the people who laughed at it. `
`You can't forgive those pigs who ridiculed your grandfather's masterpiece, right?`
` Aren't I right?`
` ...Oh, I know I am.`
` But you didn't think about that, because you're so kind as to not know how to condemn people. See?"`
`"............"`
`An indescribable emotion is filling me, making me feel like I'm suffocating.`
`The sensation of being cautious and calm, of trust and mistrust, are all blending together.`
`My heart is beating fast and my fingertips are shaking.`
`Why am I at peace?`
`Is it because she reminded me of my true dream, that I couldn't express with my own words until now?`
`Is it because she made me aware of the anger within myself?`
`Why am I hesitant?`
`Is it because she's reminded me of things I've never told anyone until now?`
` No, those are the things I've never even told myself.`
`"Hey... Miyo-san?`
` If`
` what I'm saying isn't wrong, `
`but is, in fact, completely true...`
` I know I can help you with both your dream and revenge."`
`"......Huff.........`
` ...huff......"`
`"Hee hee, what's the matter...?`
` Are you feeling alright?`
` If that's the case, I shouldn't keep you.`
` We'll take you to the nearest station."`
`"...N...... No......"`
`A small noise leaked pathetically out of my mouth.`
`Like a child apologizing for a prank.`
`"...Did you say something?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`I know she heard me. The woman smiled, trying to make me say it again.`
`"...That's not it...`
` I'm doing perfectly fine..."`
`"Hee hee hee.`
` I'm glad.`
` Let's continue, then."`
`"...If that is, in fact, my dream,`
` then what can you do?"`
`"I'll help you with both of your vengeances.`
` One is revenge for your grandfather.`
` We will make those people who ridiculed your grandfather's article humbly take it into their hands once again. The one they violated. `
`The other is revenge against the board of directors for trampling over your research, simply because of their factional conflicts. `
`Revenge against the filthy pigs who tried to stomp on not only your work, but on your life as well."`
`".....Getting revenge against the board of directors`
` by having them read my grandfather's article..."`
`"We'll be honest with you too. We're helping you because our interests are the same. `
`We can't allow the project that Koizumi-sensei established for the sake of Japan's future be eaten up by these lowlifes after his death. `
`If we had more power, we wouldn't have allowed that scum to become involved at all.`
` However, the wind started blowing in a different direction, and the project can no longer express Koizumi-sensei's ideals. `
`It has become a pigsty for them to satisfy their own desires.`
` Koizumi-sensei, who gave them the name 'Alphabet Project', would not have wished for it to remain this way. `
`The Project should have been shut down the minute it deviated from his ideals."`
`".........So you're trying to make the sacrificial sheep of the factional conflict into a wolf, are you?"`
`"If you choose to keep your grandfather's article hidden away in your heart, then I won't force you."`
`...No.`
` I won't let that happen.`
`I don't mind falling to the ground myself.`
`But at least... my grandpa...`
` My grandpa's article...`
`"Don't you want to make the article that represents you and your grandfather's lives into something that will last forever?`
` Hee hee, after all,`
` that's your dream, isn't it?"`
`"That's right...`
` That's my reason to live..."`
`"We'll give you a chance to make your dream come true."`
`On the night I decided I was a loser in life and drowned myself in tears and alcohol after being abandoned by everything,`
` I met someone who could be an angel or a devil.`
`Is this divine salvation, or the devil's seduction...?`
`I fought with the board of directors regarding the continuation of our research.`
`But that was completely off-target.`
` That wasn't my true goal.`
`My objective isn't to continue researching Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`It's to have the world acknowledge my grandfather's research as a masterpiece.`
`Somehow, the method for achieving that swapped places with my objective and caused me to misunderstand myself.`
`The purpose of my life isn't to continue my grandfather's research.`
`...It's to get revenge... and repay them for my grandfather's suffering.`
`That's what this woman is saying.`
`She's promising to make my grandfather's research eternal.`
`She's also promising an opportunity to take revenge against those who laughed at it.`
`When Uncle Koizumi died, I thought God was playing dice with my fate.`
`But my unshakable conviction gathered together a power stronger than God's die.`
`So maybe this meeting happened for a reason.`
`Curse you, God. You're testing me again.`
`I will overcome the death of Uncle Koizumi.`
`And I will make my grandfather an eternal existence`
` by taking revenge against the god who tested me.`
` I will,`
` for certain.`
`I will`
` take my revenge.`
