`C103's implementation on Satoko is going well so far.`
`It wouldn't make any difference to me if the experiment failed.`
`However, Irie's extraordinary focus and attention to the experiment has avoided Satoko Houjou hallucinating or turning into a vegetable during the experiment `
`...and surprisingly, we see prospects of her returning to normal life despite reaching L5.`
`C103 still has many issues, but this experiment proved that even a person who has reached L5 can be cured.`
`I didn't believe in it at first, but I guess I have to acknowledge Irie's hard work.`
`Only Irie could have done this.`
`He was tormented by naive humanism and didn't want to make mistakes, and that is why he felt obligated to cure Satoko Houjou.`
`The reason why I dislike Irie isn't because of his achievements or abilities, but because of that weakness...`
`But this time, I had to praise him for it.`
`"I saw your report...`
` ...I must tip my hat to you."`
`"No,`
` I only did my job as a researcher.`
` ...If that means fulfilling my duty as a doctor as well, then nothing could please me more."`
`"It's hardly an exaggeration to say that Satoko is now our most valuable specimen.`
` After all, she's the first human to reach L5 and live."`
`"...That's true.`
` We'll let her go back to her life and keep our eyes on her.`
` I'm going to tell her to come here every Sunday for a check up."`
`"But how are you going to explain to her that she has to give herself a C103 shot three times a day, and also that she has to come here every Sunday?`
` She has no subjective symptoms."`
`"I'm still trying to come up with a good excuse...`
` I think I'll tell her that I want her to help me with my research.`
` She has to give herself shots daily and to come here every Sunday for a check up. `
`I'll pay her for helping me. Or something like that."`
`...I guess Irie is determined to cure Satoko Houjou no matter what.`
`...He seems determined to keep her off the dissection table.`
`He and I are in different positions, but I don't have any complaints about his naive ideals so long as they translate directly into passion for our research.`
`If his plans can be put into effect and produce a different result than the dissection would, then they'll still be useful to the overall understanding of the Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`I have nothing against Satoko Houjou.`
`It's only that I see her as a research specimen.`
`If she can be useful in that capacity without being dissected, that's perfectly fine with me.`
`"We have to get permission from her guardian to give her shots three times a day.`
` After her parents died, her aunt and uncle have been taking care of her, right?`
` Maybe I'll go talk to them. `
`I hope they agree to her involvement in such suspicious research..."`
`"Oh, don't worry.`
` I'm sure they'll be happy to, once they realize they'll receive 100,000 to 200,000 yen every month for it."`
`"Do we have enough money?"`
`"Sure.`
` As long as we can produce documents that'll convince Jirou-san."`
`"Okay, then I'll work on that.`
` Also, we'll need to take action to prevent stressing Satoko-chan.`
` We don't want her to return to L5.`
` ...I hear her aunt and uncle are very mercenary. `
`Perhaps we can handle them with cash.`
` I plan to provide my help with their guidance too."`
`I've heard Satoko-chan isn't getting along with her aunt and uncle.`
`I never thought that'd affect us in any way.`
` But now, Irie has to deal with them.`
`Maybe he's developed some kind of sense of responsibility or duty as her guardian.`
`I don't really care.`
` The more responsible he feels, the more progress our research makes.`
` That'll be a plus for me.`
`"...By the way,`
` I saw the report on H170."`
`"Oh,`
` compared to your success, it's nothing. But I guess it was some kind of accomplishment."`
`"...It's honestly ironic.`
` This same research center that's produced the remedy to save her from derangement has developed a dangerous drug that could instantly induce it."`
`Irie wasn't involved in the H170 research.`
`That was my work.`
` In fact, even if I asked him, he wouldn't have agreed to be involved.`
`This dangerous reagent was developed during the process of uncovering the mechanisms behind how the pathogens controlling Satoko Houjou's brain could induce derangement or paranoia in their host.`
`To put it bluntly, injecting H170 into a patient with Hinamizawa Syndrome forced them to express terminal symptoms.`
`It threw the brain into a simulated state of agitation, intentionally forcing the pathogen to grow unstable.`
`If we continue researching this, it will be possible to drive anyone with Hinamizawa Syndrome violently insane at any time.`
`Studying the mechanism behind that will help to solve the syndrome's mysteries.`
` So this study on H170 will be extremely important to future research.`
`Also, this medicine has military applications, as the client requested.`
`At this point, there's absolutely no use for it.`
` But once our research progresses a bit further, this H170 could be spread at the right moment to cause a certain type of reaction.`
`Compared to a killer virus, it seems like a useless pathogen. `
`But there's no way to detect it in a dead body, and it makes it look as though the person just went insane spontaneously, so it must have some useful applications.`
`The Marco Polo Bridge Incident threatened to end research on Hinamizawa Syndrome before.`
`A historically important incident like that couldn't have been created by a killer virus.`
`But it's possible with Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`The elders of the Alphabet Project, the sponsor for our research, can think whatever they want about that.`
`I don't care how they use what I've learned.`
`My purpose is to solve the mysteries of Hinamizawa Syndrome and to make people realize how important this research is.`
`Also, to make people acknowledge my grandfather's accomplishments and achievements.`
`...Any military applications were just byproducts of the process that I didn't care about.`
`"The clients will appreciate your accomplishment.`
` Maybe our budget will increase for next term."`
`"Hee hee.`
` Passion alone can't keep research going.`
` We need money."`
`"...We must thank the sponsor for giving us so much funding...`
` ...For this much money to come from public expenses..."`
`"Maybe Japan is richer than I thought.`
` They're public expenses, but they're expenses that can't be made public.`
` Hee hee..."`
`Irie has no idea what I had to go through to get that money.`
`Anyway, our research is going extremely well.`
`We don't know what we'll find out about Hinamizawa Syndrome,`
`but I'm sure every mystery will eventually be solved. I can hardly wait.`
`What the syndrome indicates is that humans are simply empty containers, and what we believe to be our will is simply the actions of parasites that live in our brains.`
`If that mystery was solved... it would have a greater impact than anything else in history.`
`That is a truth which nobody wants to believe.`
`This is an achievement my grandfather predicted back during his time.`
`Ah, I know now.`
`I know the reason why my grandfather was so fascinated by his work.`
