`Huh? The old man from the Kimiyoshi branch family is here too!`
` He'd been struggling with health issues since Watanagashi last year, but it looks like he got better!"`
`"Now, it's time for Hinamizawa's very own food critic, Judge Satoko Houjou, to give her impressions!"`
`"......You would do well at product demonstrations in a supermarket."`
`"...I suspect he would be good at selling off suspicious wonder-knives."`
`"Keiichi-kun... Your nose is bleeding..."`
`"That looks fun. I'll try it too."`
`(We're right at the scene of a rendezvous, of course~.`
` See, look closely.`
` Can you tell who they are?)`
`"What's this...? Keiichi-kun, you sure are smart, you know that?`
` Having a secret date in a place like this?`
` Then I guess we accidentally interrupted something important. A-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`You're the ones who were meeting up secretly!!`
`"Wait, so you two weren't having a little rendezvous, then?"`
`"Heehee...`
` Unfortunately, this wasn't the location of a rendezvous either of you would want to see.`
` Sorry for not living up to your expectations."`
`"Hmm.`
` If this wasn't a rendezvous, then what were you doing?`
` Tomitake-san, were you messing around with the padlock on the door just now?"`
