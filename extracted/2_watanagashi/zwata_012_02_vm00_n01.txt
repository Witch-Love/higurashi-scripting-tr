`"At the time... Onigafuchi Village had already lost its impenetrability.`
` ...The villagers, once worshipped as transcendents, were now on the receiving end of inhuman treatment...`
`The sacred Onigafuchi Village had been groundlessly labeled an isolated village of those afflicted with incurable diseases, a mere shadow of its former self...`
` and stood on the precipice of an era of hardship."`
`"......It even caused trials.`
` ...They would appeal that where one came from wasn't an important enough reason to divorce.`
` ...They would, however, lose their case. `
`...Lying about one's birthplace apparently constitutes a heavy act of misrepresentation in marriage..."`
`"...During the Pacific War, despite the slogans that all the country was acting as one... those from Hinamizawa continued to suffer all manner of discrimination.`
` ...There were too many ways to count. `
`"Sohei said that he managed food warehouses in Harbin after being dispatched to the Chinese mainland. When it was time to pull out, he conspired with his superiors and comrades and stole a great deal of the army's canned goods. `
`"...However... around 1955, the wind started blowing in the other direction again...`
` ...because of the 'Canned Flesh Incident.'"`
`Canned flesh......`
`"Someone naming himself as my grandfather Sohei Sonozaki's superior confessed...`
` that those canned goods had been human flesh."`
`"The unit Sohei was in did way kinder research than that.`
` ...They were researching concrete methods for reducing the difficulty of delivering food on the battlefield."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...They were researching ways to handle using humans as food. `
`...Fighting onwards, sometimes eating the flesh of enemies and sometimes that of allies, became the ultimate service paid to their country.`
` ...They were deathly serious about this doctrine.`
` ...It really is a riot. `
`My grandfather was despised as someone who ate human flesh, and yet they had gone above and beyond that.`
` Apparently he always thought about it, too. `
`Even if he was a vulgar, man-eating demon, they were far more ugly demons than he.`
` So no matter how much he was scorned, he wouldn't put up with it."`
`"...I don't know if it's true.`
` Sohei denied it was human flesh up until the day he died.`
`However, those who begrudged Hinamizawa's sudden revival called him a savage for making a fortune from selling human flesh... and the villagers began to be scorned again. `
`...They returned to a time where children would be jeered at and have rocks thrown at them."`
