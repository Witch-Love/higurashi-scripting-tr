`"At the time... Onigafuchi Village had already lost its impenetrability.`
` ...The villagers, once worshipped as transcendents, were now looked down upon as freaks...`
`Far from the truth, the sacred Onigafuchi Village had been groundlessly labelled...`
` and stood on the precipice of an era of hardship."`
`"...During the Pacific War, despite the slogans that all the country was acting as one... those from Hinamizawa continued to suffer all manner of discrimination.`
` ...There were too many ways to count. `
`"Sohei said that he managed food warehouses in Harbin after being dispatched to the Chinese mainland. When it was time to pull out, he conspired with his superiors and comrades and stole a great deal of the army's canned goods. `
`"...However... around 1955, the wind started blowing in the other direction again...`
` ...because of the 'Canned Flesh Incident.'"`
`Canned flesh......`
`"Someone naming himself as my grandfather Sohei Sonozaki's superior confessed...`
` that those canned goods had been human flesh."`
`"The research undertaken by the unit Sohei was more realistic and less harsh than that.`
` ...They were researching concrete methods for reducing the difficulty of delivering food on the battlefield."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...They were researching ways to handle using 'ingredients' not ordinarily eaten as food. `
`...Fighting onwards, sometimes eating from the most undesirable food-sources, became the ultimate service paid to their country.`
` ...They were deathly serious about this doctrine.`
` ...It really is a riot. `
`My grandfather was despised as someone who ate human flesh, and yet they had gone above and beyond that.`
` Apparently he always thought about it, too. `
`No matter what the rumors of him were, they were far uglier demons than he.`
` So no matter how much he was scorned, he wouldn't put up with it."`
`"...I don't know if it's true.`
` Sohei denied it was human flesh up until the day he died.`
`However, those who begrudged Hinamizawa's sudden revival called him a savage for making a fortune from selling human flesh... and the villagers began to be scorned again. `
`...They returned to a time where children would be jeered at and have rocks thrown at them."`
