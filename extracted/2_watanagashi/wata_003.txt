`"Listen up, everybody.`
` If you don't take cooking seriously somebody's going to get hurt.`
` This is part of your education as well, so don't fool around and do it seriously!"`
`A lazy "yeaaah" wafted through the class in response.`
`Half of the school day today was going to be home economics class.`
`The plan was for everybody to make curry rice, and give it to the forest rangers who let this building be rented out as a school.`
`If everybody were making curry in the same pot, it would have been more of a party-like atmosphere, but this was school, after all!`
`Excluding the youngest students, each one of us would be making our own curry, with the results being judged.`
`"Alright, everybody.`
` It may be that nowadays curry is an easy meal anybody can make, but it has its roots in traditional Indian cuisine.`
`Even though we've altered it a bit in the Japanese style, it is still instilled with the knowledge and culture of Ancient India.`
` Absolutely do not neglect that fact.`
`I'll have words with anybody who doesn't take this seriously, so be prepared for that."`
`...That seemed like a needlessly passionate sermon on curry. ...Well, whatever.`
`"It's rumored that Chie-sensei has devoted her life to curry.`
` She'll probably be a pretty strict judge."`
`"As long as you're not failing, your grade in Home Ec doesn't really matter. Doesn't really matter at all."`
`"I wouldn't say that if I were you...`
` The teacher's a tyrant when it comes to curry."`
`"...What the heck does that even mean? A Curry Tyrant?`
` ...Never heard of that before."`
`"You see, our normally mild-mannered teacher...`
` ...for some unfathomable reason is a stickler for curry!`
`"Yeah.`
` It's said that every year she goes on a journey to India to research mythical curry."`
`"...This is just a rumor, but... It seems that she eats curry rice three meals a day, and if she occasionally has something else, it always has to be curry flavored."`
`"That's... not unyielding, that's unnatural.`
` Is she part of an evil cult or something...?`
` Besides, doesn't curry top the list when it comes to junk food? `
`Curry three times a day is just weird nutritionally speaking and—"`
`*THUNK THUNK THUNK*`
`Embedded into the table right by my fingertips—a chef's knife, ladle, and spatula—hummed gently as they still quivered.`
`The teacher, while still mixing her own pot, was looking this way, smiling.`
`"Ke-Kei-chan, shhhhhhh!!`
` ...If you say any more you'll be sleeping with the fishes...!!"`
`Saying even a little bit more would make my situation a lot more dire.`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` ...Just be serious and make your curry properly and everything's good, alright?"`
`"...I don't think it's going to be that easy today."`
`"Look... Mii-chan is..."`
`...It's written all over her face.`
`...If the playing field is even, and we're being judged... There's no way this won't turn into a competition!`
`"It looks like we're all on the same page!!`
` It's a Cooking Conteeeesst!!"`
`I knew it!!`
` There's no way Mion would leave such an enticing event alone!`
`"How shall we determine the victor?`
` By how the teacher judges it?"`
`As if saying "but wait, there's more!", the teacher reappeared with the principal in tow.`
`"The purpose of today's event is to show appreciation for the people at the Forestry Service, so they'll be judging the results with me."`
`"Yup. Your teacher and I, as well as five people from the Forestry Service, will be judging your cooking!`
` Good luck to everyone!!`
` Gahahaha!!!"`
`E-Even the principal!?!?`
`Looking around, it seemed like the interests of everybody in the class had been piqued.`
`"So that's what's happening.`
` This isn't going to just be some casual curry cook-off!"`
`"Rena is good at making curry!`
` I'm not going to lose today!"`
`"My grade is cooking in a group, so I'm together with Rika."`
`"Th-That's unfair!!`
` I'm pretty sure that Rika is good at cooking!"`
`"...My curry is so tasty it'll send shivers down your spine."`
`What about Mion!?`
`She doesn't seem like she's too good at cooking.`
`Her type has always been bad at this kind of thing.`
` ...But Mion continued to look unconcerned.`
`"Hehehe...`
` ...I'll tell you what Kei-chan is thinking right now.`
` ...'Mion is definitely bad at cooking.'`
` ...Am I right~?"`
`I... I don't like the way she said that.`
`...It couldn't be... Mion couldn't possibly...`
`At that moment, the teacher's whistle sounded.`
`"Alright everybody, are you ready?`
` Be very careful with the knives.`
` Start~!!"`
`The call to arms had sounded!`
`We had to use an outdoor kit to cook the rice, but it wasn't that difficult for a camping veteran like me.`
`Put the rice into the canister, push your palm to the bottom... and fill with water to just above the wrist.`
`"Are you alright with only that much water?`
` If you don't put in more it could be bad."`
`You filthy liar.`
`If I put in any more, I'll just be left with some half-cooked porridge!`
`"Satoko, if that's meant to be a trick, it won't work.`
` I'm used to cooking rice with these utensils!`
` First it starts to bubble, then the steam starts to puff.`
` And don't take off the lid no matter what!"`
`"Hmmm... Keiichi-kun, you're amazing!`
` This is a little unexpected.`
` Did you learn this at summer camp?"`
`"My dad really likes to go camping, see.`
` Whenever summer comes around, our family goes a lot."`
`"So this means... everybody is good at cooking the rice.`
` In other words, the critical part of this challenge will be the curry!"`
`"Hmph!`
` Curry is Rika's specialty!`
` We'll cream you all!!"`
`"...You lost me at 'Rika's.'`
` Why don't you help with the cooking too?"`
`"Hmmm,`
` maybe... Satoko-chan is helping the most by doing nothing at all☆."`
`"Eep!!!`
` The ends justify the means!!! I just have to win!!!"`
`That was a pretty malicious comment for Rena.`
`And Satoko took it hook, line, and sinker. Rena could only apologize between fits of laughter while Satoko chased her around.`
`"Well now... should we move on to the curry?`
` For now the battle truly begins!"`
`After rinsing off the carrots, potatoes, and other standard vegetables, I grasped the knife. ...*gulp*`
`"What~ will today's curry taste like~♪"`
`As Rena hummed along, her very well-practiced hands wielded her knife.`
`The rhythmical sound of the knife hitting the cutting board harkened to kind images of days long past.`
` ...Simply put, it was perfect.`
`It was so calm and practiced... I seriously don't stand a chance!`
`I looked over at Satoko and Rika-chan.`
`...Satoko was in charge of washing the vegetables, while Rika-chan was in charge of peeling them.`
`...That's what I heard being discussed... but Rika-chan's knife-skills are something else as well!!`
`She was happily rotating the potato and peeling it quite quickly.`
`On top of that... the peels spanned the entire potato.`
` What was that called again? Katsuramuki?`
` I've heard that peeling a vegetable in one loop around like that is a highly-regarded technique.`
`She picked up the peel from the sink and carved a pair of eyes into it with her knife...`
`"...It's a snake. Roaaaar."`
`Saying that she placed the longly-peeled potato skin on top of the head of a boy from her group.`
`...She wasn't even breaking a sweat.`
` ...When it comes to Rika-chan and cooking... I couldn't even hold a candle to her.`
`...But ...Roaaaar?`
` Do snakes make that sound?`
`Alright then, how's Mion doing?`
`She's definitely just fumbling along!`
`There's no way she can peel a potato so effortlessly like that!`
` Absolutely no way!!`
`"This can't be!!`
` You've got to be kidding me!`
` This a trick! She's using special effects!`
` Where's the wire? She's definitely using a wire!"`
`"Hehehehe...`
` Here, take a looksie."`
`As if she had already won, Mion proudly showed me the elongated potato skin.`
`"...You didn't know, Keiichi?`
` Mii was taught how to cook by her grandma."`
`"Not just cooking~.`
` From sewing to flower arrangement to playing the koto. From marksmanship to radio operation. Even helicopter piloting is but one of the myriad things she can do!"`
`...Strangely enough, the latter items were more realistic.`
`It was the first few items on that list that seemed like a lie.`
`"She's actually really good at cooking.`
` ...It's just such a hassle that she never does it though~."`
`D-Dammit!!`
`I'm also really good at cooking!`
` Especially Chinese food!!`
`"...Keiichi, boiling something and pouring it into a bowl doesn't count as cooking."`
`Shot down before I could even say it.`
`"Oh ho ho!!`
` Too bad for you!!`
` Today Keiichi-san shall be assuredly languishing in defeat all alone!!!"`
`*clank!!!*`
`"Tough words from somebody who can't even cook by herself!!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
` Rikaaaaaa~"`
`"There there.`
` ...I'll destroy Keiichi for you."`
`Gah! ...This does not look good...!`
`Everybody is smirking at me!`
`Don't raise the white flag yet, Keiichi Maebara!!`
`Don't throw away this match!`
`Calm down and think!`
`Not about how to peel these potatoes well.`
` ...But about how to win this challenge!!`
`"...There's too many people watching.`
` I'm... going to work at another sink."`
`Saying only that, I gathered up all the vegetables and left that spot behind...`
`"Will Keiichi-kun be alright?`
` I'm worried he might cut himself with his knife..."`
`"Let's see what Kei-chan's doing~!"`
`No matter how hard I try peeling these, if I slip up at this speed I'll lop my fingers right off!`
`Then... there's only one thing left to do!!`
`"Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun!`
` Oh, you guys were in a group of four, huh."`
`It was the two underclassmen that had become my sworn brothers ever since the event at that toy store last Sunday.`
`They had been paired with two girls for their group.`
`"Yep.`
` Both the girls are pretty good at cooking."`
`"So both of us can just mess around and we'll be okay."`
`...Both of them pointed at the girls.`
`...They're not as good as Rena, but they were both good enough at handling a knife.`
`"I'll get straight to the point.`
` At this rate, I'm going to lose this contest!`
` Give me the vegetables your group has peeled already."`
`"Ma-Maebara-san,`
` ...That's pretty much theft.`
` ...But depending on what's in it for us..."`
`"In other words, it depends on the terms of negotiation."`
`"Hmph, quite bold of you guys!`
` ...Well, that's to be expected.`
` Then let's do this.`
` If I win, I'll let you eat the curry that Satoko and Rika-chan's group makes.`
` How about that?"`
`"Eh,`
` ...Ah.`
` ...I-I don't know about that..."`
`Both of them were hesitant after such a weighty proposal... just one more little push seems in order.`
`Very well then, let's make them an offer they can't refuse.`
`...I pulled both of them close by the shoulders and made my offer in a hushed tone.`
`"...Of course, that includes the part that Satoko and Rika-chan have already eaten some of.`
` I'll even throw in the spoons."`
`*splooge*`
` A red mist spouted vigorously from the noses of the two underclassmen.`
`"Hmm...?`
` ...Keiichi-san... is also pretty good at this...!`
` Those are some very nice potatoes."`
`Having brilliantly cleared the vegetable peeling challenge, I returned to my comrades in triumph.`
`"Whoa, amazing, amazing!`
` Keiichi-kun's peeling is really good!"`
`"...Hmph.`
` That's not quite right.`
` What Kei-chan has bared isn't a potato, but his fangs!"`
`"Yeah...`
` I'm super serious about this.`
` I'll crush you all!!"`
`Having finished with preparing the vegetables, next is to boil a pot of water, then add the vegetables in order of which takes longest to cook.`
` ...I learned this part from my mother when we went camping.`
`But... just cooking in order... it probably won't garner a lot of points.`
`Look over at Rena... she had a variety of vegetables cooking together in a delicate balance.`
`She wasn't being ambitious or calculating a way to win the game.`
` ...She was making delicious food with a mother's touch...`
`I have a feeling that I could somehow compete with Mion in terms of technique, but I would be no match for Rena...`
`...She was way out of my league...`
`"When my mother makes curry, you see, she always uses lots of ingredients.`
` That's why Rena's curry uses a lot of ingredients as well.`
` ...I really wanted to take all night and stew it nice and slow... hau."`
`"...I beg of you.`
` Will you please help just a little with my curry..."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` No.`
` This is one of our club activities!`
` Rena won't lose~!"`
`Ugh, when she enters Club Mode, even the normally kind Rena becomes an enemy...`
`Looks like Rika-chan is cooking apples as well.`
` ...Uggh ...she's like a pro at this.`
`How about Mion?`
`"Wha-- Mion you--!!`
` What the heck is that!?`
` Where did you get meat from!?"`
`"I predicted what we would be doing today by looking at the schedule.`
` ...So I prepared accordingly.`
` ....My curry is going to be... maaaahvelous~!!"`
`Upon closer inspection, it looks like Mion brought her own vegetables and spices and other ingredients... they were spread all over the place!!`
`Mion... just for today... you brought all this stuff from your house!!!`
`"O-Objection!!!`
` Chie-sensei, there's no way this is allowed, is iiiit!?"`
`"Objection overruled.`
` As long as it makes for delicious curry anything goes☆."`
`Ugh. For that normally serious teacher to go so far as to append a star to the end of her sentence!!`
`Just as the rumors said... she's a through-and-through curry freak...`
`"Rena and Rika-chan are naturally-gifted chefs!`
` I've come with thorough preparations!!`
` ...And?`
` Kei-chan, what about you?`
` Hehehehe...!!"`
`...It's hopeless...`
` In the grand scheme of cooking... peeling the vegetables is only a small part of it.`
`...The hurdles I must overcome are just too numerous... and too high!!`
`"...Maebara-san, over here!"`
`Turning around, I saw the voices calling me belonged to the two underclassmen from earlier, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun.`
`"What's up, you guys?`
` ...Hmm?`
` What's up with that pot? Is that from your group?"`
`"Switch this with your pot before somebody notices.`
` ...I think that the curry the girls from our group made, at the very least, is better than what you could make."`
`...Y-You guys... ...for me...!?`
`"D-Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I-If you don't win then we.... that is..."`
`Oh, that's right.`
`If I don't win, then the talk of eating Satoko and Rika-chan's curry goes right out the window!!`
`It seems like... you guys are getting riled up about this too...!`
`"Sorry!!`
` I'm in your debt!!`
` ...But, I'm surprised the girls in your group agreed to this."`
`"Maebara-san.`
` ...We're also... serious about this!"`
`Filling in on day duty three times.`
` ...These guys... to assure me victory... have paid the price...!!!`
`That gaze filled with burning conviction from my underclassmen...!!`
`Yeah, I'm not fighting this alone.`
` ...I'm fighting this with everyone!!!`
`"Leave it to me!!!!`
` Save some room, boys.`
` I'll definitely let you eat your fill!!!"`
`""We shall be eagerly awaiting your victory!!""`
`It's a gas stove, so controlling the heat is easy.`
`All that's left is to let it stew a bit.`
` The delicious smell of curry began wafting upwards...`
`The pot gifted to me by my two underclassmen certainly drew some double-takes.`
`Rena even looked surprised when she came to take a look, so it must be pretty good.`
`"....Kei-chan, you're pretty good.`
` It look like this'll be a good match right to the bitter end!"`
`"Rena wants to eat Keiichi-kun's curry, curry!"`
`"Rena's curry and Mion's curry too... everybody is a worthy opponent.`
` I've done my very best... but I'm not sure of the outcome..."`
`"Keiichi-san, Rika's calling you.`
` Go see what she wants."`
`What?`
` Rika-chan's calling me?`
` What could it be?`
` ...Well, whatever.`
` ...While I'm at it I can gather some intelligence on the enemy.`
`Rika-chan was doodling on the ground in front of the pot.`
`...Because all that's left is to let it stew.`
` ...Even then, it's good to know that she doesn't leave the stove unattended.`
`"Hey Rika-chan, how's yours doing?"`
`"...It's Mr. Curry."`
`...Huh?`
` ...Rika-chan was doodling something strange, and introduced it as Mr. Curry.`
`"...Mr. Curry is amazing.`
` He shoots beams from his eyes.`
` ...Pew pew."`
`Apparently Mr. Curry shoots beams from his eyes.`
`Drawing a beam with a stick, she etched a line towards my feet.`
` ...Does this mean, I've been shot with a laser?`
`"Uwhoaaaaaa!!`
` Barrier!!`
` Beam Reflect!!!"`
`I took another stick in my hand, and reflected the beam, striking Mr. Curry!!`
`"Mr. Curry can shoot missiles from his stomach.`
` ...Psheewww."`
`"Hooowaaaahhh!!`
` Maebara Super Electromagnetic Barrier!!!`
` And Retaliatory Beam!!!"`
`"...Mr. Curry absorbs the beam energy and fires his Impulse Wave Cannon."`
`Rika-chan and I scratched at the ground, thoroughly engrossed in our doodle war.`
` ....Wait a moment.`
`"Hey, Rika-chan.`
` ...You called me here for a reason, right?"`
`"...Yes, I called you.`
` ...But I've already fulfilled my purpose."`
`At that moment, a chill ran up my spine.`
` ...Already fulfilled... her purpose!?`
`"They, they got me!!!!!!!"`
`Headed back to my pot... standing there, just as I feared, was Satoko!!!`
`With no questions asked, I dropkicked the back of her head!`
`"Wh-Wha-What do you think you're doing!!!`
` You know better than to do that to a lady's head!!!"`
`"Who cares about that!?`
` Satoko, did you mix something in with my curr—!!"`
`"How impertinent.`
` ...I haven't fallen that far.`
` ...Despite what you may think, I'm a fair person, you know."`
`"...Then what's this incomprehensible line of ladles and plates!?`
` Leaving them all in these unstable positions... if they fall over, what will you do!?"`
`At that moment, a gentle breeze blew by, knocking over a ladle that was stood up on its end.`
`The ladle, like a domino, fell over and knocked over the next cooking utensil in a row.`
`*whap whap whap whap*`
` *clank clank*`
` *thud thud*`
`"This is Art.`
` ...Come to think of it, domino world record challenges were quite the rage on television a while back."`
`"K-Kei-chan!!!`
` The frying pan!!!"`
`I didn't even have time to react.`
`...The chain reaction knocked over a cutting board...`
` ...Then a frying pan`
` ...`
` ...The next after that was...`
` My pot...`
`*CRASH*`
`The frypan struck my pot full-force, tipping it over!!`
`The contents cruelly spilled out... and now my masterpiece was being sampled by the schoolyard...`
`I stared, dumbfounded...`
`It was such a beautiful and elaborate mousetrap that for a moment, I lost touch with reality.`
`"Oh my oh my, this is a catastrophe~!`
` I didn't do anything, you hear me?`
` Ooohohohoho!!"`
`...At the very last moment... I had let my guard down...!!`
`I ignored the culinarily incompetent Satoko for far too long...!!`
`Even if she couldn't cook, Satoko still had this method of fighting back!`
`Just then, Rena, who had been sampling her own pot, let out a scream.`
`"Wh-Whaat!?!?!`
` Rena's curry is... salty? Salty!?"`
`Was Rena also sabotaged...!?`
` Then what about Mion...!?`
`"My rice is saltyyyy!!`
` I've been had!!"`
`"Ooohohohoho!!!`
` With this all the obstacles in my way have been taken care of before the fight even begins!!"`
`"...All that effort wasted.`
` So sad, so sad."`
`"So very very sad~"`
`Rika-chan and Satoko rubbed my dumbfounded head to their hearts' content...`
`Pushing the desks together, it was about time for the meals to be judged.`
`The delicious odor of curry spread throughout the courtyard...`
`The members of the Forestry Service, to whom we owed gratitude for their daily work, were guided to their seats.`
`The principal gave a bit of a ceremonial introduction. Next, the teacher expressed her desire for them to judge the curry contest.`
`The men from the Forestry Service seemed to like that kind of thing, and gave their enthusiastic approval.`
`"Well then, is everybody finished~?`
` We'll now have all the judges sample your cooking~!"`
`Everybody in the class brought up their painstakingly made curry and arranged them on the desk.`
`The only club members who managed a decent result were Rika-chan's group...`
`Knowing full-well it was a failure, Rena plated her curry for the judges.`
` She already knew she was going to get a low score.`
`But... at least she was still able to serve hers.`
`Both Mion's and my curry were completely obliterated, so we couldn't even line them up on the table...`
`The judges started from the curry made by the lower grades.`
`They had a lively discussion, praising the food.`
`Finally... it was our curry's turn.`
`"Next up is Ryuugu-kun's curry.`
` Yes.`
` ...This looks quite appetizing!!"`
`The principal cheerfully shoveled a spoonful of Rena's salty curry into his mouth...!!`
`Of course, his expression immediately changed.`
`"Oh my... what happened, Ryuugu-san?`
` It seemed so delicious when you were cooking it..."`
`Chie-sensei must have had some expectations, judging from her disappointment.`
`"Hau.... I-I'm sorry...`
` I might have added... a bag of salt by accident..."`
`The rest of the judges grimaced after they each had a bite.`
` ...I feel sorry for them.`
`"Failure is but the seasoning for success!!`
` I'm looking forward to next time!`
` Do your best!!"`
`Saying that, the principal devoured the rest of the oversalted curry in one go. Truly a man amongst men.`
`Rena was down and out.`
`Her offensive capabilities were something else, but she was defeated due to her weak defense.`
`"...Well then.`
` Please savor our curry next."`
`"I see that Furude-san's group put a lot of effort into their curry!`
` Let's see here.`
` ...Hmm.`
` It's simple, but very nicely done☆."`
`There was also the incident with Rena's salted curry right before this, so the judge's assessment was extraordinarily high...!`
`Maybe not just extraordinary... but perhaps today's forerunner?`
`The judges began a heated debate.`
`One of those judges let out a sigh as he removed a chunk of carrot with his spoon.`
`"Yeah, this kid's curry really isn't half bad...`
` ...but, I don't like carrots, you see."`
`Personally, I think that carrots are a staple of curry.`
` ...But I guess to each their own.`
`However, seeing that, Rika-chan read the nameplate on the chest of his coveralls, and began to speak.`
`"...That's no good, Kyouji.`
` You have to eat your carrots."`
`What is she saying all of a sudden...?`
` Everybody turned to Rika-chan with a stunned look.`
`But`
` ......`
` What Rika-chan just did...`
` Was super effective.`
`The carrot-hating judge began stuffing his face with curry while tears streamed down his face.`
`"......Kyouji.`
` There's seconds if you want them."`
`*sob* "MOMMMMMMYYYYYYYY!!"`
`While crying like that he continued to shovel curry into his mouth!`
`That's right.`
` ...Rika-chan's curry was by no means 'simple.'`
` No... that curry had the taste of a mother's cooking!`
`With the carrot-hating judge out of the picture, Rika-chan's assessment was unanimous.`
`"Ohoho.`
` Nobody can stand up to Rika's curry!!"`
`Satoko let off a shrill laugh as she declared victory, but at that moment...!`
`"Don't be fooled, my esteemed judges!!`
` Don't be deceived into thinking that this meager slop is the taste only a mother can provide!!`
` What you people actually wanted to eat... was this kind of curry, wasn't it!?"`
`Ooooooohhh!!!!`
`All of a sudden, in all its perfect glory... Mion's curry!`
`Not only the judges, but the teacher, the underclassmen, and of course myself... could only gasp in admiration!!`
`Hamburg steak with a demi-glace sauce, and a fresh salad...!!`
`It's a set!!`
`It wouldn't be stretching it to say that this was a full course meal!!`
` It's perfect... perfectly made!!!`
`"A-Amazing, amazing!!`
` Mii-chan, you're amazing!`
` Mii-chan, you're amazing!!!"`
`Satoko was also shocked.`
`Even Rika-chan couldn't hide her surprise.`
`It seems the victor was decided without even needing a taste.`
`Of course the hamburger was hand-kneaded.`
`The salad also had a homestyle dressing, but of professional quality.`
`And the curry, not even a micron of grit!!!`
`"This is sublime...`
` Truly a taste to savor, Sonozaki-san!`
`This curry is no doubt... a living testimony to 6000 years of Indian knowledge in beautiful harmony with Japanese cuisine...`
` ...I'm elated!`
` This deserves full marks!!`
` I'm giving it 100 points."`
`"Aww, you're welcome~.`
` I'm just trying to set an example as class representative."`
`Mion bowed politely.`
` ...And then winked at us with a smirk on her face!`
`"...I admit... defeat."`
`"T-There's no way this is happening...!!`
` I'm certain I sabotaged that pot of rice!!"`
`That's right.`
`Satoko had dumped salt into Mion's rice cooker, which should have ruined it!!!`
`At that moment, it hit me. I spun back towards my own canister.`
`...T-That's whHhyyyyYYYyyy!!`
`At some point, my cooking canister had been opened, its contents completely emptied.`
`"D-Damn you MioooooooOOooon!`
` You used my riiiIIiiiiiiiiiiice!!!`
` That's no faaaAAaaiiirr!!`
` Hand over half of your cuuuUUurry!!"`
`Mion clucked her tongue and waved her finger at me as a smirk washed over her face.`
`"Whoa there, Kei-chan, you're not taking this seriously enough.`
` You gave up at the last moment.`
` I didn't.`
` That's the difference between us.`
` As soon as you give up, it's all over!!"`
`Gah...!! I couldn't even properly voice my shame...!`
`"Mii-chan, I feel sorry for Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Just give him at least a little..."`
`"It's fine, it's fine.`
` This is a lesson.`
` Kei-chan just learned that you shouldn't give up on the contest until it's all over... right?"`
`It loathes me to say it but... Mion is right!`
`To give up so quickly on the match was my own folly...!!`
`For Mion to have brought that to my attention... I should actually be thankful to her...!`
`Well then... did that mean that even in this situation, I shouldn't give up!?`
`"My curry was overturned while it was still in the pot, and I don't even have any rice left...`
` How in the blazes am I not supposed to lose hope in this situation!?"`
`"Ma-Maebara-san......"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun suddenly appeared.`
`Dammit...!!`
`Even though my protégés had tried so hard...!!`
`I wasn't able to meet their expectations!!`
`"I-It was an accident.`
` ...There was nothing you could do."`
`Both of them were dejected...`
` Gah... I couldn't accept defeat so easily.`
` I was their senior!!`
` What would I be if I didn't pick up the broken pieces of the dream I had shown them!!`
`I just learned it from Mion just now, didn't I?`
` Don't throw away the contest!`
` Not until the last moment!`
`"Think, Keiichi Maebara!!`
` Think!!`
` Not about how to make more curry, about how to win the match...!!!`
` ......Hmmmm...`
` AaaaaAAaaaaAah!!!!"`
`I had an idea.`
`...I didn't think it could turn the tables, but it was better than nothing!`
`"Tomita-kun, come and wash your hands. Help me out!!`
` Okamura-kun, there's something I want you to find!!"`
`""Okay! Gotcha!!""`
`Both of them dispersed after receiving these instructions.`
`"...Oh?`
` How is Kei-chan going to flounder about at the end?`
` ...Why don't you show me?"`
`"Nobody likes a stubborn fool, you know~?"`
`"Shut up!`
` Just sit there and watch the last card I have to play!!`
` First off. Mion, I'll be taking some of your rice.`
` I won't let you say no!!"`
`"......I don't really care. It's salty, after all."`
`"It's okay if Rena helps too, right?`
` Keiichi-kun is in trouble right now."`
`"Hearing you say that is very reassuring!!!`
` Well then, Rena!`
` ......`
`Go make some tea."`
`"Hau.... he doesn't trust me."`
`"Next, Satoko!!`
` Also, Rika-chan!!`
` I challenge you to a side bet."`
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaAAaaay!?!?"`
`"....We'll listen to your request."`
`This was my duty to my two protégés who shed blood, sweat, and tears for my sake.`
`"Satoko, Rika-chan... If I receive a perfect score...!!`
` I'll be taking your curry.`
` Nothing for you to eaaaaAAAaat!!!"`
`"Y-You need to know when to stop joking around!!!`
` I'll be giving a big NO to that!!!"`
`"...No, it's all right, Satoko.`
` Take him up on it."`
`Firmly patting the top of Satoko's head, Mion said those words with all the gravitas of a Club President.`
`"You handicapped him this much, didn't you?`
` There's no way he can make up for that.`
` So meet him head on.`
` ...No matter how hard he struggles, he's not going to make a comeback.`
` Right?"`
`"Grrrr... Th-That may be true, but......"`
`"...I don't mind.`
` Keiichi. Go for it. Yaaay."`
`The judges, seemingly growing tired of sampling the various curries, were debating each entry.`
`...From what little I overheard, it seemed that Mion's impending victory was not in question...`
`"By the way... what happened to Maebara-kun's curry?`
` I still haven't tried it yet."`
`".........Yeah.`
` The pot with my curry in it...... fell over..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...Is that so?`
` That's a real shame!!"`
`"...I may have lost my curry... but that doesn't mean I've lost this contest.`
` ...I'll have everybody singing my praises!!"`
`My combative posturing had drawn the attention of all the judges...!!`
`"First of all, just be quiet and eat these, please.`
` ...I'll listen to your complaints after that!`
` ...This is... My cookiiiIIiiiiiing!!!!"`
`"...Ma-Maebara-kun... that's......?"`
`"Hmph...`
` Onigiri, huh."`
`The judges smiled wryly at the simple fare that was quite in contrast to the preceding bravado.`
`Rena poured tea into the cups she had brought over from the break room.`
`"He... he's making a mockery of this!!`
` There... look!`
` There's not even any filling... it's nothing more than salted onigiri!!!`
` This isn't even worthy of being called a contest anymore!!!"`
`"......It's true, the amount of salt might be a little much, but..."`
`Rena's expression told me that she thought this was a great idea, but it might still not be enough to win the match...`
`"Maebara-san, is this... really enough to make a comeback!?"`
`"Gentlemen.`
` You did well.`
` ...It's all right.`
` Just watch."`
`The judges were chewing with their mouths full and sipping at the tea.`
`...Nobody was singing praises or awestruck.`
`...They were just quietly ...chowing down.`
`"......It seems that Kei-chan... has learned how to use some rather underhanded tricks.`
` ...This... might be difficult."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ......Rena understands that now too."`
`"Wh-What do you mean!?`
` Why is everybody just quietly... eating that much!?"`
`"You see, Satoko-chan.`
` That's because the judges are actually..."`
`...tired of eating curry!`
`Because they were judges, they had to sample each and every offering.`
`And because they were from small children, because they were made to show their appreciation, they couldn't eat just a little bit of each.`
`"Sometimes a man values the amount more than the taste!!`
` At those times, rather than rich, mind-blowing flavor.... they crave simplicity!!"`
`They couldn't say it out loud, but this was the tastiest thing they'd had today...`
` I confirmed that by looking at their eyes as the judges smiled wryly.`
`"I'll praise your efforts, but... today's contest was about curry.`
` ...I'm not sure we can give a score to this."`
`The teacher and the principal had folded their arms while they pondered the situation.`
`My underlings, seeing that... saw the small glimmer of hope fade away, and grew dejected.`
`Argh, was this little surprise just not enough...?`
`"...Don't give up, Kei-chan."`
`Mion whispered quietly.`
` ......That's right.`
` If I didn't push here...!!!`
`"No.`
` I'll have you give it a score.`
`If you think that curry and onigiri are really that different, you're sorely mistaken."`
`"Huh?`
` Maebara-kun, what are you saying?`
` How are they the same!?"`
`The principal stopped the teacher.`
`It looked like he was giving me one final chance.`
`The judges, having eaten their fill, quietly waited for my statement...`
`"In its homeland of India, curry is usually eaten with a type of bread called 'naan,' isn't it?`
` Therefore, you could say that this cuisine we call curry rice, is something that we have adopted and modified.`
`Just as the teacher said at the beginning, it's a fusion of Indian and Japanese cuisine."`
`"I know what you're trying to say, Maebara-kun.`
` But what does that have to do with onigiri...?"`
`"It's actually very simple.`
` ...Both curry and onigiri...`
` are things made to let you enjoy eating rice!!!!"`
`Rice was introduced to Japan from ancient China.`
`...Our agricultural forebears watered the fields, fighting the elements, disease, and pests to grow and raise our rice-centric culture...!!!`
`Yes, the Japanese people have formulated a plethora of dishes, but those were nothing more than attempts to find ways to enjoy eating rice!!!`
` In other words...`
`"Curry and onigiri... are both the results of...`
` Rice Culture!!!!!"`
`It was scattered at first, but slowly grew into a steady roar...`
` It was a thunderous applause that praised me!`
`"Enough with the nonsense already!!!!`
` I won't accept this!!`
` The teachers are only judging curry, you know!`
` This is out of the question!`
` It obviously deserves 0 points!!!"`
`"M-Miss... Keiichi-kun did his best.`
` Could you please acknowledge that...?"`
`"...Today's class was supposed to be about curry...`
` What should we do?"`
`Mion, stifling her laughter, stepped forward.`
`But the chef didn't even give them a second glance."`
`"...I wonder why that was.`
` They were ingredients from his homeland."`
`"The chef went to the local fishmarket, and made a dish from fresh fish caught in Japan.`
`The culture of food isn't bound by predetermined rules.`
` ...It's culture. If you come to Japan, you meld with Japanese culture and make something new.`
`...That's how curry and onigiri are the same."`
`Mi-Mion...`
` She was providing fire support... I had to be grateful.`
`The judges were somehow moved by this complicated-yet-baseless trivia.`
`A stern look washed over the teacher's face as she refolded her arms.`
`"...Maebara-kun, your pot of curry was flipped over, wasn't it?`
` Even though I said at the beginning to be careful."`
`"I-I'm sorry..."`
`"But... as Maebara-kun and Sonozaki-san said, there are no boundaries in cuisine.`
` If it's something that can amaze people, then it's not something that should be discriminated against just because of the form."`
`"...Then? Then?"`
`"For spilling your pot, minus 20 points.`
` ...But, just for today...`
` For not giving up, and doing your best, plus 20 points.`
` I'll give you 100 points."`
`""Ma-Maebara-san!! We did iiiiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIiiit!!!""`
`My underclassmen leapt at me!!`
` A perfect score!!`
` We did it! We did it!!`
`The curry was spilt and our rice was taken...`
` But we made a comeback!!`
`In the end, Rika-chan's curry also received full marks, so everybody but Rena had a perfect score.`
`...Since this contest was outside the scope of regular club activities, there wasn't any particular penalty game.`
` Rena breathed a sigh of relief.`
`"Now then, as promised. Satoko. Rika-chan.`
` I'll be taking your curry."`
`"Bu-Bu-But that means we won't have any lunch~! Wahhh~~!!!"`
`Satoko stomped angrily at the ground in frustration, but the price of defeat was absolute.`
`"--Is what I wanted to say, but I'll show you some mercy.`
` You can eat half!!"`
`"...Thank you, Keiichi."`
`My two protégés peered over from the sidelines, tears of joy streaming from their faces. We exchanged glances that would only be understood amongst men.`
`We-We did it, Maebara-san!!`
`Aah, this is all thanks to you!!`
`We flashed each other a thumbs-up!`
`"Now... I just have to give these to my pupils.`
` I've gotten pretty hungry myself.`
` I guess I'll have one of my onigiri.`
` ......Wai— huh?"`
`There was no trace of my onigiri.`
`The ones I had set aside for myself included.`
`As I peered around searching for them, the principal clapped a hand on my shoulder.`
`"Gahahaha!!`
` When I was listening to that speech you gave, the rice I was chewing grew even more delicious!!`
` Gahahahaha!!!"`
`"Ummm... could it be... that you also ate my share...?"`
`"Gahahahahahaha!!!"`
`The principal simply laughed without answering...`
`Se-Seriously...?`
`My eyes half-brimming with tears and my stomach rumbling, I was called over by the teacher.`
`"Maebara-kun, because of the circumstances, I had to give you a perfect score, but...`
` You understand, right?"`
`"Huh? Understand... what?"`
`There was an odd glint in the teacher's eyes.`
`...If I had to describe it... it was curry-colored.`
`Like a pot of stewing curry, her eyes whirled around in a spiral.`
` A chill washed over me.`
`The teacher clutched me by the shoulders, and drew me in closer until our noses were almost touching.`
`"Curry is this world's most respected and sacred of dishes.`
` I will absolutely not allow it to be put in the same category as onigiri.`

`"...Hey, Keiichi-san!`
` What are you stumbling around for!!`
` Cleaning up is a part of cooking too!!"`
`"Keiichi-kun, your eyes are all curried!`
` Why is that? Why?"`
`Curry curry curry.`
` Hehehehe...♪`
`"Yikes... she got him, huh.`
` It's okay, he'll be back to normal by tomorrow.`
` Probably."`
`It wasn't that long before hunger brought me back to my senses.`
`In the end, all of the onigiri was eaten by the principal, so I had to make do without lunch.`
`Skipping lunch... I never knew the afternoon could be so long and painful...`
`A feeling other than drowsiness made me space out...`
`"A-Are you all right Keiichi-kun?`
` That's why I said you shouldn't eat Rena's curry."`
`As if I could eat this curry with enough salt in it to make my blood pressure rise just by looking at it!`
` Is what I said as I initially refused...`
`I could only regret it.`
` ...The hunger... The stomachache...`
`"Well well!`
` You did a good job making it through.`
` Your absolutely hopeless situation, that is!`
` Kei-chan, you're pretty strong when you're cornered, eh?"`
`"I don't need any compliments right now.`
` ...I need food~..."`
`"There's something for you to eat at home, right?"`
`"We don't keep snacks lying around at home.`
` And I'm out of cup noodles right now..."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Since you're enduring that hunger so much right now, I'm sure tonight's dinner will be really tasty."`
`I had absolutely no intention of laughing along.`
`"Well then, I'll take my leave.`
` I have my part-time job again today.`
` ...*sigh* It's really rough when you're not used to the work."`
`Ah, that job at that Angel Mort family restaurant huh.`
`...That uniform(?) was somewhat stimulating...☆ Hau~.`
`"...Being a waitress really is hard work."`
`"Eh? Mii-chan is working as a waitress?`
` Really!? Really!?`
` What kind of place is it!? Hau~~!!"`
`"N-No... I'm... right, I'm working at that toy store from the other day!!`
` Shion is the waitress..."`
`Ah, my bad.`
`I completely forgot that was how it ended up being...`
`"I-I'm sorry.`
` You guys look so similar I mixed you up."`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Who's Shion?"`
`Rena asked the obvious question.`
`"Ah, ummm... Mion's younger twin sister.`
` She's got a different personality, but she's a dead ringer for Mion."`
`"That's right!`
` We look similar, but our personalities are completely different!`
` I'm very kind and thoughtful, but Shion has a cold and scary personality...!"`
`"...I think that when you guys were born, Shion got all the feminine aspects.`
`Unlike Mion, she's a cute, cheerful girl."`
`"Ke-Ke-Kei-chaaaaAAaaan...!!!"`
`Rena interjected as her eyes darted back and forth from our exchange.`
`"...Hmmm?`
` Is that true?`
` Rena's never met her...`
` Mii-chan, did you ever tell me you had a younger sister?"`
`Shion's existence was already being exposed as a cover-up.`
`...I-I couldn't help Mion out here...`
` I could only have her end this charade.`
`"Oh yeah.`
` I still haven't introduced her to you, Rena.`
` Ahaha, my younger sister's name is Shion."`
`"I don't know.`
` I've never heard of her.`
` I never met her when I went to Mii-chan's house."`
`"Ummm... yeah, that!`
` You know, I'm the only one that lives with granny.`
` Shion lives at the family home in Okinomiya.`
` We-We're not that close... so yeah, she doesn't come here too often~!"`
`"Hmmm..."`
`Rena's face indicated she wasn't sure if she was convinced.`
`She was usually a bit of an airhead, but she was unusually sharp when it came to these kinds of things...`
`"Ummm... well, ...it's not a lie. Please believe me."`
`As she said "Yeah, I believe you," a smile suddenly blossomed on Rena's face.`
`"Rena wants to meet her~!`
` I'll go and see her some time!`
` What store is she working at!? What store!?"`
`"Umm... ahh... that is..."`
`...Aaahh, she's getting more tangled in her little web.`
` I could tell that Mion was getting increasingly frantic.`
`...I wanted to help her out, but it was hard for an outsider to butt in on family issues...`
`"Ah, ah! Sorry!!`
` I have to get to work!!`
` Later!`
` Rena, Kei-chan!`
` See you tomorrow~!!"`
`Unilaterally ending the conversation, Mion headed home...`
`No matter how you looked at it, she was running away...`
` We'll just label this one as an emergency escape.`
`"Mii-chan was kinda cute.`
` I wonder why, I wonder why.`
` Hehe...!"`
`Rena giggled in amusement.`
`I wonder when dinner is...`
` Would lying down be the best way to conserve energy?`
`I sprawled in the entryway without even taking off my shoes.`
`As I was losing the last vestiges of my consciousness, the doorbell rang.`
` It seemed I had a guest.`
`"Come on in~.`
` It's open..."`
`I directed my listless voice at the door.`
`"...G-Good afternoon... huh!?`
` Kei-chan, what're you doing!?"`
`It seemed my guest was Mion, or rather, Shion.`
`She seemed shocked when she saw me sprawled out in the entryway.`
`"I-Is that Shion..!?`
` Wait... why..."`
`I thought that Shion's existence was an illusion that was limited to when Mion was at the restaurant.`
`That's why I never even considered that Shion would appear here.`
`"I heard from my sister.`
` Because of club activities today, you weren't able to eat lunch, right?"`
`"Yeah, it was a lot of trouble.`
` Satoko spilled my pot, and you stole my rice..."`
`"Bu-But I'm... Shion..."`
`She grew red and began to mope.`
` ...That's right, she was the younger twin right now.`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` ...What's up?`
` Did you bring something for me to eat?"`
`"Oh my...`
` ...It's somehow disappointing that you hit the nail right on the head, but here."`
`With a disappointed smile, Shion held out the small bento box she had hidden behind her back.`
`"Huh!?`
` Y-You really brought something to eat!?`
` Th-Thanks!"`
`"There was still some of the ground beef left over from what my sister brought to school.`
` I knew it was going to be right before dinner... but I wondered if you'd want it.`
` Am I bothering you?"`
`"N-Not even a bit...!`
` I'm really happy!!`
` Can I really eat this!?"`
`Sneaking a look inside the box, to say that she just put some of the leftovers inside would have been a lie. There was an elegant meal stuffed inside.`
`"I-Is it really okay!?`
` There's not like a ton of hot sauce mixed in or anything, right!?"`
`"Geez.`
` I'm not my sister. I wouldn't do that kind of thing.`
` If you don't like it you don't have to force yourself...`
` I'll just go home and eat it myself."`
`Saying that, she pouted cutely and made a motion as if to snatch the box back.`
`...There were some times that made me doubt that she was the same person as Mion, and this was undoubtedly one of those moments.`
`"I-I don't mind at all.`
` I want to chow down on it with thanks from the bottom of my heart...!"`
`"I-It's... not something to be so thankful about that your nose has to run..."`
`Shion, who had thought that I might not take the bento, looked down happily.`
`"Th-There's not much, but do you want to come in...?`
` I can probably make some tea or something..."`
`"...Ahh... sorry, maybe some other time.`
` I'm on my way to work."`
`Oh, that's right.`
` She did say that before...`
`"Just rinse the box out with water and give it back to my sister tomorrow, please."`
`"O-Of course!`
` It would only be the proper thing to do after being allowed to eat something that looks this delicious!"`
`"Well then, I'll take my leave.`
` .........Ah...`
` ...One last thing..."`
`Shion grew red again as she looked down once more.`
`"...During that contest with the curry, my sister took your rice without permission, right?`
` ...My sister fools around too much, so sometimes she gets carried away.`
` She wasn't doing it just to be mean..."`
`"Hey, hey.`
` It's not like I mind that too much.`
` There are no grudges when it comes to club activities, after all!`
`In fact, I should be the one that's thankful for all the thrills and entertainment!`
` ...`
`Could you tell that to Mion for me?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...I think`
` ...my sister will be very happy to hear that.`
` Well then, I have to go...!"`
`Shion smiled brightly.`
`After bowing deeply, she left as she looked at her watch.`
`"...I'm happy... but... is this really okay?"`
`I looked at the bento box that she left behind.`
`A faint warmth spread through the palm of my hand.`
`If it were Mion... I could see hot sauce, mustard, maybe even a needle being mixed inside. (But really, I don't think she would go so far as putting a needle in there...)`
`I opened the box once again, and hesitantly tasted a bit.`
`...I took a bite.`
` And another.`
`...There was no funny business.`
`...There was no danger at all, for it was delicious.`
`That's right.`
` That was Shion, not Mion. So there shouldn't have been anything to worry about.`
`I rushed back to my room, eating as I gave my thanks.`
`...It was so delicious that my stomach could cry.`
`"...Shion,`
` ...No... Mion,`
` when she heard I was so hungry I could die, she brought this over to me."`
`It was delicious to the last bite.`
` ...By the way, nothing strange had been mixed in.`
`I was a bit embarrassed at myself for being so skeptical.`
