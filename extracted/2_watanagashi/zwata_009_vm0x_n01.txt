`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And well... things dragged on a while."`
`Things dragged on?`
`So, you mean to say...`
` ...You didn't have a cold or anything...`
`"So you really are just tired?!`
` If you were up all night, just say so! That was confusing..."`
`...I suppose she'd be feeling lousy either way.`
` Still, you treat colds and sleep deprivation in completely different ways.`
`...She didn't seem to be feeling well, but now that I knew the cause, I didn't need to worry too much.`
` It would go away with a little rest, after all.`
`...The older sister shattered from an all nighter, but the younger seemed fine.`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be catching up on your sleep today, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` Is Mion playing truant today?`
` Ah-hahahaha! That's so like her~~!"`
`Shion seemed a little unsteady too.`
` ...She was up all night with Mion, wasn't she?`
`"The Sonozakis are a syndicate with this entire region under their thumb.`
` Incidentally, her father is a high-ranked executive in a syndicate association that's well known even in the Kanto region. `
`It's the very picture of a gang boss's house, protected by high walls, barbed-wire fence, and security cameras.`
` If you have the chance, you should go and visit her."`
`"No, no, no, no, no.`
` Not at all, not at all.`
` A boring old syndicate isn't the only thing Mion Sonozaki-san will inherit.`
` She's inheriting the Sonozaki family itself. `
`She'd mentioned Mion being a successor...... but... to a crime syndicate...?`
`"...Mion, how is your cold doing?`
