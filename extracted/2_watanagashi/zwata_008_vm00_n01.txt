`Huh? The bedridden old man from the Kimiyoshi branch family is here too!`
` I think that old guy went home from Watanagashi last year and stayed in bed ever since."`
`"Now, it's time for the Hinamizawa Michelin, Judge Satoko Houjou, to give her impressions!"`
`"......You would go over well at the entrance of Akihabara Station."`
`"...Rika, I have never heard of this 'Akihabara.' Where is it?"`
`"Keiichi-kun, you're a pervert... Your nose is bleeding..."`
`"......What about my flat chest?"`
`(We're right at the scene of a rendezvous, of course~.`
` See, look closely.`
` Can you tell who they are?)`
`"What's this...? Keiichi-kun, you sure are smart, you know that?`
` Having a secret date in a place like this?`
` Then I guess we accidentally interrupted something important. A-ha-ha-ha!!"`
`You're the ones who were meeting up secretly!!`
`"Wait, so you two weren't having a little rendezvous, then?"`
`"Heehee...`
` Unfortunately, this wasn't the location of a rendezvous either of you would want to see.`
` Sorry for not living up to your expectations."`
`"Hmm.`
` If this wasn't a rendezvous, then what were you doing?`
` Tomitake-san, were you messing around with the padlock on the door just now?"`
