`"I'm back!!"`
`"How did it go?`
` Did you find any clues?"`
`...The officers shook their heads in disappointment.`
`Exhaustion was plainly showing on everyone's faces.`
`That was only natural.`
` None of them had gotten a wink of sleep since the day of Watanagashi.`
`"Chief.`
` Let the youngest of us take a nap, and then switch them out.`
` We've got a long stretch ahead of us, after all.`
` Let's not push ourselves too hard—rest up so we can take it easy as we go."`
`"I've been telling them to sleep in shifts.`
` Nobody actually seems willing to sleep, though.`
` ...Could you tell them yourself, Ooishi-san?"`
`"Oh my.`
` You don't need to force yourselves.`
` Komiyama-kun.`
` Please let everyone sleep in shifts, starting with the youngest."`
`"Komiyama-san.`
` Please do that."`
`After the chief told him as well, Komiyama-san left his seat.`
`"So, Chief.`
` Still no good on our request?"`
`"...It's just a rumor among the villagers in the first place, you know?`
` It's going to be difficult without more concrete evidence."`
`"Even when that evidence might be tucked away in there?"`
`"We need evidence that evidence is tucked away in there...!"`
`"Chief~`
` Don't start speaking in riddles to me, now.`
` We have witnesses that say four people, including the two who died, went into the forbidden ritual storehouse without permission! `
`This is all reliable information."`
`"You might call it information, but they're really only rumors. They're not concrete evidence."`
`"Well, it's true that we don't have any pictures of the four of them sneaking in with cloth tied around their heads. `
`Anyway, those four saw something inside the storehouse!`
` Something important enough that they'd be erased!"`
`"Important enough that they'd be erased? What would that be, exactly?"`
`...That's why I'm asking for a warrant to go looking for it in the first place...!`
`"...Look, Ooishi-san, I know how you feel!`
` However, that storehouse is a sacred building belonging to the Furude Shrine, and we need to have proper consideration for the locals when dealing with it."`
`I heard that there was an hour long call made from Congressman Sonozaki to the big man.`
` ...Chief, could he have nailed you back down?`
`"Anyway!`
` As long as we don't have suitable evidence, we won't get a search warrant for the storehouse.`
` That goes for the Sonozaki main house, too! `
`Especially considering that's the jurisdiction of both Section 4 and the prefectural police's crime prevention division.`
` We need careful preparations first!"`
`"...If you say you need preparations, then why don't you just let me talk with them directly?`
` Shige-chan is the head of Section 4, right?`
` For crime prevention, it's Sankai-san. `
`They seem like they'd be quicker to talk if I sat them down at a mahjong table."`
`"C-Chief, you have a visitor...!`
` Um... yikes!"`
`Pushing the employee who guided him in right out of the way was an old man who looked like a yakuza member, given his crested kimono and hakama.`
` ...Did he not get enough of this over the phone?`
`"I am Congressman Sonozaki!!`
` I demand to know who's responsible for this!!!`
` This instant!!"`
`"H-Hello...!`
` I am the division chief, Takasugi!!"`
`"I don't need YOUR name!!`
` I could have you demoted on a whim!`
` You wouldn't even be enough!`
` Bring out the one called Ooishi or whatever!! `
`He deserves punishment for requesting a search warrant on the sacred Furude Shrine!!!"`
`"I-I sincerely apologize...!`
` O-Ooishi is currently out on investigation, and he's been difficult to contact... I'll take his place and hear you out...!`
` S-So please, have a seat!"`
`The chief's eyes were telling me to get out of here.`
`...Perhaps I'll gratefully accept this favor...`
` Maybe I'll go lay down in the nap room.`
`"Listen here!! The Furude Shrine spent 2600 years under the imperial calendar and 2500 more beyond that! It is sacred! A sanctuary that must never be defiled!! `
`The eight hundred thousand gods, Oyashiro-sama, and the spirits of our ancestors are enshrined there.`
` The holy shrine protects Hinamizawa from when the sun comes up to when it sets, and from when the moon rises to when it falls. `
`Who is the idiot who wanted to set foot in there?!?!`
`Besides, the right to religion is the most revered right of the people of this country in the constitution!!!`
` You dare to be so bold as to sully that using your own investigation's negligence as pretext!!? `
`I cannot—I will not allow it!!!`
` Are you listening, you lying scum?!`
` I'm angry now, so you're not getting off the hook that easily!!!"`
