`"I wonder why afternoons always make you feel sleepy like this."`
`Mion spoke in a voice that went so far as to make whoever heard it lethargic.`
`"You want a medical explanation for sleepiness?`
` I could say it, but it'll just make you more sleepy."`
`"...Gah~ ...Spare me~..."`
`It was almost 3 o'clock.`
`6th period was almost over.`
`By the way, Satoko and everyone else in the lower grades ended their school day after 5th period, so they were probably running around in the schoolyard right now.`
`I could hear their joy-filled voices coming from there right now. Oh, what I would give to be able to join them.`
`"Mii-chan, you're the class representative, so you have to try harder.`
` No going to sleep~."`
`"You see, rather than the class representative, I'd rather be the president of the boxing club.`
` They get to sleep a lot."`
`"Huh? ...What makes you think that?"`
`"At the boxing gym they're always hitting the sack. Get it?"`
`BAM!`
`The teacher cackled as she hit the back of Mion's head with the corner of a textbook.`
`"...That's all from me.`
` I'll leave it at that for today.`
` Representative, please direct the class."`
`"Everybody stand up!`
` At attention!!"`
`Mion, who had been half-asleep, became lively again the moment she heard class was over.`
`...It must be delightful to be that shrewd.`
`Homeroom was done after the lower grades had finished their lessons, so we were free to go.`
`It was one of the odd rules we had as a mixed-grade school.`
`When they knew class was over, Satoko and Rika-chan returned to the classroom.`
`"...Good work today."`
`"All right!! It's time for happy fun club activities!!"`
`"Yeah!`
` That's right.`
` What should we do today?"`
`"Hey, Mii-chan.`
` Why don't we continue what we started yesterday?"`
`"Yes!`
` We should do that!`
` To have it end like that when things were getting good, I won't accept it!"`
`"Now now.`
` I know how you feel, but let's save that for another time!`
` Something like that shouldn't be done somewhere dinky like a classroom after school, but a grander stage!"`
`"I'm down whenever.`
` But some of the younger guys said they'd watch me in the finals.`
` So let me know ahead of time."`
`"Whoa!`
` Keiichi-kun, you're amazing!`
` There's people cheering you on! Cheering you on!`
` ...I wonder if there's anybody cheering on Rena..."`
`I couldn't help but watch as Rena entered her Pining Maiden Mode.`
`"I'm not gonna pull any punches, but I'll pray for your victory, Rena."`
`With a saccharine Keiichi-brand smile, I ruffled Rena's hair roughly.`
`"Wha!?`
` Hau~~~!?!?`
` ...Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke...`
` Keiichi-kun,`
` what.. are you... hau~~..."`
`Rena turned bright red and short-circuited, smoke billowing from both her ears.`
`Gazing into her eyes, a strange scene of me holding hands with Rena and skipping through a flowerbed was reflected there...`
`...Ahh... even if it was in somebody else's imagination, it was terribly troubling...`
`"...Meet Keiichi, the Rena-killer."`
`When Rika-chan said that, everyone burst out laughing at once.`
`"Ahahaha!`
` That Rena is a Satoko and Rika-chan killer, though!"`
`"It may be true that we can't win against Rena... but we won't lose to Keiichi!!"`
`"Oh~ This is becoming a pretty interesting relationship map.`
` Our strengths kind of interact like in rock-paper-scissors!`
` ...But that doesn't include Mion, does it?"`
`"Of course not.`
` It doesn't matter who it is, I won't lose."`
`Mion leered with the gaze befitting of a club president— no... befitting of an empress!`
`The mood in the room became more lively.`
` It was as good a moment as any to get started!`
`"Well now!`
` Let's get started nice and easy!"`
`"Yeah!`
` So then Mii-chan, what shall we do today? Today?"`
`Mion let out a small interjection as she rummaged through the so-called "Club Locker."`
`Every time I look... there's always a ton of things crammed in there.`
`Everything that's jammed in that locker is a game of some kind, you know?`
`On top of that, things used for penalty games like cat-ears and collars were kept in there... the capacity of that thing is unfathomable!`
`...That locker, maybe it actually extended through the wall into the 4th dimension... that's my theory, anyways.`
`If not that, then how else could you explain how someone could pull out item after item!?`
`After Mion touched her hand to her chin briefly in thought, she turned around without pulling out any games.`
`"Why don't we try and keep it a bit simple today?`
` Playing games that require lots of pieces all the time can be a little bland, right?"`
`"...It doesn't matter what game it is, if everybody plays together we can have fun."`
`"Yeah. That's right. That's right!"`
`Rena and I both expressed our agreement.`
` ...I feel the same way.`
`With this group, there's no doubt even if we were pulling weeds from the school grounds it would be fun.`
`"...That wouldn't be fun for me.`
` Pulling weeds or whatever."`
`"Ah, that's right, isn't it?`
` ...By the way, Satoko.`
` Could you stop reading people's minds by looking at their expressions?"`
`"Whatever you're thinking is always written all over your face.`
` So I always know right away~."`
`I've always been told that, but ever since I transferred it seems like it's been especially bad...`
`I need to develop a poker face or I could be in for a rough time...`
`We all immediately cut the idle chatter and put on stern expressions.`
`In no time at all, everybody's gaze focused like a tiger or a shark, listening intently.`
`That's right.`
` From the point where the rules are explained... the match has already begun!`
`"Today's game is... probably better known as a party game.`
` It's called 'Sympathy.' Has anybody heard of it before?"`
`...Sympathy.`
`It means to share someone's feelings, right?`
` ...Huh? Maybe I might know this...`
`"Mii-chan, maybe it's...`
` The game where we choose a topic, and everybody writes down the first word that comes to mind...`
` And the more people who share the same answers, the more points are awarded? `
`In that case, Rena knows about it!"`
`Ahh... I remember!`
`I recall playing a game like that in grade school while we were on the bus during a field trip!`
`"I'm not familiar with this game.`
` I would like an explanation."`
`"First of all, we have the leader choose a topic.`
` For example... if they choose 'dessert.'"`
`"Hehehe!`
` Satoko-chan, when somebody says 'dessert,' what's the first thing you think of?"`
`"...Ummm.`
` ...Let's see here...`
` 'Pudding' or something."`
`"Ok! In that case, Satoko, you would write down 'pudding' on your memo pad.`
` Then, everybody reveals their answer at the same time.`
` If there's two or more people who wrote down 'pudding,' they get points!`
`The more people who write down the same answer, the more points are awarded. So if everybody writes down the same answer, that's a max of 5 points!"`
`"...In other words, the trick is to think so that what you write down is the same answer as everybody else."`
`It was exactly as Rika-chan said.`
`The point of this game was to think in a way so that you have the same answer as everybody else.`
`For example... even if you heard the word 'dessert' and immediately thought of 'strawberry sundae'...`
` ...If your answer doesn't match up with everybody else you don't get any points.`
`That's why you have to hold off on that answer, and change to one that seems like one everybody else will choose...`
`The key becomes not what you think yourself, but being able to predict what everybody else will answer. It's a very high-level intellectual game!!`
`"...Mii, for Satoko's sake, let's try practicing for one round."`
`"OK~. For this round, seeing as I'm club president, the leader will be me, alright?`
` The topic can be something random..."`
`Taking out her literature textbook, she began flipping to a random page.`
`"Alright then... this is the only practice round!`
` ...The first topic is...`
` 'Shaved Ice'!!!"`
`"Ahahaha!`
` When you say 'shaved ice'... there's only one answer, isn't there~!"`
`Among the standard flavors of shaved ice, there's strawberry, melon, and Blue Hawaii.`
`The most popular amongst those... is obviously melon!`
`"Everyone wrote down an answer?`
` Then everybody show theirs at the same time, okay?`
` Ready... go!"`
`"Strawberry." "Melon." "Ujigintoki." "Strawberry." "Strawberry."`
`Wha—!?!? I'm the only one.. with melon!?`
`"Y-You guys...!`
` Don't go doing something so mundane as picking strawberry as the standard!`
`Hey Rena, would you actually order strawberry shaved ice!?`
` The first thing that always sells out at summer festivals is always melon, isn't it!?!?"`
`"Rena also likes melon flavor!`
` But really... it's all about the strawberry, right? Right☆!"`
`"Kei-chan, if I was to pick, I would actually choose melon.`
` But you see, this is a word association game.`
` If somebody says shaved ice the first thing you think of is strawberry!"`
`I'm still not entirely convinced... but in any case! It's this type of game!!`
`"R-Rika, what exactly did you write?`
` Is that a type of shaved ice??"`
`"...It's ujigintoki.`
` It's incredibly delicious, you know."`
`Well, it might be delicious, sure... but it's not exactly run-of-the-mill.`
` ..Still... that's a pretty refined choice...`
`"Satoko, did this help you get a good idea?`
` There were 3 people who wrote down strawberry, so those people get 3 points!`
` We compete to see who can get the most!"`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` I've got it!!`
` More importantly, Mion-san.`
` What shall we do about today's penalty game!?"`
`"Hau...!`
` Th-There's going to be one after all...`
` ...What will it be? ...What will it be!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` What should it be?`
` ...Kei-chan, you have a suggestion?"`
`"Wha- for the penalty game??"`
`"In other words, that thing where the loser has to carry around everybody else's baggage.`
` It happened often to the boys.`
` Elementary school kids walking around completely covered in backpacks, you see it a lot~!"`
`"But... how will we do that?`
` Satoko-chan and Rika-chan's houses are the complete opposite direction from ours."`
`"Then how about... the loser carries just the winner's stuff to their house?`
` Getting everybody's stuff to their house would involve covering a pretty sizable distance."`
`"Oh, yeah.`
` Just that much... might be alright!"`
`"...Somehow, today's penalty game is pretty simple.`
` With a penalty game of this level it wouldn't even be fun to make Keiichi-san do it!!"`
`"Then shall we raise the stakes a bit!`
` Not just playing porter...`
` ...`
` Tadaa!`
` How about we have someone schlep stuff around dressed in this!?"`
`"Wh-Wh—!!!`
` Why a maid outfit of all things!?!?"`
`"H-Hau...!`
` I-It's cute and all... b-but no waaaaaaaaaaaay~!!!!"`
`"...But you see, you see!`
` What do we do if Keiichi-san loses?`
` If we don't have a size that fits him..."`
`"Oh I didn't let that little detail get by~!`
` I have a nice XL size one prepared juuust for Kei-chan!!`
`So, Kei-chan, are you ready!?`
` I'm going to have you walk around outside dressed up as a maid~!!!`
`"T-T-This is insane!! Why do you have every possible size of that type of thing in that locker!?"`
`Th-This is bad, Keiichi Maebara!!`
`Somehow... it's become a situation where only my failure results in an overly cruel price to pay.`
`What if I make a mistake and lose...!?`
`I wouldn't be able to walk around in broad daylight anymore!!`
`Oh, Ma'am, about that Maebara boy...`
` Did you hear about him?`
` It seems like he has a penchant for cross-dressing.`
`Oh my, really?`
` That'd be so embarrassing, you know? Ooohohoho!!`
`"Ngyaaaa----!!!`
` Th-That's way too harsh!!!!!"`
`That's just incredibly... brutal!!`
` If we're to return this penalty to some semblance of normalcy, now is the only time!`
`E-Everybody, I think we should refrain from this unwholesome penalty game...!!!`
`Why on the way back home from school!?`
` Do we have to be accompanied by a girl wearing a maid uniform and carrying our baggage!?`
`Having them say "Master,"`
` while dragging them around the village in such an embarrassing outfit...`
` ...*pant pant*`
` ...Wait, why am I panting?`
`...Wh-What is this...`
` This feeling welling up inside me...`
`"Hey, let's just make it a normal penalty game...!`
` Wait, Keiichi-kun has frozen stiff..."`
`*FOOOOOM*!!!`
`Burning with passion, I firmly placed my hands on Rena's shoulders!!!`
`"Rena, there is no problem with the penalty game.`
` ...I just have to win!!`
` That's right, everybody!!!"`
`I turned to everybody with an idiotic grin, my pearly whites flashing with a brilliant gleam.`
`"Oh, Kei-chan, you've come around to the idea, eh?"`
`"No matter what the penalty game is, there's no reason to be afraid!!`
` You just have to win!!`
` Right, everybody!?`
` Yeah! Yeah!"`
`"""Yeaaaaaaaaah—!!!"""`
`From Mion to Rika, everybody energetically thrust their fists up high!!`
`Only Rena seemed somewhat undecided, standing there looking flustered.`
`...She's a little bit slow, isn't she. If she wins, even for Rena it's quite a delectable opportunity!`
`"Hey, Rena.`
` Don't you see this is a pretty big opportunity!?`
` ...Rika-chan or Satoko-chan in a maid outfit, coming right to your doorstep. This is a historically great chance, isn't it!?"`
`*sploosh*`
`Rena began spouting a fountain of blood from her nose.`
`The look in her eyes completely changed... she's shifted into Kyute Mode!`
`I was waiting for this Rena!!`
` That look in her eyes!!`
`"Hau~~~, to my doorstep~!!!`
` It's not like Keiichi-kun or Mii-chan wouldn't be good too~! Hau!"`
`"Alright!!`
` It looks like everybody's prepared themselves!!`
` Get your memo pads ready!!`
` First question, ready!?"`
`Mion opened up her textbook to a random page, and read out a word that caught her eye!`
`"The first topic is...`
` 'Summer Break'!!"`
`This is yet another... quite abstract keyword.`
`...Well then, let's not worry about it too much and start with something like this.`
`"Everybody good!?`
` Time to show 'em!`
` Ready, go!!!"`
`On Mion's signal, everybody simultaneously held up what they wrote.`
`Let's see, what did everybody write?`
`"Summer Festival." "Summer Festival." "Fireworks." "Mosquito Coils."`
`"Oh, Rena and I have the same answer!`
` Alright! Two points!"`
`"But Satoko's 'Fireworks' was pretty good too.`
` Rika's 'Mosquito Coil' is a very nice seasonal choice as well."`
`"...All the choices are quite invigorating."`
`"It's almost summer break, isn't it.`
` ...I wonder how we'll spend it this year."`
`Invigorating words that invoke the image of summer break.`
` Certainly things that enrich the soul.`
`As everybody approaches the soon-to-come summer break... a plethora of dreams should be etched upon their thoughts...`
`"...By the way... Keiichi-san, what did you answer?`
` Hurry up and show us."`
`"Ah.... I di-didn't really write down anything that great..."`
`"No no no!`
` Showing us is part of the rules!! Now come on!"`
`"Ah... stop it!`
` D-Don't look!!!"`
`"Homework."`
`The room went silent.`
`...Nobody could really follow up that response.`
`It's as if my impertinent answer had somehow sullied the wonderful dreams of the coming summer break...`
`"Keiichi-kun's summer breaks...`
` ...`
`were never fun, were they..."`
`"...It's alright.`
` Let's spend the summer this year with everybody.`
` ...We won't leave you by your lonesome."`
`Rika-chan gently petted my head.`
`Wh-what exactly did summer break mean to me...`
`...Summer courses.`
`Observing sunflowers.`
`Practice exams.`
`Special summer focus seminars.`
`...I know nothing of hot summers.`
` Because I've always been in an air-conditioned cram school...`
`...Ugh... the tears... they...`
`"...Kei-chan's summer breaks were always devoid of hopes and dreams, weren't they..."`
`"Wa... WaaaaAAaaaaAaaaaaaaAAAaaaaa!!!`
` Don't look at me with such pity in your eyes! Don't look at meeeheeeeheeeeeeeeeEEEeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`...This game called 'Sympathy' may be more terrifying than I could ever imagine...`
`"Well, anyhoo!`
` Rena and I get 2 points each!!`
` Let's keep going!! ...Next is...`
` 'Fish'!!!"`
`So, it's "Fish"!`
` Come to think about it, I haven't eaten sushi in a while.`
`By the way, rather than lean tuna, I'm quite the connoisseur on things like flounder!`
`...I wonder who I'll match with this answer.`
`Because for a Japanese person, anyone would think of this.`
`"Alright, everybody!`
` This time we'll start from mine!!`
` Ready, go!!"`
`"Sushi."`
`How about that for an answer!`
`When you see a lively fish, do you want to steam it or grill it?`
`No, to have fresh sashimi is the epitome of cuisine!`
`Rather than write "sashimi," however, I'll choose the more amiable term in "sushi" - That is my cunning ploy!!`
`...But contrary to the intrepid resolve of my reply, everybody's expression was listless.`
`"Oh. That's right...`
` When you say 'Fish'... ...I see.`
` ...Sushi is tasty, isn't it."`
`"Wa-aaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Stop talking to me in that consoling tone! Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"Well then, should the rest of us show our answers?`
` Ready, go!"`
`"Dolphin."`
`" Whale."`
`" Aquarium."`
`" Aquarium."`
`"Rika and I have the same answer!`
` That's 2 points!!"`
`"Rena picked whale, eh?`
` I thought about that too,`
` but I ended up picking dolphin."`
`"Ah, really!?`
` Rena wanted to write dolphin at first... but Rena didn't think anybody else would write it..."`
`"...Either one of them is very kyute."`
`Everybody, excluding me, stopped and stared blankly as their thoughts drifted over the horizon. It seems as if they can hear the roar of the open sea from over there...`
`"This means everybody has 2 points!`
` Well... everybody but Keiichi-san!"`
`"...Keiichi-kun's answers...`
` were worth 0 points,`
` ...but Rena thinks they were very unique and interesting! Interesting!"`
`"To immediately think of food when you hear the word fish.`
` ...Kei-chan, you should really be ashamed of how destitute your soul is, huh."`
`"WaaaAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAaaaaa!!`
` Don't say something like my soul is destituuuuuuuuUUuuuuuuuuuute!!`
` Besides, what's with Mion and Rena's answers, anyways!`
` Those aren't even fish!`
` Those are mammals!!"`
`"Objection overruled!!`
` Next!!"`
`Wh-What a horrid game this is today!!`
`As the games pile on and on, it seems as if I will be further exposed as a petty human being!!`
`I'm the only one who still hasn't earned any points!!`
` I want to at least get a point in the next round!!`
`"Alright, the next topic is...`
` 'Sakura'!"`
`Dammit!!`
` This time I'll do it!!`
`Keep your cool, Keiichi Maebara!`
`Don't think what you would normally think!`
`Everybody else here is a girl!`
`Stop thinking like a man!!`
`If you write down "Sakura Mochi" here you'll only be repeating the tragedies of the past!`
`Throw away that gastrocentric male sensibility!`
`Just for now think of yourself as a girl!`
`You are a girl...`
` You are a girl...`
` I am a girl...!!!`
`"Everybody finished writing!?`
` Let's do it!!"`
`"Keiichi-san, if you don't start getting points right now, won't it be a bit dangerous~?"`
`Hmph!`
` This time it's perfect.`
` I've completely suppressed my own instincts.`
`This time... I will have a match!`
` No, I will *make* it match!!!`
`"Keiichi-kun, you seem pretty confident about this one!`
` You see this time, Rena thought like a boy so I could match up with your answer.`
` Ehehe~... 'Sakura Mochi'☆"`
`"... I like them too.`
` I wrote it down."`
`Rena and Rika giggled together.`
`"WhooOOOOOooooaaaaaaahh!!`
` Now is not the time to think with your stomach!!"`
`"Well then, did Keiichi-san write the same answer as me? I put down 'Hanami'!"`
`"That's riiiight!`
` When you say 'Sakura' it just has to be 'Hanami,' yeah?`
` I wrote that down too!"`
`Mion and Satoko's response was 'Hanami'!`
` 'Hanami,' seriously!?!?`
`"Th-Th-That's the kind of event where old geezers getting drunk and doing all sorts of depraved things is the standard, isn't iiiiiiitttt!!!`
`And why of all times did you just decide to abandon answering from a girl's point of view!!"`
`"Well then, Kei-chan.`
` ...What sort of girly response did YOU write down?"`
`"I-I-It's nothing!!`
` Let's move on to this next topic, moving o-- ...Ah."`
`Before I knew it, Rika-chan had circled behind me and was intently reading the memo I had hidden behind my back.`
`It became dead quiet.`
`The abrupt silence enveloped the room.`
`It would be fine if somebody at least laughed at me or played it off as something dumb... but nobody even flinched.`
`The feeling in the pit of my stomach reached critical mass, causing my once blood-drained face to flush with a sudden wave of heat.`
`*poomph*`
`Mion quietly put her hand on my shoulder.`
`"Kei-chan.`
` ...Now I am certain.`
` ...Kei-chan, you are to your very core...`
` A geezer.`
` Irrevocably so."`
`"GyaaaaaaaaAAAaaaaaAAA!!`
` Why is everybody looking at me with those eyes filled with piittttttyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"Th-That's not true, Keiichi-kun...`
` Ok!`
` Let's do our best!`
` Here's where the comeback begins!"`
`"There's no coming back for Keiichi-san the geezer!!`
` Now give up quietly and accept your penalty!!"`
`Wh-What was today's penalty game again... !?`
`"Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"`
`"Alright!!`
` If you're real members of this club, show me you won't let anybody come back from this disadvantage!!`
` Alright, alright, let's keep it rolling!!"`
`...Heh heh heh.`
`"Aaaahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Whoa, Keiichi-kun seems happy? ...Why!? How can this be!?"`
`"Ahahaha!`
` He's probably awoken to the joys of cross-dressing~."`
`"Ah, Keiichi-kun, your hairband is going to fall off.`
` Let me fix that for you."`
`Rena cheerfully adjusted the hairband that had been enshrined upon my head.`
`"How does it feel, Kei-chan?`
` Have you awoken to the pleasures of wearing girl's clothing in front of actual girls~?`
`Be honest now.`
` It's alright!`
` We won't laugh~!!"`
`"Argggghh!!!!`
` You jerk!!!`
` I'm gonna murder you!!"`
`Swinging Mion's bag about wildly, I chased her in circles for a bit.`
`Today's loser was quickly decided to be me.`
`When I had been assured of finishing last, Mion showed her true power!!`
`She began racking up points with an iron fist. In the end, we didn't even have to add up the score to know who was on top.`
`After that, in the changing room...`
` With much wailing and gnashing of teeth,`
` pushing the boundaries of shame and brutality, I was instructed by Mion on how to put on everything from ribbons to underwear...`
`...D-Damn you Mion... What do you mean, knowing this will come in handy one day...`
`"Shhhhh!!`
` Kei-chan, you're too loud!`
` If you stay quiet you might be able to pass this off as rehearsal for a play~."`
`UnggooooOOOOOooooaaaaaaaAAAaaaa!!`
`I shuddered from head to toe, resisting the urge to scream.`
`"Actually, Kei-chan, you have really smooth skin.`
` Are you often told that it's easy to apply makeup on you?"`
`Saying that, Mion gently rubbed my cheek.`
`UwhoAA! What kind of man gets praised for being easy to apply makeup on them?`
`"How does it feel wearing a maid's hairband?`
` It really finishes off the look!`
` The hairband is the best part of a maid outfit, after all~!"`
`"Wh-Wh-What do you mean, finishes off the look!?`
` Dumbass!`
` Stop teasing me!!"`
`"Hehehehe!`
` Keiichi-kun is embarrassed. Kyuuuuute~...☆"`
`"I d-d-don't really feel a-anyth--!`
` Hey! Stop it!`
` Don't flip it up!!"`
`S-Stop~...!`
` Don't whisper such strange things in my ear~!!`
`H-Hau...!`
` My miserable manhood subtly shifted.... eek~...!`
`"You're turning red, you're turning red.`
` ...Have you finally realized it?`
` That's right.`
` Right now, Kei-chan is... exactly the type of maid that every healthy male wants."`
`Stop it, Mion~!`
` Really, why do you have to whisper that right in my ear!!!`
`"Have you ever just wanted to hold a maid close to you...?`
` Kei-chan, you've currently become one with that maid.`
` Don't you see?`
` That's a distance far closer than mere touch can ever achieve. `
`...There, can't you hear that pulse... that breath...?"`
`"Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mii-chan... That's... Hau...!"`
`On the verge of overheating, a long red line flowed out of Rena's nose.`
`"Putting on makeup properly, making you wear a wig with the straight, long hair you like so much...`
` ...Kei-chan, I've made you into your ideal woman...`
` And now, you're going to walk around town with me. `
`You'll surely monopolize the eyes of all the men.`
` ...That would definitely make you feel really good, wouldn't it...?`
`Saying that, she tried to flip my skirt!!`
` WaAa!!`
` This is definitely NOT the time!!`
` I can't let them see me with this male-centric probleeeeeeem!!`
`*CRASH* *THUD*`
`Before I realized it, Rena was caressing my head and rubbing me with her cheek.`
`"Keiichi-kun, when you were fidgeting like that, you were su-su-su-su-supeeer kyute!!`
` I-Iiiii'm going to take you hooome~~~!!!"`
`Peering through Rena's vice-like embrace, I saw Mion laying spreadeagle on her back.`
`...I see.`
`This must be what Satoko and Rika-chan feel like when they become Rena's prey...`
`After that, it took quite some time to calm Rena down from her frenzy...`
`"Later, Kei-chan.`
` Today was super enjoyable... hee hee hee!!"`
`"Gyaaaahahahaha!!`
` Only if you can beat me!`
` I look forward to seeing you try!"`
`Mion tossed me my clothes, and looking in as good a mood as I've ever seen her, left.`
`...Okay now.`
`"...Now that I've been released by Mion, I can't waste even a second running home."`
`"By the way.`
` Rena isn't as good as Mii-chan.`
` ...So if we happen to bump into anybody, I won't be able to follow up for you, okay☆?"`
`Soon after that, I went into a full-out dash!!`
`I'm pretty sure I was running the 100m in about 6 seconds there.`
`"Well then, Keiichi-kun.`
` See you tomorrow~!"`
`"Yeah! See you tomorrow!!!"`
`The fact that I didn't bump into anybody I knew was probably divine favor for my constant good behavior!`
`It's been going my way today...`
`At that moment the front door opened, as if somebody was waiting for me.`
`"Oh, Keiichi.`
` So you're home.`
` ...I was just about to go for a walk."`
`...I was dumbstruck by how slow my father was to react.`
`...A normal person would have realized the peculiar scene before them around: "Oh, Keiichi."`
`"Ah, umm... Dad.`
` ...This is ...you see, you know that club I'm always talking about? This is one of the penalty games we do there...`
` It just so happened I lost today..."`
`...My dad placed his hand on my shoulder.`
`It was an oddly moist, and uncomfortably warm hand...`
`"...Keiichi.`
` Let's have a little talk in my studio.`
` We'll keep it a secret from Mom, of course!!!"`
`"N-No Dad, let go!!`
` T-There's a show I want to watch right now!!!"`
`Mion, you shall rue this day!!!!`
`His artistic flame raging like wildfire, my dad dragged me along. I disappeared into the depths of the studio...`
`"Keiichi, are you home?`
` Oh, you were in the bath.`
` ...Is that... makeup remover?"`
`"Uh... I-- wahahahahahahaha!!!`
` M-More importantly, what's the matter?"`
`"Sorry.`
` I have a headache and don't think I can make dinner tonight.`
` I'm terribly sorry, but can you go out to eat with your Dad?"`
`My mom is a go-get-em superwoman at work, but it occasionally takes a toll on her health.`
`So this kind of situation is hardly a rarity.`
`"That's fine but...`
` What will you eat?"`
`"If it's just for myself, I can probably find a way to scrounge something together.`
` Take care."`
`"Keiichi~!!`
` We'll take the car so hurry up!"`
`Dad quickly got the car ready.`
`He must be hungry, he really only moves so energetically when it's time to eat.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` So, where are we going to eat?"`
`"...Hmmm.`
` I recently found a nice store. Let's go there!"`
`My dad usually only complains about things. For him to actually praise something is... unexpected.`
`I wonder what kind of place it is that he'd rank it 3 stars.`
`As one who seeks the way of the gourmand, I, Keiichi Maebara, am genuinely intrigued!`
`The headlights of the car cut through the early darkness of the Hinamizawan night, carving a straight path towards town.`
`I was pondering where such a gem of a restaurant could be hidden away... it was, shockingly, the family restaurant right by the station.`
`"Dad... that great restaurant you were talking about... was this?"`
`The words "Angel Mort" were written on a very family restaurant-esque cartoonish logo.`
`It had the air of a girl-oriented all-you-can-eat cake buffet rather than a proper restaurant.`
`"You've never been inside, Keiichi?"`
`Come to think of it... I hadn't.`
`There's been some times where I've travelled to faraway towns to eat.`
`But, returning only as far as Okinomiya Station, there was really no reason to dine out.`
`Home was just a stone's throw away after all.`
`...I see.`
` That was the reason I never noticed it before.`
`We stopped the car in the restaurant's parking lot.`
` ...It seems like business is booming.`
` There's quite a few cars parked here.`
`But what really amazes me are the license plates.`
`...There's a lot of them that can't be from this area.`
`...Fukuyama, Nagoya-- well that's fine...`
`...`
` Chiba!?`
` ...Saitama!?`
`Opening up my mental geography book, I calculated how long it would have taken to get here via the major highways...`
`"Heh heh heh.`
` Keiichi, it seems that you've finally realized how amazing this restaurant is..."`
`"W-What's the meaning of this!?`
` How can so many people travel from so far away just to come to this restaurant!?"`
`Following my dad, I climbed the steps and entered the building.`
`The bell attached to the door clattered as we entered, and a waitress soon greeted us. After confirming our party size and whether we wanted a smoking or non-smoking seat, she guided us inside.`
`Dad ordered two of the daily specials.`
`It seemed that they were ready-made, so there wasn't much of a wait at all until our meals were brought to us.`
`The taste was - no offense to Dad - not so different from your run-of-the-mill family restaurant...`
`"...If you're just talking about the taste... it seems like normal family restaurant fare."`
`"Who gives a damn about the taste, Keiichi!`
` See~...`
` Isn't it great~☆"`
`...I see.`
`It just may be... that the food here might be nothing more than average.`
`The demographic of the customers was pretty much all young men.`
`...It may call itself a "Family Restaurant," but there wasn't a single table with a family.`
`And yet it was packed.`
`The parking lot was filled with cars from all corners of the country.`
`...If they didn't come from far and wide to eat this completely mediocre food... then there's only one other reason.`
`Dad flagged down a nearby waitress.`
`"Excuse me~, the dessert that comes with the meal still hasn't come yet~."`
`"Oh... I—!`
` I-I'm so sorry..."`
`"There's a dessert that comes with Daily Combo A.`
` I've been waiting for quite a while."`
`"Oh it's— ...M-My apologies. I'll bring it right away!"`
`The apparently rookie waitress rushed off flustered.`
`"...Dad.`
` ...Could it be this restaurant is..."`
`"Aren't they great~?`
` The waitress's uniforms here, I mean~~♪."`
`BAM!!`
`"W-W-What are you doing, Keiichi!?`
` My own father never hit me!"`
`"I'm your son!!"`
`"Listen, Keiichi, I've never come here with impure intentions.`
`That belle and attirante and excentrique clothing, quel effet!`
` It is my artistic muse!`
` I wanted you to feel that!!`
` Even you must have yearned for this stimulation!!`
` Haven't you!? `
`Coming here alone, though, is a bit embarrassing.`
` You understand!!`
` That's why I dragged you here!`
` Just blame me!`
` Even if you must condemn me... I wanted you to know this feeling KeiichiiiIIIIiiiii!!!`
`.... Aah...`
` I need to take a leak..."`
`My father has always had a bad habit of trying to hide his embarrassment using incomprehensible nonsense as a smokescreen.`
` ...I want to believe that this weirdness won't be genetic.`
`Continuing his one-sided rambling, my father stood up and headed to the washroom.`
`With him gone, I was left alone in the booth.`
`...Finally, at this time, a feeling of embarrassment welled up inside me.`
`...I had nothing to do but go beet-red with shame.`
`The waitress from before returned, her eyes alternating between the order slip and the table.`
`"Uh... ummm..."`
`Arriving at my seat, she hesitantly tried to say something.`
`A more veteran waitress offered some advice from over her shoulder.`
`...Just calm down, and say "Sorry for the wait...!"`
`"Ummm... Terribly sorry for the wait..."`
`Right, right, just like that!`
` Do your best!`
`Whispering that into her ear, the veteran waitress left.`
`This waitress must have just been hired.`
`With an absolute lack of confidence, she moved hesitantly and maybe even somewhat perilously. Just watching her put me on edge.`
`I silently watched as she placed the dessert on the table with an inexperienced hand.`
`...But... it's just as Dad said... what incredible uniforms these are...`
`They were like... a bunny girl plus a maid plus some sort of frilly outfit, all in a perfect ratio... most certainly a rather dubiously charming kind of fashion. `
`...In any case, she in no way appeared to be a proper waitress.`
`What should I do... I was catching glimpses of too many things... that is... I didn't know where I should look.`
`Wearing something like that walking around the restaurant... it's as bad as it can be for digestion...☆`
`Even though she was wearing the outfit, this particular waitress had no idea what to do either.`
`This flustered state, without a doubt, should be attributed to the amount of bare skin showing rather than being new to the job.`
`Both the waitress and I mutually avoided eye contact... what a platonically embarrassing feeling this is.`
`...I'm a customer you know!?`
`It's alright to be more straight-forward!`
`....Hau~... my nose is starting to bleed~ ...`
`At that moment, our eyes just happened to meet.`
`Both of us blinked, doubting who we were looking at.`
`...What?`
` This is...`
`".........`
`Mion, is that you?"`
`".........Eh..."`
`On top of her hair being let down, she was so far removed from her usual confidence-filled attitude...`
` I didn't realize it was her at all.`
`It was Mion!!!`
` Why is she here!?`
`"You...`
` Why are you working at a place like this...!?"`
`"Uh,`
` Ah,`
` Ummm,`
` ...I-I'm helping out at my uncle's store..."`
`Come to think of it... I did hear her talk about how her relatives have stores in town, and that she sometimes works part-time to help them!`
`"......`
` Oooh~~~!`
` That must be a lot of work."`
`The nervous feeling I had dissipated in an instant.`
`Knowing that this was Mion, there was no reason to feel that way.`
`Well, actually... my animal instinct tells me that the power balance between Mion and myself has been turned upside-down!`
` That's right, I'm a customer!`
` My position is superior to hers!`
`The humiliation from today's penalty game was cutting through the recesses of my mind...`
`There really is a God!`
`For Him to grant me this opportunity for revenge!!!`
`Noticing the flames of vengeance burning in my eyes, Mion took a step back.`
`"But... seeing it like this, this type of clothing suits you very nicely, doesn't it~☆."`
`"I-It's embarrassing, so...`
` ...Don't look so much..."`
`I confirmed my pre-emptive strike was a clean hit!`
`There's no mistaking that Mion is currently defenseless!!`
`While confirming my attack was successful I simultaneously lined up the combo!!`
`"D-Don't... say... that..."`
`"Don't play coy with me~!`
` I know that you enjoy drawing all the male attention with that embarrassing get-up~!`
` I mean, if you didn't, there's no way you'd dress up like that~!"`
`"I-It's not like... I'm doing this... because I like to..."`
`I-Is this alright, Keiichi Maebara?`
` A-Aren't you taking this a little too far!?`
`Even if it's payback for that humiliation during the day... isn't this too much?`
`Hey, shut up, Logic!!`
`To pay back Mion tenfold is a chance you'll hardly ever get!!!`
`"Wearing this kind of get-up, your mother must be disappointed~!"`
`"*whimper*"`
`"That part where you can almost just see something is the best!`
` Come closer~!!"`
`"Eek~ ...Please stop~...!"`
`"You still lack the spirit of service towards your customers!!"`
`"P-Please forgive me~...!"`
`"Hau~~~I wanna take you home~~~♪"`
`"No, not thaaaAAaaaat~...!"`
`Entering a version of Rena's Kyute Mode, blood spewing from my nose like a waterfall, I was going until I had no regrets!`
` I was going to complete this verbal humiliation pla... --I mean-- revenge for today's events.`
`"Yup! I'll spare you the rest for today. ......Hau~~☆."`
`It seems that Mion's neural circuits had completely shorted from the embarrassment.`
`I might have teased her a little too much, or so I thought. But such a meek Mion is something you hardly ever see, so this was good for now.`
` ...Leaving aside what exactly was 'good.'`
`"I never knew.`
` To think that the High-and-Mighty Mion would have a hard time being a waitress!"`
`"......*whimper*...Um,`
` ...Th-That's wro--"`
`"This is such a surprising side of you~!`
` I want to show this to the Mion from this afternoon!`
` ...Actually, I want to show Rena and the others.`
` Rena will definitely flip out with joy! `
`Do you think she'll say she wants to work here?"`
`"Th-That's.... wrong..."`
`"I could never imagine in my wildest dreams that such a kyute outfit would suit you Mion!"`
`"I-I'm saying that's wrong!!"`
`While turning bright red, Mion finally spit out the words that were lodged in her throat.`
`"What do you mean,`
` ...That's wrong?"`
`"I-I'm!`
` .........`
`Not Mion!!!"`
`...Wha?`
` I was taken aback at Mion's confusing words.`
`"If you're not Mion... then who are you?`
` You're Mion Sonozaki right?"`
`"Umm...... I'm sorry.`
` I should have said this earlier but...`
` My name is Shion Sonozaki.`
` ...Mion is my older sister."`
`My eyes unconsciously widened with surprise from this brazenly crazy talk.`
`Mion, probably thinking that there was no way such a far-fetched excuse would work, turned bright red while fidgeting nervously.`
`"Shion...?`
` Shion Sonozaki?"`
`"Y-Yes...`
` I'm often mistaken for my sister..."`
`"But, when we met, you had the kind of response that you wouldn't make if we were meeting for the first time."`
`"Th-That's because... my sister is always talking about you... so I knew who you were..."`
`A little bit of a cringeworthy excuse, that is.`
`...But... when I looked at Mion's eyes, which begged me to believe her, the urge to tease completely subsided.`
`To us, Mion had to be a leader who was normally overflowing with confidence, a guiding force.`
`If I were to lash out at that Mion, I would have ruined something I shouldn't have.`
` That was something I would never wish for.`
`So I understand.`
` This foolishness here, is something very different from the everyday Mion.`
` That's why... she's "Shion."`
`".........I see.`
` In that case...`
` I'm sorry."`
`"O-Oh no, as long as you understand.`
` My sister has a lot of enemies, you see."`
`Well now, she's self-aware of that fact now is she.`
`As I unintentionally laughed aloud, Mion --no, Shion-- laughed with me.`
`"Actually, today is... umm... Kei-chan is my first customer."`
`A little flustered after saying that, she quickly asked if it was okay for her to refer to me the same way her sister did.`
`...Seeing that blatant quirk was so cute, I couldn't stop laughing.`
`"So, you said you've worked part-time at your uncle's store before?`
` I thought you would have been more used to it."`
`"Oh, I have other relatives that run shops.`
` That's why... this is the first time I'm helping the uncle that owns this place..."`
`I see, makes sense.`
` Anybody would be tentative doing a job they weren't used to.`
`"Does Mion ever help out at this store?"`
`"Oh, my sister is, you see...`
` She's not good with these cutesy things..."`
`...I know what she's trying to say.`
`"That's right.`
` Mion is more suited for cool things!`
` So I think having you help out here was the right choice."`
`"...Huh?"`
` Shion asked, probably thinking she misheard me.`
`"That uniform; it would never suit somebody like Mion.`
` ...But for Shion, I think it works."`
`"Huh,`
` ......You mean that`
` ...Ummm..."`
`Shion, like Rena often does, spaced out and turned bright red.`
`"Wh-...What does that mean... exactly..."`
`...At least for this moment, it felt like this Shion character actually existed.`
`...Because there was no way that the Mion I knew had this side to her.`
`At that moment, we realized that the more veteran waitress was waving at us from across the room.`
`"Sonozaki-sa~n, you can take your break now~!"`
`"Oh, o-okay...!"`
`Mion finally returned to her senses. It seemed as if it was time for her to take her break.`
`"Well, then... I'll take my leave. It was fun talking to the infamous Kei-chan."`
`"Sorry for mistaking you for Mion and teasing you.`
` Please tell Mion that I will have my revenge one day."`
`"Ah... that thing where you were forced to dress as a maid and walk around outside, right~?"`
`That devilish laugh and smile, it was exactly the same as the one I knew.`
`"That's right.`
` Tell her that I will return the favor for the total humiliation I suffered!"`
`"Bleh~.`
` More importantly, I'm going to complain to my sister about the teasing I had to endure today.`
` My sister will have my revenge during your club activities! Ahahahaha...!"`
`"Ahahahaha! Bring it on!! I'll get her before she gets me!!"`
`Mion laughed with a warm smile devoid of any remaining nervousness, and disappeared into the back...`
`...I felt like I had a very valuable experience today.`
`That's right, for now I know the High-and-Mighty Mion has a weak point to panic and get embarrassed about...`
`But, of all things... for her to say she has a twin sister...`
`I thought that maybe I should ask Rena tomorrow if she really has a sister.`
` ...But maybe it's better that I didn't ask.`
` ...It's a bit mean-spirited.`
`I've decided that the person I met here today was "Shion," the younger twin sister.`
` So, I'll refrain from doing anything that would deny that.`
`It's not that we actually made a promise or anything...`
` ...But that little exchange gave birth to a new rule between me and Mion.`
`Somebody tapped me on the shoulder.`
` It was my dad.`
`...That was a long trip to the washroom.`
`He probably came up with a new idea for an art piece when he was sitting on the can.`
`"Keiichi, are you about ready?`
` Let's go home."`
`Settling the bill, my father had his customer card stamped.`
` ......It was pretty much filled.`
` Damn, Dad, you're quite the regular customer...`
`"Was that new waitress just now somebody you know, Keiichi?"`
`"Oh, so you were watching from the shadows..."`
`Dad has the oddest sense of tact sometimes...`
`"Somebody from school?`
` From Hinamizawa?"`
`"Yeah. She's the little sister of my friend Mion.`
` Her school isn't in Hinamizawa, so she must go to one in town.`
` ...I've never seen her at my school."`
`"Hmmm. So not all the kids in Hinamizawa go to the same school?"`
`"Only about half.`
` The other half go all the way into town on their bikes."`
`In this way, the feeling that I was really talking to Shion came to me.`
`What should I say to Mion tomorrow?`
` I met your little sister! ...Something like that?`
`Even with Mion being like that, us having a secret between the two of us made me both a little happy and a little embarrassed.`
