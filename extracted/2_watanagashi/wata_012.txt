`"............Keiichi.`
` ...Keiichi...?"`
`"...Just leave him alone.`
` ...His friends went missing.`
` ...It must be really hard for him."`
`Normally, my dad never shows me any consideration... but this time he did.`
`"Shouldn't Keiichi stay home from school for a while, too?`
` I think it would be safer not to go until the police do something about this."`
`"...Maybe.`
` ...Compared to what could happen, taking a few days off wouldn't be a bad idea..."`
`"Anyway, how is it logical not to close school during such a dangerous situation?!`
` What do those teachers think our children are?!"`
`Mom and Dad were getting pretty riled up... but at this point, I couldn't care less.`
`...Besides, that wasn't the only thing I couldn't care less about.`
`...The breakfast table, the food in front of me, the time and date, myself... I really had no interest in anything.`
`This feeling... it was like a dead fog in my mind... It felt like... getting dizzy after taking strong medication.`
`"Keiichi.`
` How are your studies going?`
` You've gotten further than the other kids, haven't you?`
` If you have... then you can take a few days off, all right...?"`
`............I didn't even feel like answering.`
`...Today was Thursday.`
`...Only four days had passed... since the Watanagashi Festival.`
`Such a short time... and yet now things were completely different.`
` ...Everything had changed.`
`The tranquil village, bright and clear as if it were an Indian summer, had undergone a total reversal...`
`People were made to disappear every night... and we couldn't even relax when walking out in broad daylight... The village had become a world of fear.`
`I had no right to curse this outcome.`
` ...After all, the one responsible for everything... was me.`
`That night.`
`...I couldn't resist my honestly tiny, little, and incredibly stupid curiosity... and broke the taboo.`
`"...This isn't somewhere we should be going, is it?!`
` Let's not!`
` It's a crime to force your way into a locked building, even if you don't steal anything!! `
`...I prattled on as I took the lock from Tomitake-san's hands... and put it back on the door.`
`I'll forget everything I saw here, so come on!`
` Let's go, let's go!!`
`...Takano-san was fretting, but I pushed her away.`
` Tomitake-san grinned painfully.`
` Shion's shoulders drooped as if to call me an idiot.`
` ...Even so, I didn't care.`
`I pushed everyone farther and farther away.`
`...Rika-chan's dance was still going on.`
`...Then, at last, her dance was brought to a close with a roaring applause.`
`...I, too... until my hands turned red...`
` ...I clapped...`
` and I clapped...`
` ............`
`...Ding-dong.`
`"Isn't that Rena-chan?`
` She's here because it's your usual meet-up time, isn't she?"`
`I looked up at the clock.`
` It was five minutes past my time to meet with Rena.`
`"Keiichi.`
` Shouldn't you take a few days off from school?"`
`"............You're right.`
` .........Thanks for being so considerate."`
`I rose from my seat.`
`...I went to the entrance to greet Rena.`
`"Good morning.`
` ...We're going to school as a group starting today.`
` ...So you can't be late."`
`...Ah... That's right.`
`...If we, the ones farthest away, were to be late, the younger kids on the way there would be waiting for us.`
`"............Um.`
` ...I think I'm going to take some time off.`
` ...From school."`
`"............`
` ...Okay."`
`Rena answered shortly, nodding.`
`"...I think you should do whatever's best for you, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...So, you don't need to feel that you're weak or anything."`
`"............"`
`"Oh, and...`
` Here.`
` ...It's a notice they're sending around.`
` ...Could you give it to your mom?`
` I think it has a lot of important announcements in it."`
`I took the notice.`
`...There were a lot more pages than normal.`
`...The one on top... announced the disappearance of the mayor, Rika-chan, and Satoko, and that they wanted any information about them... It made my heart ache.`
`"............The police are looking as best they can, too.`
` They'll find them for sure.`
` Just be patient.`
` ...Okay?"`
`......Rena said, smiling in an attempt to give me courage.`
`...Rather than that, though... her smile looked like it was because she herself wanted to believe they were safe...`
`".........Rena, you're...`
` ...not going to question me?"`
`"............Nope."`
`"...Rena... you know, don't you?`
` ...About that night, what I..."`
`"Do you mean...`
` ...when you snuck into the ritual storehouse?"`
`...I was speechless for a moment... but then I bit my lip, made up my mind, and nodded a little.`
`"So it's all out in the open...`
` ...Really... I shouldn't do bad things like that..."`
`"...Mii-chan was really mad."`
`............So she was upset.`
`......I suppose... she would have been.`
`"I don't think she was as angry... about you sneaking in there, though...`
` as much as about you hiding it from her."`
`"............"`
`"Maybe, Keiichi-kun... Maybe you should have told her yourself and apologized."`
`...I should have told her myself... and apologized.`
` ...That troubled me.`
`...Just one week ago...`
`I did something... that I, myself, should have apologized to Mion for.........`
`I'd hurt her badly...`
`However, I hadn't realized that at all.`
`......Plus, with all the confusion that Shion's appearance had brought... I still hadn't been able to talk to Mion about it......`
`"............Rena... you're right.`
` ...I never... I never realize anything...... until you tell me............"`
`"Keiichi-kun.`
` .........Hypothetically.`
` ...If you had admitted you'd done something wrong right away... and apologized to Mii-chan.`
` ......I wonder if Rika-chan and Satoko-chan wouldn't have had to disappear."`
`"............"`
`I couldn't answer right away.`
`...I couldn't admit to that......`
`...Wasn't Rena telling me right now, though...?`
`...That I... should have admitted to my crime sooner.`
`...If I had done that, and apologized... Would things not have gone in such a horrible direction...?!`
`...Rena's eyes were filled with kindness, but they weren't naive enough to forgive me for keeping silent... and they stared fixedly into my own.`
`"............Yeah.`
` ...You're right."`
`...If I had admitted my crime sooner...`
` then Rika-chan and Satoko......`
` ...wouldn't have had to die or disappear...`
`...Smack!!!!`
`The palm of Rena's hand... slapped me in the cheek.`
`...I stood there unmoving... my head still tilted in the direction I'd been hit.`
`It didn't... hurt at all.`
`"I don't... think that anyone has scolded you, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...So I'll scold you in their place, okay?"`
`I pressed a hand to my cheek, now warm with embarrassment... and quietly stared down at Rena's feet...`
`"Going somewhere you're not allowed to go was a very bad thing to do!!`
` ...Do you understand that?!"`
`"...Uh-huh."`
`"Answer me with a 'yes'...`
` Keiichi-kun."`
`"...Yes."`
`"Also... what's even worse, you didn't admit to having done something so bad!!`
` You should never do anything bad in the first place... but not admitting to it or apologizing for it is much, much worse!!!"`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I was............ wrong..."`
`For a few moments... Rena stared at me, silently and intently... as if gauging my remorse.`
` ...Then, finally, the tension in her face softened... and she smiled.`
`"............Okay then... it's about time.`
` I should be going."`
`"...All right..."`
`"Be sure to... give the notice to your mom, okay?`
` Also, warn her not to go out to pass it on after it gets dark."`
`I bent down to pick up the notice, which I'd dropped when she slapped me.`
`...The pages had come out of the clasp and were now making a mess on the floor. I gathered them up one by one.`
`...My hands stopped at a single, more lighthearted page, with peaceful sentences dancing on it.`
`.........We still have plenty of homemade soy sauce in stock.`
` Feel free to come to the Sonozaki house if you want some.`
`"............What...`
` is this..."`
`I picked up the page and scanned the rest of it.`
`...They were stockpiling high-quality soy sauce they got from faraway relatives in the Akita Prefecture.`
`They had gotten a big shipment recently.`
`...They couldn't use it all, so they wanted anyone who wanted some of it to feel free to come over...`
` is what it said.`
`As a P.S., it said it arrived in barrels, and to please bring a two-liter bottle or other container for it.`
` ...That's how it tied together.`
`".........If you need some soy sauce...`
` then you would go to the Sonozaki house.`
` ...Rena.`
` ...Did you... Did you know all along...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I knew."`
`...Rena... had already been suspicious of Mion... as soon as she noticed that the big bottle of soy sauce was missing.`
`...Rika-chan had taken the bottle... and gone to Mion's house, and...`
` there... she was erased.`
`Rika-chan wasn't coming back... so Satoko called Mion's house, since she knew where she had gone, and...`
` then... Satoko got called there as well...`
`That meeting on the day the mayor disappeared... Didn't Ooishi-san say...`
` that the Three Families participated in it?`
`...The Three Families would include the Sonozaki family.`
`...Didn't he also say that the current leader was really old, so her heir, Mion, frequently stood in for her at public appearances?`
`While the mayor was returning from the shrine...`
` Mion called out and stopped him.`
`...She talked to him, and invited him to their house, and...`
` ...then...`
` she made him disappear.`
`It was probably even simpler... to make Shion disappear.`
`...Shion... was part of the Sonozaki family.`
` ...They probably knew exactly what she was doing at all times.`
` ...I'm sure they even knew her part-time job schedule, too.`
`Thinking back... wasn't that Angel Mort store managed by the Sonozaki family?`
` ...Setting up an ambush for her there... wouldn't have been any trouble at all...`
`"I'm... I'm going to Mion.`
` ...I'll go apologize."`
`"............"`
`"I'm going to... have her put an end to everything.`
` ...Mion probably won't forgive me easily... but I'll go and ask her... not to sacrifice anyone else."`
`With that decided... there was no need for me to be lazing around here.`
`I put on my shoes and slipped past Rena to exit the house...`
`...when she stopped me.`
`"I'm going too."`
`".........Rena... shouldn't you go to school...?"`
`"This is way more important than school."`
`"............Rena, you shouldn't come.`
` ...If you get wrapped up in this too... then I think I might actually go crazy."`
`...Rena didn't move her arm, which was blocking my way.`
`"......If Keiichi-kun disappeared as well...`
` then I think I might actually go crazy too.`
` ...So I won't let you go alone."`
`Rena argued boldly... as tears welled up in her eyes...`
` I saw them, and I knew the strength of her resolve...`
`"............All right.`
` Let's go.`
` .........Thank you... Rena."`
`Rena nodded slightly, but firmly... and finally let down the arm blocking me.`
`......Let's go...`
` to Mion's house.`
`I'll apologize...`
`for the crimes I've committed.`
`...Then, we'll put an end...`
`to these twisted days.`
`After that... I'll pray...`
`...that once more... we can return to those... fun, lively days.`
`With Rena following me... I left the house.`
`...In front of the house, there was a car waiting.`
` ...It was Ooishi-san.`
`"Hey, good morning.`
` Maebara-san.`
` To you too, Ryuugu-san.`
` Together so early in the morning? You make me jealous. Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu...!"`
`What a truly praiseworthy man he was, if he had been lying in wait so early in the morning just to pressure me into talking.`
` ...On this morning, though, maybe this was actually a good opportunity.`
`"You're from the police..."`
`"Oh, have I not introduced myself to you, Ryuugu-san?`
` Please, excuse my rudeness.`
` My name is Ooishi, from the Okinomiya police department.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"......Are we... telling Ooishi-san?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I think my palm is enough punishment for your crime, Keiichi-kun, but...`
` we should leave Mii-chan's to these people."`
`............Pain and sadness.`
` I looked down... as those emotions built up in my heart.`
`"...We have something to tell you, Ooishi-san."`
`"Well, now.`
` What about?`
` ...Should we stand here and talk,`
` or go inside the car?"`
`"In the car, please."`
`...I only continued to look down weakly...`
` ...All I could do was be thankful... for how dependable Rena was...`
`......At Rena's urging, I revealed everything to Ooishi-san.`
`The latter, while making sure to throw in murmurs that he was paying attention every now and then, took notes.`
` ...We continued that way for a while...`
`"............How do you feel?`
` Don't you feel a lot better now that you've told me?"`
`Ooishi-san asked this while scratching his head with his ballpoint pen.`
`...Of course I don't feel better.`
`...The price that had been paid up until now for me not owning up to my crimes... had been so immense...`
`But as long as that payment wasn't returned... the load on my chest could never be removed...`
`His radio started to emit static.`
`"...Bzz, bzz, this is Kumagai.`
` Ooishi-san? Over!"`
`"Yes, hello.`
` This is Ooishi."`
`"We got news a few minutes ago that she's been absent from school.`
` No movement at the Sonozaki house.`
` Our target is still on the premises."`
`"Yes, good. Keep a close watch out."`
`"Roger that.`
` The relief for three and seven just arrived, and they've returned to base.`
` ...Also, it looks like the division chief is looking for you, Ooishi-san. `
`He keeps bugging me, too, to tell him as soon as I get in touch with you... What do you want me to do?"`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha-ha...`
` If you're hard pressed for an answer, tell him you're actually under orders not to wake me from my morning nap."`
`"Got it."`
`Bzz! The radio grew silent.`
`"Sorry about that.`
` It was about work."`
`"...He just said there was no movement at the Sonozaki house, didn't he?"`
`"Oh, my... Did it sound like that to you?`
` This won't do.`
` Please, keep that a secret, all right?`
` I don't have permission from the division chief to be making private inquiries like this."`
`...Ooishi-san... had suspected Mion for a long time.`
`"...Nor for questioning witnesses, or for searching houses... We don't have permission for anything, really.`
` The Sonozaki house's defenses said to protect the family members are also in full working condition. `
`Without a warrant, we can't do anything about anything, unless the crime happens right in front of us. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`".........Ooishi-san...`
` Could you be..."`
`Rena's tone of voice alone was enough to make her spite clear as she stared at Ooishi-san.`
`"You can't set foot in the Sonozaki house.`
` ...Were you trying to get Keiichi-kun to go in there instead?"`
`"...Rena, that's... What do you mean...?"`
`"This person... Just as I thought, he plays really dirty."`
`"......Stop, you're hurting my reputation.`
` That said, I'm all ears to your explanation, okay?"`
`Ooishi-san lit a cigarette and responded to Rena, wearing an expression implying he was calm and willing to let her comment slide.`
`"You can't get a warrant, but you've always had your eyes on Mii-chan because you thought she was suspicious."`
`".........Hmm, yes?"`
`"...You plotted to incite Keiichi-kun and have him go to the Sonozaki house.`
` ...Then, if something were to happen to him, you would have used that as an excuse to go in.`
` ...Isn't that right?"`
`............I only understood about half of what Rena was saying...`
`...I knew, however, that Ooishi-san had been trying to use me.`
`"...Even if Keiichi-kun got hurt as a result.`
` ...Have you no shame?!`
` Is this how the police do things?!"`
`".........My, my.`
` ...It seems we have an incredible detective on our hands.`
` ...Oh my, oh my.`
` ...Would you be interested in taking our exam? `
`I'd gladly write a recommendation letter to get you into the detective division. Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu...!!"`
`"You're despicable."`
`Rena spoke quietly, her words dripping with hostility.`
`"...I've been insulted in all kinds of ways in my life, but one or two words from a young girl is always the roughest for me."`
`"Even so... I suppose I should thank you for not arresting Mii-chan yet."`
`"Don't mention it."`
`Ooishi-san seemed to be enjoying his exchange with Rena.`
`...The things this man thought were like a swamp... I could barely see past the surface.`
`...It reminded me again... of how much I disliked him.`
`"......Now then.`
` As two esteemed friends of Mion Sonozaki-san, what do you plan on doing now?`
` Will you wait kindly for me to go over the evidence and request a warrant?"`
`"No.`
` We won't wait for that.`
` ...We'll go... and make Mii-chan surrender herself."`
`...That's right.`
`...If she turned herself in rather than be arrested, she might get a lighter sentence...`
`At this point, perhaps that was... the only pity I could find in me to afford her.`
`"I see, I see. I wonder if it will go that well.`
` ...If you're careless, you two may face danger, you know."`
`...Ooishi-san was measuring our resolve.`
` ...So, in a strong voice, I declared:`
`"We're... fully prepared!"`
`...Ooishi-san gave us an unpleasant, yet seemingly satisfied grin.`
`...It was then that I realized this man was trying to use us for his own convenience.`
`"If anything should happen to us, use that as an excuse.`
` ...Though my greatest hope is that you will surround the place so that the criminal can't get away."`
`"...Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!`
` Ryuugu-san, you're good at negotiating, too.`
` I'm throwing in the towel.`
` I surrender."`
`"......Wh-What are you talking about...?"`
`"If the policemen surround Mii-chan's house...`
` ......Then that will be insurance for the worst-case scenario.`
` ...For the worst case."`
`Plus, it would be another way of pressuring Mion to give herself up, wouldn't it...?`
`"Ahh... Ooishi to Kuma-chan.`
` Ooishi to Kuma-chan."`
`"Bzz ...bz, this is Kumagai.`
` Go ahead."`
`"Our two friends are going to play at the Sonozaki house.`
` ...Make arrangements so that we can reinforce them if needed."`
`"Roger! Zzz!"`
`...Their altogether too-short conversation... implied that our questioning was already a part of their plans.`
`"Then... let's get going.`
` Want to buy some tea biscuits on the way there?"`
`Neither Rena nor I went along with Ooishi-san's stupid joke.`
