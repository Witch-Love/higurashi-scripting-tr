`There was something I didn't like about my child.`
`I first realized it when I started writing these things down.`
`They never warn you about it in any books about raising children, but they aren't just a plaything.`
`If they aren't able to feel loved even when they're not doing exactly as their parents want them to, then those parents are failures.`
`This wasn't something like that, though.`
`How can I say it...`
` It's probably harder to express with mere words.`
`I just want my child to be average.`
`As long as they weren't falling behind, there wasn't any need for them to excel at something.`
` As long as they acted appropriately for their age, I would have been fine with it.`
`But my child had been different ever since kindergarten.`
`While the children in her class were running around in excitement about the field trip the next day, she only wore a bored look on her face, aloof and distant.`
`When the other kids broke the equipment for the athletics festival and were apologizing fervently, she only wore a bored look on her face, aloof and distant.`
`When the teacher was reading a fun picture book, only she wasn't smiling.`
`Even if they all got to eat a delicious bento, only she wasn't happy.`
`...If it was only this, it would still be in the realm of understanding.`
`However, what I don't understand about my child is that if the aforementioned situations happened again, they'd now act in a manner befitting their age.`
`I don't understand the principle behind that, as a parent.`
`Why were they indifferent about that field trip, but happy about this one?`
`Why were they indifferent about that picture book, but happy about this one?`
`Why were they indifferent about that bento, but happy about this one?`
`The former and the latter in each situation seem exactly the same to me.`
`...There was even times when I thought the former one was better.`
`I don't understand that child's feelings.`
`During parent-teacher meetings, the teacher always says the same thing.`
`And I would always respond that I don't understand my own child, and we would mope together.`
`My husband, always the optimist, once said that a young child's feelings are different from an adult's, so if there were some things we didn't understand, we shouldn't worry about it.`
` I lament his lack of urgency.`
`One day, when I was in a good mood.`
`I took the effort to prepare a menu that my child would enjoy.`
`...But she only smiled with a vague expression of disinterest.`
`That attitude frankly made me angry, so I hit her on the head.`
`On a day when the weather was nice.`
`The laundry I had just hung up to dry was blown by a large gust of wind, causing the entire line to fall down.`
`...But she, watching me trying to pick up the laundry in a panic, stood there laughing.`
`That attitude frankly made me angry, so I hit her on the head.`
`I think the same sort of thing happened countless times.`
`Before I knew it, my child was only able to look at me with an indifferent expression on her face.`
`...I regret the fact that I've been a bad mother.`
`Thinking I should regain her trust, I thought to get it back little by little with some light interactions.`
`Seeing her do some sort of craftwork on the veranda, I called out to her.`
`"These past few days have been nice and sunny. The air feels nice, doesn't it?"`
`"......"`
`That child, with that indifferent look on her face I hated so much, looked up at me for a moment, then without a word returned to immersing herself in her craftwork.`
`...Up until now, I would have hit her on the head just for that.`
` ...I held myself back.`
`"What are you making?`
` Is it a doll?"`
`"......A weather charm."`
`That child was using inserts from the newspaper to deftly make some weather charms.`
`The forecast hadn't called for rain.`
`But that child, in her own way, was praying that these sunny days would continue.`
`Being able to understand my own child for the first time in a while, I couldn't hide my own happiness.`
`Bringing out a ball of yarn, I began to hang my child's cute weather charms from the eaves of the house.`
`"Ahahaha...`
` It's no good, Rika.`
` The heads are too heavy, see?`
` They've become reverse weather charms now.`
` If they're like this, they'll call the rain instead of the sun."`
`When I started to take them down, my child tugged at the hem of my shirt as if to stop me.`
`"......That's because I made them to be upside-down. They're fine."`
`"...But, Rika.`
` If they're upside-down, they won't be a charm that calls for a sunny day, you know?"`
`"I was making a charm for it to rain, so they're fine."`
`...I desperately suppressed the emotions welling up inside of me. I was trying desperately to understand my child.`
`"Oh... I see...`
` The morning glories in the garden were starting to get a little wilted from all the sun, so you wanted some rain, right?"`
`That child turned to me with the expression that I hated the most.`
`"I got bored... of the clear weather."`
`...I don't understand, I don't understand.`
` ...I just can't understand that child...`
