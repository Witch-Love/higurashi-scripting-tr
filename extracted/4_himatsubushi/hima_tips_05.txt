`The sound of the car grew closer, followed by the sound of it braking as the engine cut out.`
`At that moment, his up-until-now lackadaisical footsteps grew decisive as the man in the room dashed up to the wall beside the window and carefully peered outside...`
`...It was his comrade's car.`
`Even so, he still didn't relax his guard.`
`Eventually, the sound of footsteps approached the door.`
` ...Thump,`
` thump thump thump.`
` It was the passcode.`
`"...I'm back.`
` Open tha door already."`
`"Ahh, you must be tired.`
` I'm opening it now."`
`After the locks were undone and the door opened, a man appeared, his arms laden with swollen plastic grocery bags.`
`The bags in his hands had "Sevens Mart" written on them, with bread and milk cartons able to be glimpsed within.`
`The contents of those bags were then spread out over a sheet on the floor.`
`"I bough' some cup noodles, so go boil some water.`
` ...Whas' the kid doin'?"`
`"Hm?`
` He's been sleeping the entire time.`
` Thank god he's not causing any trouble.`
` He did struggle a bit when he was about to shit himself."`
`"Don' let 'im crap 'is pants.`
` It'd suck if it started smellin' like an outhouse in 'ere."`
`"...Yeah, I know."`
`"Check tha gag every now and then.`
` We don' wan' it ta get loose, so keep it tigh'...`
` but not so tigh' that 'e stops breathin'."`
`"I said, I know...`
` Huh? Didn't I ask you to pick up another can of gas for the portable stove?`
` We're out."`
`"Ya never asked, ya ijit."`
`"...Gaah... seriously? Come on, work....`
` Dammit!!"`
`He rattled the portable stove as he struggled to get it to light.`
`...Seeing that, the man who went to buy supplies let out a deep sigh.`
`And with a backwards glance at that sight, began to walk to the corner of the room.`
`...The kidnapped boy was sprawled out on a sheet that was spread out on the floor.`
`"....Boy,`
` ya doin' okay?"`
`Of course, the man didn't assume the kid was able to hear that question.`
`That was because the boy's ears were plugged, with his eyes and ears thoroughly covered by packing tape.`
`Also, his mouth was gagged with a thin, twisted-up towel.`
`...Because of that, the boy was unable to close his mouth properly, his cheeks sticky with his own saliva.`
`Of course, that wasn't the only reason.`
`Both his arms were tied tightly behind his back with a leather belt.`
`"Ya seem ta be doin' okay.`
` At leas',  yer not gonna die.`
` ..If yer grampa wanted to play tough, we migh' have had ta lop off an ear.. it'd be great if we don' have ta... `
`If tha Main Family says we do, though... tough luck.`
` ...I can' even imagine wha' kind of cruel things they'd have us do. `
`...Tha Family says not one scratch on 'im though, so it seems to be going well for tha time bein'..."`
`"The Minister is discretely withdrawing the dam project.`
` The Hinamizawa Dam is indefinitely postponed.`
` ...I wonder when we're letting the boy go.`
` ...I just want to be done with this already."`
`"Tha Main Family seem ta be gaugin' tha timin'.`
` I don' know when it'll be, but prob'ly soon."`
`"Isn't that great, kid?`
` You'll be let go real soon, heh heh heh..."`
`The men didn't know if their voices were heard by the boy.`
`...For him, there was nothing he could do but continue to sleep to escape his harsh reality...`
`"More importan'ly, wha' are we gonna do about tha gas?`
` We can' eat the cup noodles raw!!`
` If we're out of gas say something, geez!!"`
