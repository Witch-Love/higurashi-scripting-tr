`"Nobody move!!`
` Any weird movements, and you'll come face-to-face with synchronized Gatling guns, multiple homing missiles, and be cut up by laser sabers for the finisher!!"`
`"I thought it was you, Shion!!`
` Even though you get to be the main character for a scenario, this is how you behave!?`
` Now you've gone and done it!!"`
`"Yup.`
` In the first half of the Watanagashi chapter, there were a lot of people getting infatuated with Mii-chan."`
`"...What're you trying to do?`
` ...The Meakashi script?`
` I see, you're planning to secure your role before any of your lines get cut out, aren't you?`
` Hee hee hee... resistance is futile."`
`"...You can't do anything just by getting your hands on the script...`
` ...Rena, I'm sorry, but do what they say..."`
`"It's alright, don't worry.`
` Now that we have the Meakashi script... we can reverse this situation!"`
`"Th-That voice is... Kei-chan!?!?`
` No way, he's still supposed to be recording lines at the studio!"`
`"Hu-hu-hu!!`
` You're right, I was until just now."`
`"Every time I get left at the studio, I get told 'you can join the afterparty if you beat someone on the remaining word count.'"`
`"But I always have two to three times the script volume of the other characters, making it impossible.`
` It's like the sound director doesn't want to let me join the party from the get-go!`
` At least, that's what I had thought..."`
`"But finally, someone overtook me! A certain character!!`
` Shion, feast your eyes on this!!"`
`"Huh? ...Ga, gah?!"`
`"That's right!`
` Now she's appearing in more scenes as the main character, Shion has to speak twice the lines she's had so far!`
` And since Shion and Mion have the same VA cast, that's double again!"`
`"As a result, I've finally been excused from staying back!!`
` Meaning, Shion, it's your turn to be left behind!!"`
`"N-No way?!`
` I have to speak this much for Meakashi?!"`
`"Let's see... Kei-chan has about 500,`
` and Shion has... over 2700?!`
` That's like the total for all the characters together in a normal adventure game!!"`
`"...Further adding on Mion's lines,`
` makes a total of-"`
`"Waaaah! I don't want to know, I don't want to know!!"`
`"So, with that.`
` Rena, you have my thanks!!`
` When even the moon abandons the land and shrouds it in true darkness,`
`"I see.`
` So?`
` How is Kei-chan going to appear here, when he's still at the studio recording lines?`
` ...It's not as if anyone here will have surpassed his workload.`
` Heh heh heh!!"`
`"...Gah!!`
` No!!`
` That's the voiced word count from Akasaka's part!!!`
` Chie-sensei, hold Rena-chan back!!"`
`"...It's finally your time! Keiichi-kuuuuuuuuun!!!!!"`
`"...He's completely flipped from the pent-up frustration of being unable to participate until this point."`
`"It's just like when a student who felt repressed studying for college entrance exams becomes a degenerate the moment they get in."`
`"This isn't some sort of transformation. I'll have you know I've always been a Demon Lord!!`
` And the dark power I obtained during my suppressed nightmare truly knows no bounds!! `
`Within this world of darkness, created by me and for me, there are none who can oppose me!!!!"`
`"Maebara-sama, you're the best~~!!!!!`
` How about a bunny girl, or booth babe costu-- no no, a leotard could be good too!! `
`No, wait!!`
` How about just about making everybody hyper sexy!!!`
`B-But of course, leave the socks on!!!"`
`"...You're so naive, Kei-chan.`
` If you carelessly bring about the dark world and fully welcome silly fantasies, a certain somebody will be able to reveal their true form.`
` That's simply unfa---hrmph!!!"`
`"Oh.`
` Then you're saying you want to withdraw from being the lead in`
` 'Documentary!! Satoko's Maid Training, Dress-up Chapter'`
` that we planned on filming after this?"`
` Every. Afterparty. `
`Always being last in the studio, missing every after-recording meal. Witness my`
` anger,`
` my grudge,`
` and all of my sorrow!!`
`I shall instill it all upon you!!!"`
`"Wa-Wa-`
`Wait a minute,`
` this here,`
` there's no way, right,`
` that's cheating,`
` that's not even the same game!!!!`
` Hey, she can't do this, right!?!?`
` Wa-wait, you can't use that big one!!!`
` Huuuh!? `
`T-too fast!?`
` Those moves, you've quit being a human!!!`
` Gyagyagyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"`
