`Patients admitted to the hospital can only accept calls at fixed times.`
`...That's why she wouldn't be receiving a call from him today.`
`Yesterday, she had teased him that he got lonely easily, so he might have struggled with the idea of calling her sooner.`
`That was much easier to imagine, rather than that he might just be too busy to call.`
`...Because he's just that type of person.`
` Yukie, whispering that, smiled to herself.`
`The announcement that visiting hours were over played over the hospital intercom along with some music.`
`She exchanged pleasantries with the family of the patient that was staying in the same room as her.`
` Probably eager for his mother to be discharged, their small child was wearing a beaming smile.`
`That child's mother was pregnant in the bed next to mine with what may be their new brother or sister.`
`They were probably ready to burst with the expectations, dreams, and worries of having a new sibling.`
`The joys of a growing family.`
`...Bathing in those warm feelings, I stroked my own belly, which had grown quite large.`
`I had talked with him about how many children we wanted to have.`
`We talked about how if we had three, it would certainly be lively.`
`...However, there was the inescapable worry of whether I would be able to handle giving birth that many times.`
`"There isn't a mother out there who would hate to give birth because of that worry, though..."`
`Yukie, smiling as she said that to herself, gently stroked her stomach.`
`The Metropolitan Public Safety Division.`
`The place where that man's sense of justice had lead him.`
`...That person was actually a very gentle, very fragile person.`
`He didn't talk much about the specifics, but I didn't think he was suited for the assignment he was on right now.`
`But... as long as he said he was going to try his best, I would watch over him warmly.`
`"Your father, you see... is a very hard worker, you know?`
` Coochie coochie coo...â˜†."`
`Yukie seemed to be enjoying herself as she talked to her own belly.`
`...At that moment, Yukie suddenly became concerned about something, and looked out the window.`
`It used to be this time...`
`Long ago.`
` She remembered that when she was little, around this time in the countryside where her grandmother lived, the higurashi would fill the air with their chorus.`
`This was the middle of Tokyo.`
`Unlike in the countryside, you couldn't hear the song of the higurashi.`
`...But for some reason... at that moment Yukie felt that she wanted to hear that song.`
