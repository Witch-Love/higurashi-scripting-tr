` was a hatchet.`
`But for that hatchet!?`
`There was no excuse for that!!!`
`A hatchet... just like that!!??`
`"Then what about that hatchet!?"`
`...Then as both of her hands met above her head... the hatchet that she held came into focus.`
`Rena stayed like that, with that hatchet raised above her head, and solemnly opened her mouth...`
`Rena took one step forward... still holding the hatchet high above her head.`
`Thrown about by the unbalanced weight of the hatchet, she was sent backwards as if she had been carried off by the wind.`
