`I flopped the colorful collection of cup noodle bowls into the cart, muttering in irritation at being rushed by my parents.`
` As expected, Mom gave a disbelieving look and asked why I had to get so many flavors.`
`Looking displeased at the sheer amount and the number of different varieties,`
` Dad told me to go get a multipack instead of individual ones.`
`Mom and Dad were already waiting in line, calling for me as I struggled with the decision.`
`The line is short, and there isn't much time...!`
` Left with no choice, I quickly search the cases of noodles for what I want.`
`When in trouble... That's it! Pork-bone & Ginger, extra large!!`
`So, when I plonked a large box of pork-bone flavor in the shopping cart, Mom looked back at me with an expression as if to say "...These ones?"`
` To show her this was my last compromise, I began explaining the choice.`
