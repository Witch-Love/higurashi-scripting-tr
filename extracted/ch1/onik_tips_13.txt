`"Hypovolemic shock induced by clawing out their own throat.`
`Tissue is packed under the nails.`
` Not someone else's nails.`
` It's undoubtedly by the individual's own nails.`
` The shape of the scars also matches."`
`"Yeaaaah...`
` I know the immediate cause of death was suicide."`
`"I get it.`
` You're saying the cause of death is unnatural, right?"`
`"It's not quite on the same level as when your back itches and you scratch a little too hard and draw blood, after all."`
`Some of Tomitake's fingernails had been pulled out.`
`Fingernails actually rip off surprisingly easily.`
`But it really hurts.`
`Under normal circumstances, the pain would prevent you from completely pulling them out.`
`Also, there were a lot of bruises on Tomitake's body.`
`...It's clear from the shape of them that he was assaulted first by someoneâ€”or a group of people.`
`"According to the toxicology report, the deceased was in an extreme state of hysteria right before death."`
`"Then he fought back and clawed out his own throat because of how hysterical he had become?`
` The guys attacking him certainly would have been surprised by that."`
`It is possible that, in such an abnormal environment, a person could perform acts that a sane individual couldn't possibly imagine.`
`Of course, those are very rare cases.`
`"Actually, Ooishi-kun,`
` that wood plank the deceased used as a weapon?`
` They only found sand and the paint from the guardrail on it."`
`"What about cloth fibers or skin?"`
`"Nothing.`
` The deceased didn't strike the assailants...`
` Or it could be they took the plank he was fighting back with."`
`"In that case, they wouldn't have gone out of their way to replace it with another.`
` They'd take them all."`
`"Har har har har!`
` That's true."`
`"Tomitake's pretty built and tanned...`
` He was quite athletic."`
`"Hm?`
` That's right.`
` He was pretty active."`
`...I can't imagine what kind of sports he did when he was alive, but I think his physical strength would be on the higher side.`
`Meaning, he would be difficult to overpower in a brawl.`
`If a man with such a physique sensed he was in danger and swung the plank around frantically...`
`It's just unthinkable that it wouldn't even nick the perpetrator.`
`And his opponent was unarmed.`
`This guy had a wooden plank, so you'd think he'd hit them at least once...`
`"To surround and take down someone of his physique...`
` I wonder how many people it would take."`
`"Ya dimwit...`
` If anything, that's your specialty.`
` Have you forgotten your 'Bad Cop' days?"`
`If I was to take down this guy, how many would I need?`
`When a group wants to take down big prey it's fundamental to attack with numbers.`
`...I'd guess about four.`
`Even if there was a gap in their strength, they'd manage.`
`"Then there were quite a few perpetrators.`
`So any drunk-and-disorderly groups of more than four are suspicious?"`
`...A group of four or more.`
`Just... if they had that many, then couldn't they have hidden the body in a less obvious location?`
`Or... did he somehow break away from that fatal predicament...`
`Then there would be no reason to commit suicide.`
`Moreover, I still can't comprehend the irregular way he died...`
` It's full of mysteries.`
`"That's under serious consideration on my end, too.`
` I'll be examining it as thoroughly as possible, but don't get your hopes up.`
` After all, we've never encountered a death like this before."`
`"I'm not hoping for much.`
` But I am looking forward to the results."`
`"Ooishi-san~!`
` The chief is calling you!"`
`"Thanks. See ya 'round."`
`"Yeah.`
` Best wishes!"`
