`While staring off into the stream, I somehow got separated from Rena.`
`I wasn't very lonely though.`
`I know this place now.`
` ...This is where I live. My home.`
`It's probably better if I just stay here instead of wandering around aimlessly.`
`Someone would surely find me while I was enjoying the evening breeze.`
`...I heard a familiar voice.`
` It was Tomitake-san's.`
`I headed towards it.`
`"How did it go, Tomitake-san? Were you able to get some good shots?"`
`"Yeah. Fortunately!"`
`Tomitake-san was with a girl.`
` ...I felt a little like I was intruding.`
`"How was it, Keiichi-kun?`
` Did you enjoy the festival?"`
`From the way she spoke, it seemed like she was a resident of Hinamizawa.`
`...I really should try harder to remember people's faces here.`
`What was her name...?`
`"Well... umm... It was fun."`
`My face must have given away how desperately I was trying to remember her name, because she gave a lighthearted chuckle.`
`"It's probably because it hasn't been long since you moved here.`
` It's pretty hard to believe, seeing how friendly you've gotten with the other kids."`
`If that's how it looked, it was probably all thanks to Rena and Mion.`
`"Perhaps you feel more like a resident of Hinamizawa after taking part in the festival today...?"`
`"...Hmm...`
` I wonder about that."`
`"Oh, that's not like you."`
`I had tried to get used to Hinamizawa.`
`But... there were still plenty of things I didn't know.`
`The faces of people I'd met, for example.`
` ...Things that had happened in the past, as well.`
`"...Oh.`
` You're feeling left out because of something like that?"`
`"It's not so much as feeling left out...`
` It's just... I'm not sure how to say it..."`
`That incident at the dam construction site.`
` The fighting over it and other conflicts.`
`...That terrible incident they pretended they didn't even know about whenever I brought it up.`
`Even though it was in the past... As someone living in Hinamizawa, it wasn't wrong to want to know about both the good and bad that had happened here.`
`"If it will put you at ease, then I'll tell you everything I know."`
`Tomitake-san's smile made me more relieved than I'd ever been.`
`It was hard to think of what to ask when someone said "ask me anything," though.`
`...Even when there was so much I wanted to ask.`
`"Then... could you tell me about what happened when the dam was being constructed?`
` There was a big incident where Hinamizawa was going to be submerged, right...?"`
`"I think the locals would be more knowledgeable about the dam than I am.`
` Well, if you don't mind, I'll tell you what I know.`
` ...It's only what I read in the newspaper though."`
`Tomitake-san's eyes entered an unfocused gaze as he searched through his memory. Then he spoke.`
`"The decision to start the dam project was finalized seven or eight years ago.`
` I heard it was the next largest project after the one in Kurobe."`
`There were three major issues in Japan at that time.`
`Improving inter-island transportation infrastructure, meeting the higher demand for electricity,`
` and flood control.`
`There was a boom of dam building due to the massive economic stimulus they provided on top of generating electricity and flood control.`
`Hinamizawa had the right conditions to support dam construction, so it was singled out.`
`"The dam reservoir would have covered quite a lot of ground when it was completed.`
` The entire area, right up to Yagouchi way upstream, would be underwater."`
`"...But... why did they have to pick a populated area like Hinamizawa?`
` Couldn't they have instead picked a place where nobody lived?"`
`"Hmm~... I'm not really sure why, but I heard that it was just the right terrain for building a dam."`
`Of course, there were protests here in Hinamizawa.`
`Rika-chan had said that they had 'fought.' From that choice of words I had to guess things had turned violent.`
`"There was a trial and it was even brought up before the National Diet.`
` It was covered in the Tokyo newspapers, too."`
`Mion had told me all about that, as well.`
`I'm sure every resident of Hinamizawa had united to fight together.`
`...The feeling of solidarity found here, which could not be expressed properly with mere words, was likely brought about by that battle.`
`"As a result, bribery and scandals were brought to light.`
` As things got more and more complicated, they eventually halted construction."`
`If I wanted to know, now was my only chance to ask.`
`It was certainly a bizarre incident that boys my age would be curious about.`
`I felt a little shame from the fact I was petty enough to have my curiosity piqued by Rena and Mion's refusal to talk about the event...`
`But I figured I might as well ask since I had the chance...`
` Just so I would stop thinking about it so much.`
`"So... there was a dismemberment... right?"`
`"There was.`
` I happened to be here in Hinamizawa at the time,`
` so I remember it well."`
`Tomitake-san's answer was nonchalant in contrast to my hesitantly forced-out question.`
`"...It was about this time, four years ago.`
` It was the day of the Watanagashi, if I recall correctly."`
`Debate on whether to continue construction on the dam was in disarray. Scandal after scandal rocked the project near the end.`
`...The incident that was the final nail in the coffin for the dam project.`
`A fight at the dam construction site ended in the victim being murdered.`
`Fearing prosecution, the six assailants divided the remains into six pieces and each hid one.`
`Five of the six criminals turned themselves in out of guilt, but one was still on the run.`
`The right arm he'd hidden had yet to be found.`
`The major details lined up with what was in the tabloid I'd read earlier.`
`It certainly was a tragic incident... but it wasn't so terrible that Rena and Mion needed to hide it from me.`
`I guess they didn't want someone who'd just moved here to have a negative impression of Hinamizawa.`
`I felt grateful for having friends who worried so much about me, as well as shame for still being so interested in it.`
`"It was near the end of all the trouble with the dam, you see.`
` So everyone was saying that it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`"Oyashiro-sama's curse, huh..."`
`Oyashiro-sama was the name of the god at the shrine that held the festival today, if I recalled correctly.`
`I see.`
`Their guardian deity rained divine punishment down on the evil dam construction for trying to flood Hinamizawa.`
`"Apparently the younger ones didn't think so...`
` But it seems the elderly in the village never doubted that it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`The woman with Tomitake-san chuckled mischievously.`
`Tomitake-san began laughing with her. It was so infectious I ended up laughing as well.`
`"...But... I wonder about now.`
` There are quite a few, I think.`
` Amongst the youth, too."`
`"A few... what?"`
`"People who believe...`
` in Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`The woman's lips were still curled into a smile, but her expression turned stern.`
`"Then after that...`
` it continued every year.`
` ...Always around this time."`
`"Continued? What continued?"`
`Tomitake-san paused for a second as if to build up some suspense. Then he whispered to me, as if someone might have been listening.`
`"Every year... on the day of the Watanagashi...`
` ...Somebody dies."`
`"The year following the dismemberment, on the day of the Watanagashi...`
`A man from Hinamizawa who had supported the dam fell off a cliff overlooking some rapids and died, while he was on vacation.`
` Speaking of his wife, unfortunately, her body was also never recovered."`
`"He supported the dam construction even though he lived in Hinamizawa.`
` At the time, there were whispers amongst the elderly saying it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`The woman chuckled mischievously again.`
`"The shrine's Shinto priest... You mean he was from the shrine here?"`
`The woman nodded.`
`"There was a rumor amongst the villagers that they weren't able to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger."`
`"Then the year after that, again on the night of the Watanagashi...`
` they discovered the battered body of a local housewife."`
`...Housewife?`
`Up until now, all these mysterious deaths were people involved with the dam or who had connections with Oyashiro-sama.`
`With that in mind, could the housewife have been involved in some way, too?`
`"Exactly."`
`The woman stated slyly.`
` ...No, it was more menacingly.`
`"The victim's family, you see...`
` happened to be that of the younger brother of the dam supporter who fell to his death two years before."`
`"The younger brother is still alive, it seems,`
` but it did bother him quite a bit. So he moved to the neighboring town."`
`...For a while, I stood there with my mouth agape.`
`The battle over the dam construction, with Hinamizawa's future at stake,`
`and the murder at the center of it all.`
`That was all I knew, and that was all I wanted to ask about.`
`But that wasn't all there was to the story.`
`Homicide.`
` Body disposal.`
` Accidental deaths.`
` Terminal illness.`
` Suicide.`
` Fatal beatings.`
`I'm a pretty level-headed person...`
`I don't really want to believe in curses...`
`But... the freakish deaths happened every year, on the day of the Watanagashi, and all of them were related to the dam construction...!?`
`It was easy to dismiss each of them as coincidences by themselves.`
`But when you put them all together...`
` Dismissing all of them as coincidence would then defy logic.`
`I don't believe in curses.`
` But... Every single year, on the day of the Watanagashi, somebody or something 'makes' it happen...`
` Without fail...`
`The woman chuckled again, as if she picked up on what I was thinking.`
`It felt like she was saying, "Maybe there was. Maybe we frightened him." Stuff like that.`
`I felt embarrassed at being read so easily. I pressed Tomitake-san to continue, a bit of impatience and irritation in my tone.`
`"Then?`
` So someone died the next year, right...?`
` Who was it that time?"`
`"I wonder...`
` ...`
` Who do you think, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"Th... The hell!?"`
`The way he said it didn't agree with me. The sarcastic tone ticked me off.`
`"Don't avoid the question...! I'm serious here...!"`
`"Hey, hey. Calm down, Keiichi-kun."`
`I realized when she tried to calm me down that I had been panicking.`
`"We aren't trying to avoid the question, Keiichi-kun.`
` It's just... When you say 'the next year,' that's..."`
`"That's today."`
`When Tomitake-san hesitated to say it, she finished for him.`
`...I broke into a cold sweat. I really didn't like the direction this was headed.`
`"Nobody wants to speak of it, but they all think it's going to happen again tonight."`
`"Th-The festival was so cheerful, though!!"`
`"Well, the victim last year, the housewife... She was a non-believer.`
` It turns out she didn't even attend the Watanagashi festival."`
`"There was a rumor going around that if you didn't participate in the festival, you would incur Oyashiro-sama's wrath.`
` ...Didn't you hear anything about this, Keiichi-kun?"`
`I never even heard a whisper of that rumor.`
`"...Th-Then the reason everyone was at the festival was... they were afraid of the curse!?"`
`"I figured that must have been the reason...`
` ...There were a lot more people at the Watanagashi than usual."`
`"I guess everyone was... just afraid after all.`
` Of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`"...."`
`I couldn't utter a single word...`
`In this modern age.`
`Where we've made progress in all scientific fields, shedding light on the unknown and misunderstood.`
`Where black and white television has been eradicated and we've sent men to the moon.`
`Even with all of our accomplishments...`
` This can exist in modern society?`
`"Tons of invitations were sent out to neighboring towns' youth groups to help pad the numbers.`
` But after that string of events, few decided to join.`
`The municipal committee members were complaining about how hard it was to gather participants."`
`"Also, the police are treating each case as isolated; they don't believe they're connected.`
` ...But apparently they sent quite a few plainclothes officers for security."`
`It finally began to dawn on me why Rena and Mion were reluctant to talk.`
`If nothing happened during this Watanagashi, everything would have been over with and I'd be none the wiser.`
`...If nothing happened, all would be well.`
` In that case, it would all end up being just crazy talk.`
`I should have just pretended like I knew nothing from the beginning.`
` Then they wouldn't have had to act like nothing happened.`
`...And we would have all gotten back to life as usual.`
`"...Maybe it was just too much for him, after all."`
`The woman ran her fingers through her hair as she sighed.`
`"N-No... It wasn't,`
` not at all..."`
`I had tried to act strong, but that just served to emphasize how much the information had unsettled me.`
`After seeing how I looked, Tomitake-san appeared to regret saying anything.`
`Letting out a sigh, he then spoke, forcing an awkward, upbeat demeanor.`
`"Keiichi-kun, surely you don't believe in such things as curses."`
`"...Well... no..."`
`"If the causes of all of the crimes were unknown, with the perpetrators and their methods all mysteries, then I'd concede the possibility of a curse.`
`But that's not how things are in reality.`
` Police investigations have already uncovered the truth and perpetrators for all of the cases."`
`Hearing him say "police" made me feel a lot better.`
`It was perfect for repelling the word "curse."`
`"...The first one, the dismemberment, for example.`
` I told you, didn't I?`
` All but one of the perpetrators were arrested.`
` It's only a matter of time for the last one.`
` The motive turned out to have been an argument they had while intoxicated. `
`That's no curse.`
` ...Don't you agree?"`
`That was true. If it didn't happen on the day of the Watanagashi, then I wouldn't think it was related to the curse at all...`
`"The accidental deaths of the couple who supported the dam is the same.`
` He was in a position that made others hate him. The police made a point of investigating from that angle.`
` They concluded it was an accident. `
`Not foul play."`
`"But they both happened on the day of the festival, right...?"`
`"Ha ha ha.`
` Just think about it, Keiichi-kun.`
` Do you think people with a lot of enemies here in Hinamizawa could participate easily in a local festival?`
`It would be especially hard for them to be around during the Watanagashi.`
`So they probably left Hinamizawa intentionally around this time of year to travel, don't you think?"`
`It wasn't a very clear explanation, but I sort of understood what Tomitake-san was getting at.`
`So I pressed on earnestly, asking more questions so that I could convince myself.`
`"Then, Tomitake-san, what about the priest who died after that?`
` The one with the unknown illness.`
` ...That also happened on the day of the festival."`
`"It's even easier to explain what happened to the Shinto priest.`
` The Watanagashi is a really big event that happens once a year. It was probably from all the built-up stress. `
`Or it may have been because of a pre-existing condition."`
`"But it was an unknown illness.`
` It's hard to believe such a thing could exist with all our advances in medicine..."`
`"It's just an exaggeration.`
` Rumors making rumors.`
`Anyone would get worked up over having incidents happen two years in a row.`
` The sudden death is quite unnatural, though...`
`Of course, the police ordered an autopsy because of the strange way he died.`
` ...But there wasn't enough for them to open a full investigation, you know?`
` Turns out it was just a sudden death due to illness."`
`"...The priest's wife committed suicide, correct?`
` What about that?"`
`"I believe I already explained that.`
` Everyone was shaken up by the incidents happening for a third year.`
` Those who are of strong faith were quick to believe it was the work of the curse. `
`...Of course, that included the priest's wife.`
`Apparently they found a suicide note that said something like:`
` ...`
` 'My death will quell Oyashiro-sama's anger.'"`
`"Well, then, how about... the next incident, with the housewife?`
` That happened on the day of the Watanagashi too!"`
`"The perpetrator has already been caught and the case has been closed.`
` Turns out it was just some nutjob trying to continue the legacy of the Hinamizawa curse."`
`"Then... Then...! ...How about the incident the next year!?`
` ...Oh, uh..."`
`Oh, yeah. This year is the next year.`
`Tomitake-san gave a hearty laugh.`
`"Nothing will happen.`
` Not this year.`
` ...There was never a curse to begin with.`
` It's just that a group of people believed it was the explanation for a string of coincidences."`
`...My internal computer finally got itself back on track.`
`I felt a bit embarrassed by how childish I'd become after losing control and panicking.`
`"I can see very clearly now that Keiichi-kun really does love Hinamizawa.`
` Even if Oyashiro-sama's curse actually did exist,`
` I can't imagine that Keiichi-kun would become a target."`
`I felt very relieved.`
`I should probably just forget everything I heard tonight.`
`I'll greet Rena and Mion tomorrow with the same smile as always.`
`They'd probably also like tonight to end without incident, so they can continue on tomorrow without having worried me.`
`Perhaps seeing my change in attitude, the woman who had been listening in stretched as she got up from the rock she was sitting on.`
`"...Well, then.`
` I should be getting back."`
`"Goodness! I think I may have gone on a bit too long!"`
`There were so few people compared to the crowd from before. I could only make out a few groups of families enjoying the cool evening air.`
`I looked at my watch; it seemed we'd talked for the better part of an hour.`
`"Didn't you come along with your friends, Keiichi-kun?`
` Not going to look for them?"`
`"...Oh, yeah...!`
` They might all be looking for me!"`
`"Heheheheh!`
` You're quite the scoundrel, making the girls look for you."`
`"See you, Keiichi-kun. Have a nice night.`
` ...You too, Jirou-san. I'll see you a bit later."`
`...Tomitake-san seems to be quite the scoundrel himself. (So his name is Jirou...)`
`After dusting off her backside, she disappeared into the crowd of people still busy cleaning up the shrine grounds.`
`"Keiichi-kun~!!`
` So sorry~!!"`
`In her place, Rena came running over.`
`I could see all the others behind her.`
`Speak of the devil.`
`"My bad, Kei-chan...!`
` We got so caught up in our discussion!"`
`I'd completely forgotten about them while caught up in my own conversation, so we were even.`
`"My, so Tomitake-san was with you!`
` This works out perfectly!!"`
`"We still need to settle the shooting gallery competition."`
`"Ah, th-that's right...!`
` So I guess I'm gonna end up dead last?"`
`In the end, after my dramatic victory, Rika-chan was the last challenger. But there weren't many targets left.`
`The ones remaining were all tiny and difficult to hit.`
`She did take her time and aim, but all three shots completely missed. She was to end up sharing the loser's crown with Tomitake-san.`
`...However, she did her little meeping cry in front of the owner, and he turned to mush instantly.`
`She was given a pack of gum as a consolation prize.`
`Her methods were a bit audacious, but she did avoid being the loser rather magnificently.`
`"...Come to think of it, Rika-chan is quite the trickster."`
`"I have no idea what Keiichi is talking about."`
`"Now then! It's decided that Tomitake-san is dead last~!!!"`
`Everyone cheered and applauded. Tomitake-san smiled wryly, slightly bewildered.`
`"So~ Tomitake-san, are you ready? Penalty time!!"`
`"Huh? Oh, I completely forgot about that!!"`
`You're too naive, Tomitake-san. This is why you've got to avoid losing in our club...`
`Mion pulled a felt-tip marker from her pocket.`
` ...Oh, it's that.`
`"Show him some mercy, Mion.`
` At lease use a washable marker.`
` A permanent one is too harsh."`
`"Ahaha, it just has to be permanent.`
` Water-based marker would come off in the laundry."`
`"Whoa, whoa! What is this!?`
` Please take it easy on me!!"`
`All of us pinned his arms behind his back and Mion approached him with the marker in one hand.`
`"Aaand squip, squip, squip!"`
`But she didn't write on Tomitake-san's face... She wrote on the shirt he was wearing.`
`"You'd better have your big break this year! -Mion"`
`Rena took up the marker next. "Show me your photos next time, okay?☆ -Rena"`
`It was a little heartwarming, and I just had to laugh.`
`"Haha, this is more like a farewell card than a penalty."`
`"Ho ho ho! I'm not as soft as the rest!`
` I'll make sure this is a proper penalty!"`
`"Haha~ dead last! -Satoko"`
`"Try harder next time. -Rika"`
`"Here you go, Keiichi-san."`
`I couldn't decide what to write, but based on what kind of penalty this was... this was probably the most appropriate.`
`"Come back and play again. -Keiichi"`
`Tomitake-san was silent the entire time.`
`At first he was quite bewildered, but now he had a different look on his face.`
`"So I have to wear this all the way back to Tokyo as part of the penalty?"`
`"Of course! You'd better wear it all the way home~!"`
`"Ahahaha, you could wear it when you come back.`
` It would be nice!"`
`He appeared deeply moved.`
`Embarrassment mixed with a wealth of other emotions made him turn a bright red.`
`"Understood. I'll wear this the next time I come here.`
` I promise!"`
`Everyone cheered and applauded.`
`It was the finest parting gift possible for a buddy heading out tonight.`
`I saw the woman who was with Tomitake-san standing near the festival grounds.`
`It seemed Tomitake-san noticed her too, and knew it was time to leave.`
`"Seems like your guest is waiting~!`
` Isn't it about time?`
` Hmm~?"`
`"Yeah,`
` that's certainly how it seems... haha."`
`Tomitake-san headed off towards her and seemed to apologize for making her wait.`
`We all shouted stuff at Tomitake-san.`
`Each time we did, he looked back and waved his hand.`
`...Eventually, he faded into the darkness of the night, out of sight.`
`It was quite the casual farewell.`
`This wasn't the first time any of us had seen someone off.`
`They had done the same thing many times before.`
`"...He's gone."`
`"Well, it's about time we take off too!"`
`Rika-chan had to stay behind with the other committee members, since they were having a meeting. Satoko was tagging along with her.`
`I headed back home with the usual suspects.`
`The walk back was quite lively, with talk of the day's war stories.`
`Should have done this, should have done that, that kind of stuff.`
`Rena and I parted ways with Mion, and then it was just the two of us.`
`Then we got to my house and I parted ways with Rena as well.`
`"It's already pretty late. Are you alright by yourself?"`
`"Yeah, I'm perfectly fine!`
` It's close. I'm going to run, too."`
`"...If you run into some weirdo, just yell."`
`"If I do shout... will you come and save me, maybe? ...Maybe?"`
`"If I hear you."`
`"Hau...!`
` ...O-Okay!`
` I'll scream loud enough so you can hear me!"`
`Merrily spinning her arms around at high speed, Rena dashed off.`
`She was fine. In that mode, not even an adult could stand against her.`
`Rena's cheerful presence disappeared and it finally became quiet again.`
`The curse that not a soul mentioned, even under their breath.`
` ...The more I learned about it tonight, the more unsettling it became.`
`It didn't show on any of their faces, but they were probably all quite concerned about it as well...`
`But if nothing happens tonight, then it all ends up being just crazy talk.`
`Nothing will happen. Nothing bad, nothing at all.`
`"What's wrong, Keiichi? Why are you standing in a place like that?`
` Come inside. You'll catch a cold."`
`It was my mom.`
`"Did you go, Mom?`
` To the Watanagashi festival?"`
`"In the end your father didn't wake up,`
` so I missed it.`
` A little disappointing."`
`Mom stuck her tongue out with a bit of an embarrassed look on her face.`
