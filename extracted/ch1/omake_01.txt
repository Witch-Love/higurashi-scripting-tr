`"Thank you for buying Higurashi When They Cry ~Onikakushi~,`
` a visual novel by 07th Expansion!`
` How was it?`
` If you enjoyed it, even a little bit, it would make me happy."`
`"Even a little bit is stretching it!`
` That incredibly dark ending made me angry, you know?"`
`"...Made us angry."`
`"How could the prologue... have such an incredibly dark ending?"`
`"Yeah, but doesn't that happen sometimes?`
`"With one strange event happening after another, I got totally lost... what exactly is Oyashiro-sama's curse about?`
` Actually, what is Oyashiro-sama to begin with? They didn't explain it much."`
`"...Hmmmm, I haven't heard much about it.`
` But... I have kind of a bad feeling about it."`
`"...It feels like it'll be another one of those scary stories where somebody gets cursed again."`
`"Tough luck for Kei-chan~!`
` What kind of curse is he gonna get hit with this time?"`
`"However, I am looking forward to seeing what kind of story it's going to be!"`
`"Sorry for being late, my bad, my bad."`
`"Hey everybody!`
` Good work today!"`
`"Same to you~!!`
` Huh? Where's Kei-chan?"`
`"Keiichi-kun is already off reading the script for the next chapter.`
` It must be hard being the main character!"`
`"...Huh...`
` That's too bad.`
` He could have at least poked in to say hello."`
`"In any case, that story really was a lot of trouble, especially for Keiichi-kun and Rena-chan!"`
`"Trouble? That was the mother of all Bad Ends!"`
`"I wonder... What was the identity of the thing that attacked Keiichi-kun?"`
`"My theory is that it was the work of people made to look like a curse."`
`"...But Keiichi made that mysterious phone call at his demise."`
`"Yeah.`
` I also thought that call was strange.`
`At that point, Kei-chan should have been certain that the culprits were people."`
`"...That really was a strange phone call.`
` It almost sounded like he was being chased by a ghost or something."`
`"Just from that phone call... it really makes me think that it was the work of a curse after all."`
`"Since we're all here, why don't we all share our theories?`
` Let's start with Sonozaki-san."`
`"I absolutely believe it was people!`
`I think it was a man-made incident that was just imitating the strange folklore floating around Hinamizawa!"`
`"Certainly.`
` Every year, on the day of the festival, for another link in the chain of mysterious deaths to happen certainly is suspicious."`
`"That so-called chain of mysterious deaths, it has to be somebody trying to reenact the folklore! Definitely!"`
`"I think it was the curse!!`
`Looking at the scene were Keiichi-san went berserk in the entryway, and the last scene with the phone call, those cannot be explained with a human culprit."`
`"When you say it that way...`
` It really wasn't the type of scene that would make you think it was the work of an actual person."`
`"...Yeah, but even then... I still think it was a person who did it.`
`That last scene and the one with the entryway, I think that the stress must have driven him into paranoid delusions."`
`"You aren't helping me to understand by using such complicated words!!"`
`"...In other words, Keiichi was so scared that he was imagining things."`
`"Then, then, thennnnn... what was the meaning behind that scene...? What exactly was that mysterious presence behind Keiichi!?"`
`"A red herring. R-e-d H-e-r-r-i-n-g."`
`"Mii-chan, what do you mean by a red herring?"`
`"Like old man Tomitake here said, that scene was the result of Kei-chan having a stress-induced delusion from being mentally cornered.`
`The overly graphic depiction was a ploy to make the player think it was a curse.`
` That's why it was a red herring!"`
`"Wh-When you say it like that... hmmmmmm... but, but..."`
`"Hahaha, well it just means that there's that possibility."`
`"In that case... the theory that Ooishi-san proposed during the story that it was a conspiracy by the villagers was correct?`
`What does the man himself have to say about that?"`
`"Me?`
` Ahahaha...`
` Hmmm...`
` It makes you think, eh?"`
`"Huh?`
` I totally thought that Ooishi-san would be behind the 'people' explanation."`
`"...During the story, I said it was definitely the work of people. But if a person really was to blame, that leaves a lot of loose ends."`
`"Like what?`
` Let us hear what Detective Ooishi-san's theory is!"`
`"First of all, if a human is the culprit, then there has to be a motive...`
` In other words, somebody has to gain something from it."`
`"So what you mean is, if this was the work of people, there would have to be something gained from causing the chain of mysterious deaths?"`
`"Exactly.`
` I felt that somebody could have benefited from the deaths of people related to the dam development, but the recent victims weren't related to that at all.`
`...First off, who benefits from killing Maebara-san?"`
`"I see.`
` If you say it like that, my case is kind of weak too..."`
`"I mean, none of your money was stolen.`
` There's no way it was human culprits!"`
`"But that's not everything there is to it, right?`
`Like Mii-chan just said, there might have been some sort of reason for them to reenact the folklore..."`
`"Exactly!`
` This wasn't a murder where you consider the typical motives.`
` It makes me think that this was most likely... some sort of ritualistic murder to reenact the blood-stained history of the village!"`
`"...So I'll ask the question of the hour, who gains from this reenactment...?"`
`"It's not about simple benefit... it's a more psychological reason.`
` I think... that maybe this was an act of revenge.`
` Something native to the region...`
` Some connection not touched on this time around!"`
`"Then what is it? It couldn't be that you're leaning towards the 'curse' explanation, Ooishi-san?"`
`"That's right, that's right!!`
` The man playing the detective said so!`
` It's decided! It was a curse!!"`
`"If, as Maebara-san said during the story, it was the case that Oyashiro-sama possessed Ryuugu-san and Sonozaki-san and committed those acts... `
`That would fit the evidence the most.`
` As much as I hate to say it."`
`"Ummm... Actually, I'm of the same opinion as Ooishi-san.`
` I can't come up with any other explanation for the normally-kind Rena and Mii-chan to suddenly start acting strange like that."`
`"...About that`
`...`
` It may sound strange coming from the person herself, but I think that I, Mion, did it."`
`"...I don't get what Mii is saying.`
` I'd like an explanation."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` In other words...`
` I think this may end up being a really cruel story."`
`"Huh... Wait, Mii-chan...`
` You don't mean..."`
`"Taking the human culprit theory to its logical conclusion, that's how it would seem...`
` I also have my suspicions."`
`"In other words, Ryuugu-san and Sonozaki-san both actually had those personalities to begin with, and were merely deceiving Maebara-san...`
` Am I right?"`
`"I don't like that at all!!!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
` This is all the curse's fault!`
` Rena-san and Mion-san and everybody else are all kind, nice people!!!!"`
`"I-I think that too!`
` I think that Rena and Mion-chan are really good people at heart.`
` ...I think that during the story, they must have been possessed by something."`
`"So Rena also thinks it was a curse.`
` Then let me ask everybody who thinks it was a curse...`
` There has to be a reason for a curse, right?`
` It doesn't make sense for a curse to just indiscriminately befall someone. `
`Can somebody explain that?"`
`"A curse is a curse!`
` Human logic won't get us anywhere!"`
`"Ahaha, Satoko-chan.`
` A personified deity is, in the end, nothing more than the creation of people.`
` That's why their method of thinking is also understandable to humans.`
` Just take a look at the Greek Pantheon. `
`They cry, get angry, get jealous... basically, they're just like humans."`
`"Uhh... So what you're saying is that Oyashiro-sama is cursing people with some benefit in mind?"`
`"That's an odd way of putting it, but basically, yes."`
`"That's why they say: Far from Jupiter, far from his thunder.`
` Ahaha, you do have a point."`
`"...Basically, it doesn't matter if it's Oyashiro-sama, or humans, there has to be a reason."`
`"But Rika,`
` what if that reason isn't clear?"`
`"...I don't know."`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` That's right.`
` This is still just the prologue.`
` There's still a lot of stuff that hasn't been revealed yet."`
`"Yeah.`
` It's hard to come up with any more theories at this point."`
`"Nooo!`
` I won't be satisfied until this is all made clear!"`
`"Mion-san seems rather particular about this."`
`"Ahahaha!`
` We'll just make the best with what we know!!`
` Doesn't this feel interesting? Like the club a little bit?"`
`"Ah, yeah!`
` If you put it that way, it does seem interesting!"`
`"Well then, let's summarize.`
` Let's see, I think it was a curse.`
` Tomitake-kun thinks it was people, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll go with it being people."`
`"I also agree with the 'people' explanation!`
` That's not to say I hate such fantastic things like curses.`
` But in this particular case, the connection to a curse is a little weak~."`
`"Two for the 'people' explanation then.`
` Ryuugu-san was on the 'curse' side of things, right?"`
`"Yup.`
` Satoko-chan and I believe it was a curse.`
` Right~?"`
`"Yeah!`
` I think it was a curse!`
` People who say that Rena-san and Mion-san were evil to begin with are more befitting of a curse!!"`
`"Well...`
` I don't want to believe that my own personality was that twisted.`
` But I have to keep a cool head when I'm in Club Mode!`
` If I base my choice on just emotion, I'll regret it, you know~?"`
`"Well now...`
` It doesn't really matter which side you pick, does it?"`
`"Huh? Rika-chan hasn't said anything yet.`
` What do you think?"`
`"...I don't think that Oyashiro-sama is a bad god."`
`"Huh, that's an interesting opinion."`
`"...I don't want to worship some bad god that just curses people.`
` I'd like a generous god more than one that curses."`
`"That's right, Rika-chan is a shrine maiden...!`
` Yup. Good opinion."`
`"Then what?`
` If Rika-chan doesn't believe that it was Oyashiro-sama...`
` then do you think the perpetrators were human after all!?"`
`"...We'll just go with that.☆"`
`"Well now...`
` That means the votes are split right down the middle!`
` So half of us think it was a curse, and half of us think it was people?"`
`"Rena-chan, just for reference,`
` what did the test players who played the beta version think?"`
`"Hmmm.`
` Yeah.`
` There were a lot more players who believed in the 'people' explanation!"`
`"See, see, right there!`
` Our veteran comrades are cool, collected, and very observant!"`
`"...But the beta version only finished partway through the story."`
`"That's right.`
` Even the people who played the beta might change their minds if they got through to the very end."`
`"What should we do then?`
` This means that the opinions are still split.`
` It's no fun if we don't settle this!"`
`"We need there to be an odd number of judges, in other words:`
` We need one more opinion!"`
`"Ah, perfect timing then.`
` Why don't we ask Keiichi-kun himself?`
` Let's call him!"`
`"...The opinion of the victim himself is very valuable."`
`"Since that's decided, it's time for the phone!"`
`"Hello, Keiichi-kun?`
` It's Rena.`
` Are you busy with work right now?"`
`"Yeah, really busy.`
` Just when I thought I'd get a break because the chapter's over, it's already time for the next one!"`
`"How's Kei-chan?`
` Busy?"`
`"Yeah.`
` He's moping."`
`"I can hear you, you know!!`
` It must be nice having a wrap-up party!`
` I wanted to go too!!!"`
`"Ah, sorry about that, Keiichi-kun.`
` Anyways, during the current chapter,`
` Keiichi-kun,`
` didn't you`
`...`
` die?`
` We were just talking about who the culprit might be."`
`"Basically, we're deadlocked on whether it was people or Oyashiro-sama's curse that killed you."`
`"I'm really sorry!`
` Even though you're busy reviewing the script...`
` Keiichi-kun, which do you think it was?"`
`"That's obvious, isn't it?"`
`"Which?"`
`"Isn't it both of them!?`
` Targeted by suspicious people from the village, and then cursed by some strange Oyashiro-sama on top of that!`
` It's both humans and a curse!!!`
` Everybody's just picking on me!!!!"`
`"...So very, very, pitiful.`
` Next time, I'll give you a good patting on the head."`
`"In the end, the opinion's still split, huh."`
`"I'll think this over again.`
` We might have missed something."`
`"Well then, please look forward to the next release, 'Higurashi When They Cry ~Watanagashi~'!"`
