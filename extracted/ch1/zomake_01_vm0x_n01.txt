`"Ahaha!`
` This ~Onikakushi~ chapter is the first story that readers challenging the mystery of the entire series get to experience.`
` So it's actually supposed to be somewhat of a prologue."`
`The player digging through the story in order to avoid a bad ending is the point of these types of games after all."`
`"...It's still just the first chapter. I'm looking forward to the next one."`
`"Just what kind of plot awaits us from here on?`
` Rena, do you know?"`
`"Yeah.`
` This episode has Rena as your closest friend,`
` but it seems like there are stories featuring Mii-chan and Satoko-chan, too.`
`"What kind of plot developments can we expect from the other scenarios?"`
`"In this chapter, they introduced the string of mysterious deaths that were happening in Hinamizawa recently, right?`
` The next chapter will introduce some of the history of Hinamizawa."`
`"...He probably had too many lines in his script, and had to stay behind recording."`
`"Well, you can hardly blame him.`
`ã€€Maebara-san has enough lines to cover a full cast in a normal novel game, you see~`
` hehehehe!"`
`"I see.`
` A member of some repressed family looking to air out an old grudge of their ancestors... something like that?`
` Hmmm... I don't like that."`
`"...You can come if you get some character art for yourself."`
`"Rika, that's a secret..."`
` Everybody's just picking on me!!!!"`
