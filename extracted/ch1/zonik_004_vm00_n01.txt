` Se...`
`"They say he enjoys peeping into bathrooms."`
`HaouUuh!?`
`"Is it true that he's going around every night stealing panties?"`
`Who were they talking about!?`
`"I heard he wears panties on his head and smells them and stuff."`
`No way I would do thaaat!!`
`"I heard that Class Representative Mion was a victim too~!"`
`"Did you hear?`
` I heard that the new transfer student Maebara-san is a really perverted person!`
` Kyahahahaha!!"`
`"Yeah! It's not even in the same league as jumbo jets!`
` What fell on Rena's house...`
`Was a space colony!!"`
`"A-A space colonyyyyy!?"`
`"Yeah, it's a really big disaster!`
` Everything in a 100 kilometer radius was obliterated!`
` But that's only the prelude to this tragic tale!!`
` This is the beginning... the start of a war for independence by the Propagandapality of Zeon!!"`
`The lower grades were dumbfounded, their eyes like saucers at the grand turn of events...`
`"Wh... What will happen...?`
` Will the Terran Federation lose?"`
`"If things go on like this, they will!!`
` Only one person can defeat the Red Comet!!`
` That person is Rena Ryuugu!!"`
`The lower grade students all gulped...!`
`"But... I thought even the Terran Federation's Impulse Wave Diffusal Cannon... didn't work on the Comet Empire..."`
`"You're close. That's the white variety of those comets.`
` The reason it didn't work was because they didn't know the weak point.`
` Of course, Rena knows their weak point all too well!"`
`"What are you all saying!?`
` I can't control a mech!"`
`I had agreed to meet with Rena to dig Colonel Sanders out of that mountain of treasure from before.`
`If they come to dump again illegally, he'll be buried completely and it'll be impossible to dig him out, `
`and if that happens... Rena will undoubtedly go after the Colonel Sanders in front of the fried chicken place in town.`
`"Wh-What was that all about!?`
` She was walking around with a bared axe!`
` And she was laughing with a huge smile across her face!!"`
`Well, it certainly would be quite the spectacle for a girl of her age to be roaming around with a axe.`
`Somebody gallivanting about while waving a axe around certainly would seem dangerous.`
`"You should put a cover on that axe when you have it in public.`
` It's not good to carry it around out in the open like that!"`
`She's probably the only person who could carry a axe around Hinamizawa and not be considered suspicious...`
`I took the axe from Rena and made my way up the unstable slope.`
`"Just wait, Colonel Sanders.`
` Keiichi-kun will save you...â˜†"`
`First of all, I'd never used a axe before.`
`"I'm fine!`
` I'm almost there.`
` I'll make sure Rena can give Colonel Sanders a good-night kiss tonight."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...Thanks.`
` ...Giving Colonel Sanders... a good night kiss... hau..."`
`With a bit of a wry smile on my face, I grabbed the handle of the axe and headed back to worksite.`
`I had swung the axe countless times today, just like this.`
` Contact.`
` Shards of wood splintered.`
`The weight I put behind the axe not only split through the beam, but smashed the statue's shoulder as well.`
`You're pretty lucky, Colonel Sanders. Your new master is a pretty decent person.`
`"...Waa... Colonel Sanders... He really is kyute!"`
`And so Jack and Jill went down the hill, carrying a human-sized bag and an unsheathed axe!`
`"I do know...!!`
` I do know!!`
` I do know!!!...`
` ...`
`Se..."`
`"...They still haven't found one of the arms."`
`I laughed dryly at how pathetic I was for considering the arm flopping down and rolling to my feet to be such a bad omen.`
