`<The Houjou Family>`
`Every year, Oyashiro-sama's curse claims two victims.`
`This means that with four years in a row, there have been eight now, but it's worthwhile to note half of them have been members of this family.`
`Note: The curse on the second year, a certain falling accident, involved the death of Houjou, a dam proponent, and the disappearance of his wife. `
`(She was pronounced dead the following year after being considered to have vanished under perilous circumstances.)`
`The curse on the fourth year involved the death of the Houjou sibling's aunt, who was then their foster mother, and the disappearance of the elder brother.`
`The Houjou family is a poor one, and it's hard to say Mr. Houjou's job went very well.`
`Apparently, upon reemployment via family connections, there was a plan for them to return to the home of the mother's side of the family.`
`For Mr. Houjou, the eviction due to the Hinamizawa dam project and the payment of a large amount of compensation money was essentially a windfall.`
`Mr. Houjou actively embraced the Ministry of Construction's negotiations from an early stage and was selected as representative of the dam proponents.`
`It was rumored he had been bought out by the Ministry of Construction for doing so, but the truth is unknown.`
`However, the dam's proponents were in the vastly outnumbered minority.`
`In addition, as the Sonozaki family strengthened its own foundation and promised support against the dam, all of the proponents save for Mr. Houjou switched over to the anti-dam side.`
`At this point, Hinamizawa was completely united against the dam, and Mr. Houjou was held up to ridicule as a stooge of the dam project's proponents.`
`He was, essentially, used as a scapegoat for the anti-dam coalition.`
`In the end, the dam project collapsed with Oyashiro-sama's curse and the dismemberment incident.`
`However, punishment towards the bitter enemies supporting the dam project continues to this day...`
`There are not many left today who supported the dam project, nor who had a negative reputation at the time.`
`If there were any candidates left for the curse, it's the husband of the housewife who was beaten to death last year, Teppei Houjou.`
` And Mr. Houjou's daughter, Satoko Houjou.`
`Strangely, these two are the only candidates left.`
`Will this year's curse come down on the two of them...?`
`There is more than enough value in observing them both...`
