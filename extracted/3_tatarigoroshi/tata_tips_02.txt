`I could see Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun walking over to the gym storehouse.`
`They needed to get the bag of lime used to make the lines on the court for our next gym class.`
`They were on duty today, after all.`
`But... in that storehouse... a terrible trap was awaiting them...!!`
`"...Being on this side of the trap for once... is really thrilling!"`
`"Ho-ho-ho!`
` If you realize that is the true pleasure in setting up traps, then you have the potential yourself, Keiichi-san!"`
`The two of them fumbled around with the gym storehouse's lock.`
`......Oh?`
` What's this?`
`Okamura-kun pointed at part of the door and started whispering to Tomita-kun.`
`Then, realizing something, they both jumped away from the door.`
`"Oh... Satoko, I think they found out!`
` Did we mess up?!"`
`"...I had calculated that they would notice the trap at the entrance.`
` And, of course, I've calculated what action they will take now.`
` Ho-ho-ho..."`
`According to Satoko... after they noticed the suspicious trap on the door, they would go around and try to get in through the back window.`
`And just as she'd prophesized... they went around to the back...`
` and just as she'd prophesized, they climbed up... opened the window and tried to sneak in...`
`"...Wow... amazing...`
` Everything's exactly like you said...!!`
` ......Ah!`
` It got them!!!"`
`Boof,`
` poooooooooooooooof!!`
`An explosion of pure white lime burst out of the window.`
`...After a few moments, the two of them managed to crawl away from the window... both of them completely white.`
`"Ho-ho-ho!`
` Ohh-ho-ho-ho!!!`
` This is the moment I live for~!`
` It tastes like honey~!!"`
`"...But still...`
` ...That was some trap...`
` You would have had to know everything to set something like that up:`
` where they'd put their hands, their legs, where they'd jump down...?!"`
`"Listen carefully, Keiichi-san.`
` The first step to making a trap is to watch and observe the victim!`
`You must scrupulously predict their movement patterns—how they'll move at any given moment!`
` If you do that, then you can achieve the greatest possible results with only the most minimal trap!"`
`...Come to think of it, before Satoko read the final move at that final moment earlier, Mion had given her high praise, saying she had the makings of a genius.`
`"So it's all about reading the opponent.`
` ...So then, the traps you've caught me in before—they worked because you figured out everything I'd do?"`
`"Yes.`
` I can see right through all your actions, and that's how I set them up!`
` So if one day you suddenly started having different habits and behavior, I wouldn't be able to anymore."`
`...Bragging that she could anticipate everything I'd do...`
` ...That was kind of mean.`
`"Okay, then.`
` Let's play a game now.`
` I want to test whether your predictions are accurate."`
`"Yes, that is fine with me.`
` Keiichi-san, you are particularly easy to get a read on—I could do it before breakfast!`
` Ohh-ho-ho-ho!!"`
`When we went back to the classroom, Satoko tore off pieces of paper and wrote something on the back of them, making three cards.`
`Of course, I didn't know what she'd written.`
`"Please, pick one of these cards, Keiichi-san.`
` If you do not pick one that says 'you're a loser,' you will win."`
`"Great, you're on!!`
` The club has built up my sensitivity to this stuff, so I'll smash right through your predictions!"`
`Satoko smirks and holds out the three cards.`
`Set your mind to full power by calming it, Keiichi Maebara!`
` ...Cool and collected is how you'll win!`
`......If I don't pick the losing one, I'll win.`
`...Which means if I do pick it, Satoko will win.`
`......In other words, Satoko wants to make me pick the losing one.`
`What would she do... to make sure I picked the losing one?`
`Could she even predict something like that?!`
`Statistically speaking, isn't there some rule... that says I'm more likely to pick the one in the middle, or the ones on either side...?!`
`And then... it hits me like a flash—this is what Mion would do!`
`"Now, which one will you pick?"`
`"I've made my decision.`
` ...And it is......`
` this ooonnneeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Huh?`
` Ahhh!!`
` W-What are you doing?!"`
`I steal all three cards from Satoko's hands!`
`I predicted what Satoko would do in advance.`
`...Satoko wanted to make sure I picked the losing one.`
`Which meant... all three of these were losing ones!!`
`"And that's how I knew!!`
` Allow me to look at all three!!!"`
`I flip all three cards face-up... and, on each one, there is a single word.`
`"You're"`
` "A"`
` "Loser"`
`"...What is this?`
` ...You're... a... loser.`
` ...Huh?"`
`"It means just what it says.`
` ...If you had only chosen one, you wouldn't have lost."`
`"What... whaaaaaat?!`
` T-Then... you predicted... that I'd draw all threeeeeeee?!`
` Gyaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`I held my head in my hands and fainted as Satoko reveled at the might of her abilities!`
`Her shrill laughter echoed throughout the classroom.`
`And then, there was a poof as lime powder came down upon Satoko's head.`
`I looked to see Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun, all in white, dumping a whole bag of lime powder on her, getting their revenge.`
`"Well, excuuuuse me!!`
` Would you happen to have any proof?`
` And I'd like it if you didn't call it something so inelegant—a trick!`
` I would prefer you call it something more refined:`
` a`
` trap`
`♪`
` please!"`
`"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!!`
` K-K-Keiichi-san, h-help meee!!"`
`...Our underclassmen crashed around the classroom in furious combat, getting white lime everywhere.`
`...Hey, Satoko?`
` ...Why couldn't you see this coming, exactly?`
`At the time, I hadn't seen something coming too, though: the teacher coming to me afterward and giving us all a stern talking to...`
