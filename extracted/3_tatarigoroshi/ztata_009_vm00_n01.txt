`"Hey, excuse me.`
` You're from Hinamizawa, right?"`
`"......Yes, why?"`
`I've... seen this person around a few times.`
`...Right, I remembered.`
`...His name, I think, was Tomitake, a freelance photographer who lived in Tokyo.`
` He would zealously visit Hinamizawa every season to take pictures... or so Mion and the others told me, I think.`
`"I'm Tomitake.`
` A freelance photographer.`
` I specialize in wild birds and landscapes.`
` I'm still pretty unknown, though."`
`It seemed absurd for him to introduce himself when I was just showing him to the shrine, but he gave me his name, so I needed to give mine back.`
`"I'm Maebara.`
` ...Pleased to meet you, I guess."`
`"Maebara-kun?`
` Pleased to meet you!"`
`He seemed like a pretty silly man... but that felt kind of good considering I'd been suffocating with worry over Satoko all night.`
`"Let's leave it at that, Maebara-kun.`
` ...If, well... If it's true that she's being abused by her uncle, then I can't leave it alone."`
`"I'd contact the prefecture's child consultation center.`
` You said just now that I would be turned away, didn't you? `
`Child welfare officers can bring the police with them if the situation demands.`
` They will not submit to intimidation."`
