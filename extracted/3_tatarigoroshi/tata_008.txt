`"...Is Houjou-san staying home today too?`
` Furude-san, do you know anything?"`
`The teacher's voice wasn't critical... but Rika-chan hung her head, unable to answer, and I felt really bad for her...`
`The teacher called Rika-chan up and they had an exchange in hushed tones at the dais.`
`At first Rika-chan said that Satoko's fever had grown worse, but everyone in class knew it was a lie.`
`...Because... every day, Rika-chan brought Satoko's bento with her.`
`"...Satoko-chan... I wonder what happened."`
`"Don't ask me..."`
`...I'm the one... who wants to know most of all.`
`It was already the third day since Satoko's first absence.`
`Ever since then... I haven't felt good.`
`Until just last Sunday, everything had been so much fun...`
`I had reached out to Satoko like a real older brother... and we spent that time quietly, but warm and comfortable.`
`...So why had it suddenly been... flipped over...?`
`The more I thought about it...`
`the more I thought that the world had taken a turn for the worse ever since Ooishi arrived.`
`Thinking on it now... maybe the strange apprehensions plaguing me the night before Ooishi arrived had been a sign...`
`...Kuraudo Ooishi... Oyashiro-sama's servant...`
`"...Shit, that's impossible...`
` They can't decide Satoko will be the curse victim this year just 'cause he showed up..."`
`Just what sort of slip-up had I committed... to cause those fun times to end so suddenly?`
`...Yes, it was the day before Ooishi appeared.`
`Shion, Mion, and Rena had spoken of the curse surrounding Satoshi and his disappearance, and it was so sinister it gave me a bad premonition.`
`...Such a small thing was the slip-up... that invited Oyashiro-sama's servant...?`
`It was absurd.`
`...I kept on groaning to myself... that I would never accept it, ever...`
`I obviously wasn't the only one suppressing my feelings.`
`...Mion and Rena were too.`
` Everyone in the class was doing it.`
`Rika-chan knew something about Satoko's situation.`
` ...But she wouldn't tell us.`
`...Rika-chan still held a calm attitude, like a cat basking in the sun...`
` but she was being unbelievably stubborn about this whole thing.`
`She didn't want to tell us, and that wouldn't change no matter how many times we asked her.`
`...Everyone understood that... so nobody questioned her.`
`"...If Rika-chan won't talk, then we just have to wait.`
` And she might not be talking because it's something not worth saying."`
`There was no persuasive power in reassurance given with an anxious face like that.`
`"....................."`
`Mion was being taciturn... and just looked up at the sky with a somehow annoyed expression.`
`...I couldn't tell if she was unhappy that Rika-chan wouldn't talk about it with her own friends...`
` or if she was concerned over Satoko's well-being.`
`...And what about me?`
`...My anxiety was suffocating me, day after day.`
`If someone else were looking at me... then maybe I'd look annoyed, like Mion did...`
`......Tap tap.`
`...Someone tapped my shoulder.`
` It was Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun.`
`"...Maebara-san.`
` Do you have a minute?"`
`"Did your ball get stuck again?`
` You guys have to get it yourselves this time.`
` Don't rely on the older kids for everything..."`
`I didn't feel like going along with them, so I was a little unsympathetic with my response.`
`"......We heard a little interesting rumor."`
`"...A rumor?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...I just thought... it might have something to do with that..."`
`A rumor...`
`...About Satoko—they hadn't said that, but it didn't seem unrelated.`
`They didn't want to talk in the classroom, so they pulled me behind the school building, lending further credence to that thought...`
`The back of the school was damp and humid like always.`
`...Students didn't really come here because they wanted to.`
`It might, however, have been the ideal location for trading rumors away from prying eyes.`
`"...Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun.`
` ...These rumors—they're about why Satoko is absent, right...?"`
`"We don't know if it has something to do with it though...`
` ...Or maybe......"`
`"...What on earth happened to Satoko?`
` Is she sick?`
` Or could she be... like really sick, or injured or something...?"`
`"No... Actually...`
` it's the opposite...`
`I heard my grandma saying...`
` that she came to buy tofu at our shop yesterday."`
`"Oh—Tomita's family runs a tofu shop," added Okamura-kun.`
`"......She went shopping...`
` to buy some tofu...?"`
`My voice sounds so stupefied even I can tell.`
`...It was understandable.`
`...I was worried about what grave illness or injury she had... when the person herself had been out and about, shopping for tofu.`
`"So... how was she?`
` Did she look okay?`
` Was she wearing a mask, like she was getting better...?`
` Or was she using crutches, or did she have bandages on her...?"`
`"No... There wasn't really... any signs of sickness or injuries on her, but..."`
`I should have felt relieved that it wasn't an illness or an injury.`
`...But my anxiety wasn't going away.`
`...Because Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun's expressions weren't looking any better.`
`"She apparently came to buy one piece of soft tofu... but my grandma said it was strange..."`
`"Strange?`
` Why?`
` What's wrong with buying soft tofu?"`
`Irritated by how roundabout they were being, I had to desperately fight that irritation from creeping into my voice.`
`"Well, Houjou and Furude live by themselves, and they don't have that much money, right?`
` ...So they only ever buy the cheaper, firmer kind of tofu. `
`...They've never bought the soft stuff—it's the most expensive thing there."`
`"...Soft or hard, they're both tofu, right?`
` Maybe she just wanted to eat some great tofu or something."`
`"W-Well... maybe, but......"`
`...I knew how transparent I sounded right then.`
`......This wasn't anything trivial—it was some kind of important clue.`
`Not the cheap firm tofu, but the expensive soft kind...`
`...Shopping not in the evening after school, but in the middle of the day.`
`...I couldn't figure out what those things meant.`
`As I thought hard about it, Okamura-kun took his turn to speak.`
`"...Me next.`
` ......This is just a rumor...`
` but apparently, he's back."`
`"He?`
` Who?`
` Who's back?"`
`".........Houjou's...`
` ...uncle."`
`Satoko's uncle.`
`...Right, I think Coach told me about him.`
`...Their aunt and uncle had taken them in after Satoko and Satoshi lost their parents in the accident...`
`"Houjou's uncle... They say he skipped town last year, scared of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ......He's really scary, and violent, like a gang member..."`
`Everything Coach told me... came back in bits and pieces.`
`...Right.`
`The mean aunt and uncle who had tormented them all the time.`
`...I think he said... that after their aunt was beaten to death by the deviant, he ran away to his lover's house in Okinomiya in fear of the curse.`
`"...Why would she be staying home from school and shopping for soft tofu in the middle of the day just because her uncle came back?"`
`".................."`
`My underclassmen clammed up and looked downwards.`
`...There must have been some big hint buried in there.`
`...Even if I didn't understand, if I told Mion or Rena about it, maybe they'd know something...`
`"Oh... My bad, you two.`
` ...You were nice enough to talk about it, and I started hammering you with questions..."`
`"Oh... No, it's okay...`
`Now we know that she hasn't been in bed this whole time, gravely ill.`
` That's worth something, right?"`
`...That might be true.`
`...But... it still won't...`
`It won't make the clouds over my mind... fade away.`
`"Ah!!`
` M-Maebara-san, over there!!"`
`Okamura-kun cried wildly, pointing over my shoulders behind me.`
`Startled, I turned around... and way on the other side of the schoolyard... near the school gate, I saw a figure trudging forth.`
` ......Ah!!!`
`"It's Houjou...!!"`
`I burst into a run faster than I could speak.`
`...So that, as quickly as possible, I could see with my own eyes that she was okay.`
`"Sa......Satokooooo!!!"`
`Satoko seemed taken aback by me shouting and running over to her.`
`"Oh!`
` My, what is it, Keiichi-san...!`
` You surprised me with all the yelling and running...!"`
`"Stupid, enough about me already!!`
` Three days—what happened, Satoko!?`
` I was so worried...!!!"`
`"Oh-ho-ho-ho...!`
` What a worrywart.`
` It was only three days!`
` You're such a worrywart, Keiichi-san..."`
`From listening to her... she seemed like the normal Satoko, but I could tell she was clearly acting strangely.`
`Her smile was somehow forlorn... and her complexion was bad for some reason.`
`"Houjou...!"`
` "Were you all right?! Were you sick or something...??"`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun both expressed their concerns.`
`"Just... what happened, anyway...!?`
` Three days!`
` Do you know how worried I was...!?"`
`"Oh, I do so apologize.`
` I was just giving the house a good cleaning.`
` We haven't used it for a rather long time, so everything was covered in dust..."`
`"...Huh?`
` ...Satoko, what are you talking about?`
` Why would you have to stay home from school to clean the house?"`
`Satoko didn't answer me—instead she passed by me and headed for the entrance.`
`"Gosh.`
` It is nearly about lunchtime, is it not?`
` I am just starving."`
`...It was certainly lunch break.`
`I couldn't force her to stop after she told me she wanted lunch since she was so hungry.`
`"...Well, whatever!`
` Rika-chan's been bringing your lunch for three days now!`
` You look like you can eat it today.`
` Let's just go to the classroom,`
` and put everyone's minds at ease!"`
`"You're right.`
` ...I suppose I may have caused everyone to worry.`
` ...Oh-ho-ho.`
` It sure is tough being popular!"`
`I put a hand on Satoko's shoulder and we ran to the classroom together.`
`...Up close, I was able to verify that Satoko looked somehow weak.`
`...All this anxiety was supposed to go away when I saw her again...`
`That's what I had thought.`
`..................But now, I actually started to have quite different fears.`
`What... the heck happened, Satoko...?`
`Everyone in the class, of course, reacted in the same exact way I had.`
`"We worried about you!"`
` "I'm glad to see you well!"`
` "What were you doing for three days?"`
`Our classmates showered her in questions.`
`"I truly do apologize for causing a fuss...! Oh-ho-ho-ho!!"`
`As she cackled, she chowed down on the bento Rika-chan had made for her.`
`Those in the teacher's lounge must have been informed of Satoko's arrival, because our teacher sprinted into the classroom, her breathing ragged.`
`"Houjou-san!!"`
`"Oh, Sensei.`
` I'm sorry for worrying you these three days!`
` Oh-ho-ho!`
` As you can see, I am fit as a fiddle."`
`"...My... I was very worried about you!`
` When you are done eating, come right to the teacher's lounge.`
` I have a lot to talk to you about."`
`"I must be in for a good scolding for those three days I cut class, oh-ho-ho...!"`
`Satoko laughed sheepishly while she scratched her head, and the rest of the class burst out into laughter.`
`The teacher was acting angry, but she breathed a sigh of relief at seeing Satoko healthy and smiling as she ate her lunch with the class surrounding her.`
`"......What a relief, right, Rena?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Oh, sorry.`
` Yeah, I'm glad she's okay."`
`...I looked at Rena and knew.`
`...She had a sense that something about Satoko was off too.`
`I looked to see Mion detached from the clamor as well, with a somewhat grim expression.`
`...But Rika-chan, on the other hand, was smiling from ear to ear.`
`She spread out the bento boxes one by one as Satoko finished them...`
`Finally Satoko was satisfied, and after enjoying a thorough conversation with her classmates, remembered that she'd been called to the teacher's lounge.`
`"...It's such a pain, but I think she'll be angrier if I don't go."`
`"...I'll go with you."`
`Satoko rises from her seat, and Rika-chan runs over to her.`
`"I do apologize, Keiichi-san.`
` I'll be right back after getting scolded."`
`"R-Right.`
` ...I mean, I could go with you too.`
` We're all comrades in getting scolded in the teacher's lounge—ever since the curry incident, right?"`
`"...That won't be necessary.`
` ...Keiichi should mind the place while we're away."`
`Rika-chan's words were gentle, but the firm rejection was clear in her eyes.`
`The two of them exited into the hallway, walking shoulder to shoulder...`
`After seeing them off, the class breathed a collective sigh of relief, broke apart, and went back to their usual lunch break banter.`
`We, however, couldn't go back to how we usually were.`
`".................."`
`Not I, not Mion, and of course, not Rena.`
`...They stared at the classroom exit Satoko and Rika-chan had left through, their expressions a little distant and grim.`
`"......We're all friends.`
` ...Isn't that right?"`
`I blurted out something strange, so Mion and Rena turned around with dubious expressions.`
`"I won't keep anything from my friends.`
` So I'll tell you what I just heard a little while ago."`
`I told them the stories I heard from Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun earlier about the tofu shop and how Satoko's uncle had apparently come back.`
` All at once, without letting them speak.`
`"...And that's all I know.`
` So if either of you knows anything, please say so.`
` ...I've said everything I can."`
`I ended my sentence firmly and looked into Mion and Rena's eyes in turn...`
`Rena stared right back at me.`
`...Her eyes didn't falter.`
`Without even opening her mouth, I could tell she wasn't hiding anything.`
`...Then our gazes turned to Mion.`
`"......It's not... like I was trying to keep it a secret or anything."`
`Mion couldn't seem to endure our silent stares... and began to talk timidly, as if she was guilty of something.`
`"......It's just... now that you've said something, Kei-chan... I guess I have to talk about it..."`
`"...Mii-chan... You know something?"`
`"...Well, I mean... I knew from the first day that Satoko's uncle had come home...`
` That he... just randomly showed up in Hinamizawa last Sunday..."`
`"...Why didn't you tell us that?!"`
`"!! ......I-I... I'm sorry..."`
`My angry shout caused Mion to flinch away, look down... and hang her head uncomfortably...`
`"Keiichi-kun, it's nothing to get angry about.`
` You're scaring Mii-chan."`
`"Huh...... oh... sorry I shouted at you..."`
`...I lowered my head in apology.`
`...Mion accepted it, collected herself, and continued.`
`According to her... her uncle's relationship with his lover, whom he had been with in Okinomiya, had collapsed.`
` ...Without anywhere to go, he went back home to Hinamizawa.`
`......And... on that Sunday, the day of the barbecue...`
`Her uncle ran into Satoko......`
` and brought her back to the house.`
`"...Why..`
` did he bring her with him?"`
` ...He can't even cook by himself, much less do any cleaning."`
`"But... But that's... He brought Satoko-chan back to have her cook and clean?!"`
`I remember that she said... she'd been cleaning the house... when I met her back at the school gate.`
`......A moment later... the pieces fell into place... into the jigsaw puzzle of unease.`
`...And as for... what the puzzle depicted, when I saw it from afar...`
`I could see the answer clearly...`
`"...Satoko was locked up at home...`
` and tormented into doing the housework...`
` Those are... the rumors..."`
`If you knew that, why didn't you speak up?!`
`...I nearly yelled that at Mion, but hastily stopped myself...`
`"M-Mii-chan, is...... is that true?!"`
`"I haven't seen it myself... so I don't know if it's true or not..."`
`Mion looked down again... and, staring at the floor, grew quiet.`
`"......Just like last year?`
` Like when they lived with their mean uncle and his wife...?"`
`"........................"`
`"......But this uncle... is completely helpless when it comes to housework, right?`
`"...Keiichi-kun, I don't know what grounds you have for saying that.`
` But you shouldn't be so irresponsible."`
`Rena clearly and directly got mad at me.`
`...You don't know much about this, so don't talk as though you do—yes, that's clearly what she meant...`
`"...Fine... Then do... do you know something, Rena......?"`
`"...I don't know anything either.`
` I didn't know her uncle had taken her to the house until hearing it just now.`
` ...But...`
` The situation is different from a year ago."`
`"...The situation is different... What does that mean?"`
`"Satoshi-kun isn't here."`
`"......Satoshi... really cared about his little sister.`
` ...He always stuck up for her.`
` ...He was her shield... so that she would be affected just a little less by their mean aunt and uncle's fighting."`
`"...The mean uncle and Satoko-chan are the only ones living there now.`
` ...Can't you imagine how stifling that must be, Keiichi-kun?`
` ...Do you think a person who came back for such an unpleasant reason would be able to treat Satoko-chan kindly?"`
`...She was right... It wasn't easy for me to imagine Satoko not being tormented.`
`"............Um...... sorry........."`
`"...Oh...... No, I'm sorry too.`
` ...I sounded like I was interrogating you, didn't I? Hau~!"`
`An awkward atmosphere floated among us.`
`...The three of us remained silent and just stared at the floor...`
`Finally, we heard the principal's bell ringing.`
`The teacher came back with Satoko and Rika-chan at her side.`
`"All right, all right, we're starting afternoon class!`
` Class president, please!"`
`"Everybody stand up!!"`
`"Oh-hohoho... I'm sorry.`
` How rude of me..."`
`I couldn't read anything from Satoko's vaguely sheepish expression.`
`...But given the clouded look Rika-chan was wearing behind her...`
` it was tough to laugh off the disquieting story I'd heard from Mion...`
`"Awright!!`
` First time in a while everyone's been here!!`
` Let's all have a roaring good time with the whole club!!"`
`Yeah, perfect!!`
`Indeed... in times like these, the best thing to do was obviously get rowdy and scheme against one another in a club activity!!`
`"Ehehehehe!`
` Just what I was waiting for~!`
` Hey, Satoko-chan!`
` Let's play!"`
`"There was that game you liked, wasn't there? What was it again...`
` It doesn't matter which!`
` Tell me?`
` Tell me~!!"`
`Mion laughed happily, took a bunch of games out of the club locker, and lined them up on the desks.`
`I think that was the first time Mion's ever let someone else decide on a game for her.`
`...I could tell she was being especially considerate to Satoko.`
`...Thinking that whatever her circumstances, if we could just enjoy our time together as a group... that might be some comfort, some diversion...`
`Satoko seemed to understand her feelings, too... and smiled vaguely, though pleased.`
`...But... her head slowly moved from side to side.`
`"I'm very grateful, but... your feelings are enough.`
` ...There are... many things I need to do, so..."`
`...Even Rika-chan hung her head in remorse.`
`"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Seriously?!`
` All the club members are here for once and we're not playing anything?! `
`Desertion in the face of the enemy—what was the punishment game for it? What part of the club constitution was that in?!"`
`"...Stop it, Mii-chan.`
` ...We can't force her to play with us."`
`"...Hey, this old man isn't trying to force her or anything...!`
` I just thought it would be more fun for sure if we did something exciting...!"`
`"...Really, I'm happy you feel that way.`
` ...Don't worry—next we meet, you'll see! I'll get you all caught in a gigantic trap!`
` ...Ohh-ho-ho-ho!"`
`Satoko, while insulting us, still said she couldn't participate in the club today and apologized...`
` She quickly put her things into her bag, and pattered out into the hallway, disappearing...`
`It all happened in the blink of an eye.`
`".........Satoko..."`
`Rika-chan stared lonesomely as her friend hurried home, unable to be part of club activities...`
`Silence filled the classroom.`
`...Both the cheerful voices of our classmates in the schoolyard and the voices of the cicadas sounded like they were coming from some faraway world.`
`"......Pff.`
` ...This is boring."`
`...The silence was broken by Mion's bitterness, as she began putting the games on the desk back into the locker.`
`...Everyone just stared absently at Satoko's seat, now empty.`
`"...Rika-chan.`
` Maybe you could tell us about it now?"`
`"................"`
`Rena made as gentle a smile as she possibly could and spoke softly to Rika-chan.`
`...Even without hearing it from her, we pretty much knew the situation at this point.`
`Satoko's uncle had broken up with his lover and come back home to Hinamizawa.`
`...And he had taken Satoko back home and forced her to do all the household work...`
`...And that all had to be pretty rough on her.`
`Thinking this was common knowledge to everyone, I skipped to the important part.`
`...Maybe Mion and Rena... wanted to ask the same question.`
`...Nobody spoke—we all just stared, waiting for Rika-chan's reply.`
`"..............."`
`Rika-chan still didn't answer us.`
`......We were hoping for her to say no... but her silence was a bad enough sign.`
`"......Last year, was it?`
` It was like this when both her uncle and his wife were here, right?"`
`"...Yeah.`
` At the time, they were mostly just being caught between their aunt and uncle fighting.`
` ...One of the ways we helped out was with the club, by reducing her time at home as much as we could, but... `
`......He's making her do the chores now... so she can't stay at school either."`
`...Shit...`
`Satoko's not a slave...!`
`Who do you think you are... ignoring your own inability to live properly and basically putting Satoko under house arrest...?!`
`"...When you think about it, isn't this really strange?`
` Can't we notify the police or something?"`
`"...You're right.`
` ...If we had evidence she was being abused, I think we could tell the police.`
`Rena and I kept saying "police, police" as though it were nothing, but Mion's response sounded like she thought we were a little naive.`
`"...It's easy for you to say that.`
` Have you thought about the risks of actually getting proof?"`
`"What do you mean... risks?"`
`"...I think it was two winters ago.`
` ...We reported it.`
` We told them there was abuse happening, and to do something right away."`
`"Huh? You did?`
` ...What happened?"`
`"A person came as soon as we called.`
` ...She interviewed Satoko and Satoshi about what was going on.`
` And then their uncle and his wife, too."`
`"...I can understand asking Satoko and Satoshi... but wouldn't it be not so good to talk to the aunt and uncle...?"`
`"They said they'd base their judgement on what they heard from both sides.`
` Great of them, wasn't it?"`
`"...So... what did they decide to do?"`
`"Wait and see."`
`"...What... What do you mean 'wait and see'?!"`
`"The uncle really studied up on this stuff.`
` By law, you can't call it abuse unless assault or child neglect has been established. `
`...They poked and prodded Satoko and Satoshi a lot, but it never left any real marks on them.`
` They were pretty much eating three meals a day, and had beds. `
`And there weren't any recordings or something like that to prove they'd said or done anything to cause them psychological trauma.`
` ...None of the villagers had ever actually seen them being violent, either. `
`...No matter how mean you are, you wouldn't act so violent in front of other people.`
` Nobody would."`
`"Then... what happened...?"`
`The aunt and uncle knew they were being watched, though, and didn't torment them in any way that would stand out.`
` ...Of course... that wasn't the end of it."`
`"......You mean they... ramped up how malicious they were being...?"`
`Mion sighed and nodded.`
`"...Their aunt was really damn stubborn.`
` ...She's one of the most spiteful people I've ever known. `
`......Apparently she was doing some pretty disgusting things.`
` ......Satoko... was like a doll that did nothing but breathe by the end of it..."`
`...So what?`
` ...From that conclusion... does that mean they never should have contacted child welfare in the first place...?`
`"...Understand?`
` Without proof of abuse so clear anyone could see it, there's nothing we can do.`
` ...In fact, it might even make the situation worse.`
` ......We...`
` messed up pretty bad..."`
`...After hearing that even public organizations, the one thing they thought was dependable, couldn't do anything... everyone hung their heads...`
`"...In other words... until we have clear evidence of abuse, we shouldn't notify anyone?"`
`"...Mm.`
` ...Well, I mean...`
` Basically, yeah."`
`I considered Satoko's current situation.`
`She was brought back to her house.`
`...It was a little... difficult to call that abuse.`
`She was being tormented and forced to do the chores.`
`...How she was being tormented would be the key... but without concrete evidence, it would be difficult to prove.`
`...If she had some kind of external injury, that would work...`
` but as far as we could tell from today, she had nothing like that.`
`And being forced to do the chores—that was a bit weak, too...`
`There had to be better evidence that she was without a doubt being abused.`
`...Ah, I know.`
`...Her uncle had ignored Satoko's existence for a whole year and went to live with his lover in town.`
`...Didn't that fall under one of the definitions of abuse that Mion had mentioned—child neglect?`
`"...Yeah.`
` ...It's the perfect case of child neglect.`
` ...What about that, Mii-chan?!"`
`"Um... hmm...`
` ...If her uncle weren't here now, it could be recognized as child neglect...`
` But he's living with her at the moment, isn't he? `
`They were apart before, but if he said something like... he had a change of heart and decided to live with her... then they might just 'wait and see' again."`
`...Once we reported it, we would need to be absolutely sure they'd interpret it as abuse.`
`...Maybe we needed far more concrete evidence... lest we repeat last year's mistake...`
`"...It's, well... It's sad.`
`"............Mgh..."`
`...The only plan I could think of was, in the end, just watching and waiting.`
`...It left me in shock... when I realized that it would be the same policy as that of the officials who had made the situation worse...`
`As Mion said... reporting it to a public agency would be a gamble.`
`If we're going to pick a fight, it would have to be one we couldn't afford to lose.`
`If we were gambling, without enough money—without enough evidence, our defeat would be assured.`
`...If we took the time to amass enough 'money' that we could be sure of victory...`
` then that would mean pretending we didn't see Satoko's plight for a considerable amount of time...`
`"......Sorry for bringing this up now, but...`
` How is Rika-chan able to live by herself...?"`
`"......"`
`Rika-chan had lost her parents, if I recalled correctly.`
`...From what I'd heard, she had no relatives either.`
`She was forced to live on her own as a result... but her life was unfettered, free of restriction.`
`...If she could somehow grant that freedom to Satoko, too...`
`"...I mean, Rika-chan... you're living without any parents, right?`
`"......Keiichi-kun... That's... cruel..."`
`"...I'm not saying it to be mean.`
` ...I only asked because I thought maybe there would be a hint to saving Satoko.`
` ...Rika-chan, sorry if I offended you."`
`Rika-chan shook her head, not particularly disturbed.`
`"...Well, you see...`
` It's because I'm considered the mayor's daughter."`
`"Let me explain...`
` The mayor, old man Kimiyoshi, is Rika-chan's guardian.`
` He got official permission from the governor of the prefecture."`
`"Huh...`
` So you're adopted?"`
`"No, not adopted.`
` You can be someone's guardian without being in the same family."`
`"...Oh, I get it.`
` ...Rika-chan lives by herself, but by law, she's considered to live with the mayor, right...?"`
`"Yeah, basically.`
` ...However Satoko is actually living there as a freeloader."`
`"...Meep.`
` I don't understand the hard things... but anyway, she's right."`
`"Interesting you should say that, Mion.`
` ...You can be someone's guardian even if they're in another family?`
` ...Then shouldn't we have the mayor or someone else become Satoko's guardian, if only on paper?!"`
`Then... she'd be in the same position as Rika-chan.`
`...And she could go back to her old life...!`
`"Too bad it won't work!`
` ...I mean, her uncle is supposedly her guardian."`
`"...Wait a minute.`
` You lost me there.`
` ...What's a guardian exactly, anyway?"`
`In legal terms, a guardian and a parent weren't necessarily synonyms.`
`So... whoever was actually looking after her at home would be considered her guardian.`
`"...Then her uncle isn't her guardian.`
` He left Satoko by herself for so long!"`
`"But if he insists he's her guardian, then that's it!`
` It's been a few days since Satoko was taken back to her house.`
` Her uncle's been paying for her meals, since then, right?`
`He is sort of looking after her, so he'd probably insist.`
` And even though he abandoned her for a year, he'd already looked after her for the whole year before that,`
` but the mayor doesn't have that kind of history."`
`"...So then if both the mean uncle and the mayor requested guardianship at the same time... the uncle would make more sense?"`
`"No, but he'd have a better chance!`
` ...The term 'guardian' refers to the person actually caring for her, right? `
`The uncle actually has a bed and food for her, but the mayor would just have his name—it wouldn't even be a contest."`
`"Then... shouldn't the mayor just start caring for her for real?!`
` He'd be her guardian in name and reality if he did!"`
`We just need to shelter Satoko!`
`That might lead to her uncle being desperate to take her back, but we'll stubbornly refuse him!!`
`"It won't be that easy!!`
` Satoko is a growing girl, you know?`
` It's not like giving someone a cat—you're asking him to care for a real person!!"`
`"Then Coach!!`
` What about Coach?!`
` Coach, he's... I don't know, he's got a lot of money, right?`
` He even said it himself! `
`Even if he's not her real father... Coach could become her guardian!!`
` Coach would... he would be great at taking care of her!"`
`"Stop that!!`
` Stop thinking of Satoko like a pet!!`
` All you're doing is talking about pushing her onto someone else! `
`You need to think more seriously about how much responsibility it is to care for another human being!!`
` Did you ask him?!`
` Did you get an actual promise from him that he'd take Satoko under his care?!"`
`"...N-No, I didn't.`
` ...But Coach would definitely say yes...!"`
`"Hah! Well, fine.`
` Even considering the 0% probability of Coach saying it was okay, then what?`
` It still wouldn't work!!`
` He couldn't become a guardian all by himself!!"`
`......Agh......!`
`That's right...`
`Coach... Didn't he say it himself?`
`...He was alone... so he couldn't do it...!!`
`Sh-Shit!! What the hell?!`
`Why is being single such a disadvantage in this society?!`
`...Then, then... all you could do is marry into a wealthy family, couldn't you?!`
`"...Is there anyone that wealthy in Hinamizawa...?`
` ...I'm not sure..."`
`"See?`
` It's not simple!!`
` It's hard to adopt someone!!`
` And you can't go into it thinking you'll push Satoko onto someone else just for a little while!!`
` You're being naive, Kei-chan!!"`
`"Shit, damn it, what the hell?!`
` I'm desperately thinking of how to save Satoko, and all you're saying is no, no!! `
`Don't you care about Satoko at all?!`
` Are you even worried about our friend one bit?!`
` What do you have to say for yourself?!"`
`"That's...!`
` ...I didn't... mean that!!`
` But... it just won't be that easy, and...!!"`
`"It's not that difficult a problem!`
` We just need to have some rich people look after Satoko for a while, that's all!!`
`Right... What about your family, Mion?!`
` You always brag about how great it is being one of the Three Families or whatever, don't you?!`
` From what you've said, you must live in a gigantic house!!"`
`"M-My house...?!`
` No, that won't happen!! ...My... my grandma would never allow it...!"`
`"Then what about your relatives in Okinomiya?!`
` From what I heard, they're living in luxury themselves!! `
`There's plenty of shops your relatives manage in town too!!`
` Your family are basically millionaires, aren't they?!"`
`"No... no, that won't work!!`
` Going to Okinomiya is even more out of the question!!`
` My father... He'd never let it happen, ever!!!"`
`"Hey, hey, hey, hey!!`
` Normally you act like some high and mighty bigwig, and now you're being all spineless?`
` What the hell?!`
` Are you just going to sit by and watch Satoko suffer?!?!"`
`"T-That's... no, I don't, but...!!`
` I mean... I want to help her as much as you!`
` But... That's a different... a different story..."`
`"How is it a different story?!`
` How can you be so cold-hearted!!`
` Your friend is in trouble!!`
` What are you if you don't rescue her?!`
` You're our president!!`
` Our club president!!`
` Save her!!`
` Save her from this crisis!! `
`If you don't save her right now, you're not her friend—you're not even human!!`
` I don't know if you have any humanity left in you!!`
` Are you listening to me, Mion?!?"`
`My emotions all exploded out of me... and I didn't even give her a chance to say anything in response.`
`...I just wanted to make Mion agree with me, even if I had to force her.`
` ...If she did, Satoko's problems would be solved.`
`If pushing her would solve the issue... then I'd push her as much as I needed to!!`
`"Why aren't you saying anything anymore?!`
` I'm asking you, asshole!`
` Well? Say something, Mion Sonozakiiiii!!!"`
`"...............Mii...?"`
`"......mgh......... kh............`
` ...hic...!"`
`...Mion, looking down with a grim face, began sobbing...`
`...Her hands were clenched into trembling fists... and she rubbed her eyes to wipe away... the tears...`
`...Was... what I said actually that mean...?`
`This isn't the time to cry—we're in the gambling room now, and we have to do something to save Satoko!`
`...And as I thought that, Rena spoke, her voice cold and incredibly calm.`
`".........Keiichi-kun.`
` If Mii-chan's family won't work, then what if we look for another wealthy family?`
` I know someone in Hinamizawa who lives in a nice, big house."`
`"...W-Who's that?"`
`"Oh, come on.`
` You've got a splendid family, and you're leaving it out of things?"`
`"...My... my family...?`
` My family is..."`
`"You're friends, right? Save her, Keiichi-kun.`
` Mii-chan is cold-hearted, after all.`
` Since you are so considerate towards friends, you should lead by example. `
`Just the three of you are living in that huge house, right?`
` Then you've probably got plenty of spare rooms.`
` You should just give a few of the empty ones to Satoko-chan.`
` And then her worries would all be over!`
` What's this?`
`We're done already?`
` That was pretty quick!`
` Okay, great, congratulations on solving the problem!!`
` Then are we done for today?!`
` I'm going home, hooray, hooray!! `
`Maybe I'll go treasure hunting—I haven't done that in a while!!`
` I was so worried about Satoko-chan until now that I didn't feel like going to play at all!!`
` I wonder what I'll find today, hauu... `
`............Say something, will you?!`
` Why am I the only one talking?!`
` Say something, you bastard—are you listening, Keiichi Maebara?!?!"`
`............Even the cicadas... seemed to cower in fear.`
`Rena, her shoulders bobbing up and down—and me, who had forgotten to breathe.`
`...Mion, whose face had gone completely pale, and Rika-chan, who was keeping silent as if nothing had happened.`
`...The atmosphere in the classroom grew tight and stiff... and it petrified us where we stood.`
`Rattle.`
`The sound of the chair as Rena sat back down after having stood up... finally allowed everyone present to take a breath.`
`"..............."`
`...Rena......... had shown me just how much... I'd hurt Mion.`
`".........Rena's scary."`
`After a few moments...`
` Rika-chan cut into the frozen air.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I'm sorry, Rika-chan.`
` Mii-chan, I'm sorry to you too.`
` ...I don't have to apologize to you, do I, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ...I'm sorry.`
` ...I'm sorry for being so unreasonable."`
`"Were you saying all that to me before?`
` You said it while glaring at Mii-chan, so I totally thought you were talking to her."`
`......Rena had such strength... that you wouldn't have imagined it normally.`
`...All I did was spout terrible things as a wave of violent fury passed over me—I couldn't contend with her.`
`"......Mion... I'm sorry.`
` .........I lost my cool."`
`Come to think of it, I didn't understand what had gotten me that riled up...`
`...I thought of myself as Satoko's Nii-nii...`
` so I only had good intentions... that I'd think about it a little harder than everyone else, and yet...`
`"Um...... mm.`
` ...It's okay.`
` ...You were worrying with everything you had, but all I was saying was that nothing would work...`
` so I'm sorry.`
` I... did something wrong too."`
`Mion rubbed away the tears at the corners of her eyes with her fists and apologized as well...`
`We bowed our heads to each other... and looked down, without glancing at the other.`
`"..............."`
`Someone, I don't know who... heaved a sigh.`
`...Satoko being tormented... had been known about since last year.`
`How had... the tragedy back then saved Satoko?`
`How had they brought it to an end...?`
`...Right.`
`...In the end... nobody could do anything.`
`...All they could do was bear it patiently... and wait for those agonizing days to end.`
`...That's right.`
`On the night of Watanagashi last year... their mean aunt had been beaten to death.`
`...But it hadn't been done to save Satoko or Satoshi.`
`...Right.`
` ...It really was... just a coincidence.`
`Satoko's friends, who needed to do something for her most of all, could do nothing.`
`...The incident may have been a tragic one...`
` but from Satoko's viewpoint...`
` it was nothing less than a miracle.`
`Yes, a miracle.`
`...A miracle one could only wait for.`
`"...Is waiting all...`
` all we can do?"`
`Not for evidence of abuse—not for something that minor.`
`"...Huh?`
` .........Wait...`
` for what...?"`
`"......A miracle."`
`...No one made fun of me for using such a crazy word.`
`......We couldn't come up with any solutions, so it was the only thing we could do...`
`"............We're...`
` powerless."`
`That one word Mion dropped...`
` was the finishing blow.`
`...It was hot.`
`...My body was sticky with sweat.`
`...The worst month...`
` June.`
`I walked forward quite a ways... then turned right where the rice fields ended.`
`...I'd never come here before, so I had no idea where to go.`
`I got lost several times, so I may have taken quite a long way around.`
`...Maybe I should have gone back home and gotten my bike first...`
`...It would have... made everyone else worry if I'd asked them... so I asked one of our other classmates where Satoko's actual house was.`
`That house was originally her family's, apparently—not their uncle and his wife's.`
`...Their house had been bigger... so they had taken it for themselves.`
`Right here.`
`...Several houses all in a line.`
` .........Over there...?`
`...I was visiting Satoko's house... but didn't particularly intend to meet her there.`
`...I didn't mean to spy on the enemy, her mean uncle, either.`
`......Maybe I just... wanted to be a little closer to her... as her Nii-nii.`
` ......Pretty words—but I didn't know if they were true.`
`......If what Tomita-kun and the others told me was right...`
` ...it'd be this house...?`
`When I recognized it... my feet grew heavy.`
`...What did... I come here for?`
`My motive for coming here... was absurd.`
`...When Mion had said at the end that we were powerless... it made me sort of frustrated.`
`I just wanted to do something, anything other than waste the days away praying for a miracle.`
` ...That's what made me come here.`
`...But... that was all.`
`Even if I... I were to witness her uncle actually tormenting Satoko... what could I do?`
`...Would I act like a comic book hero, punch the guy in the face, and take Satoko away with me?`
`And then live together somewhere far away?`
`...That was ridiculous.`
`"...I'm.........`
` powerless........."`
`......The cicadas' voices, raised in chorus, sounded like they were scoffing at me.`
`...As though they were saying... that if I couldn't do anything and wouldn't do anything, then I should go back home.`
`I heard a car approaching so I got out of its way.`
`...But the car stopped right behind me, its horn honking shortly once.`
`Annoyed—hadn't I gotten out of their way?—I looked behind me... and a familiar face was looking at me out of the driver's seat window.`
`"...Coach..."`
`"Hello, Maebara-san.`
` How unexpected to meet you all the way out here.`
` Do you live nearby?"`
`...Me being here wasn't normal.`
`...Just as I considered somehow giving him the slip, I noticed Satoko sitting in the passenger's seat.`
`"...S-Satoko...?"`
`Satoko got out of the car and began unloading a lot of groceries from the trunk.`
`"...I happened to run into Coach on my way back from shopping.`
` ...He said he'd bring me home, so I accepted his offer."`
`"...She wouldn't have been able to carry all those groceries on her bike."`
`As Coach spoke, he pulled Satoko's bike from out of the back seat where they'd put it.`
`The grocery bags were big... and there were four of them.`
`...They all seemed to be packed full and very heavy.`
`"...Those bags... Sevens Mart...?!`
` Hey... isn't that a little far to go by bicycle?!"`
`I looked at the bags... and saw that they were filled to the brim with sake bottles, snacks that you'd eat with sake, and boxes of cigarettes.`
`...Their weight was one thing... but their contents were nothing less than luxury items...`
`"......I made it thanks to Coach...`
` He helped me out.`
` ...It was a little... difficult going up those hills."`
`Satoko gave Coach a smile filled with gratitude...`
` but it was incredibly awkward and even heartrending...`
`"Satoko......`
` These groceries... aren't for dinner tonight, are they...?"`
`"...Of course not.`
` ...I do not drink sake, and I hate snacks.`
` ...Of course I don't smoke, either..."`
`...He... he made Satoko go to a distant store by herself on her bike...`
`So she could buy dumb shit like this...?`
`And what was the uncle doing right now, anyway?`
`He must have been working up a good sweat at this very moment if he needed to send Satoko out by herself, right...?!`
`If not... then how much... how much had Satoko suffered for no reason...?!`
`...I hadn't intended to voice my feelings.`
`...But... they may have made it into my face.`
`Coach might have noticed, because he clapped me on the shoulder...`
`Just then, one of the house windows clattered open... and the face of a vulgar man, the very sight of which made me immediately avert my eyes, emerged from within it...`
`...There were no self-introductions necessary.`
`...My gut told me... that this was the uncle in question.`
`The first thing out of his mouth <i>should</i> have been words of gratitude for Satoko...`
`"Satokoo!!`
` You left the heat for the sake on when you left, you halfwit!!"`
`"...I-I'm sorry...`
` But you... told me to go right away..."`
`"Shut up!!`
` You've gone and ruined it! And it was the good stuff, too!`
` What'll you do about it!?"`
`"...I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...!"`
`Satoko miserably... apologized over and over, bowing again and again...`
` ...She could be perfectly described... as a small animal.`
`...I had no idea... what was happening.`
`...Satoko finished shopping... for all this heavy stuff that wasn't even for dinner!`
`...She only managed to come back because she ran into Coach and he drove her home...`
`If she hadn't been found by him...`
` She'd surely... still be by herself...`
` panting and moaning, pedaling her bicycle...`
` up that steep hill.`
`What was with those words... those horrible, sleazy words... that he said to Satoko?!`
`...In what country's dictionary...`
` did it tell him to say such things...`
` to a young girl who'd just finished shopping?!`
`...My anger, of course, wouldn't reach him.`
`...The uncle displayed no interest in me, instead shouting at Coach.`
`"......Oh.`
` If it isn't Doctor Irie!`
` Hallo, hallo!`
` Why don't you come on inside too?`
` We're in the last round, so you can get in right away.`
` A hundred yen per thousand points, and anything goes."`
`"...No...`
` I'll pass, thank you.`
` I just ran into Satoko-chan and gave her a lift is, all.`
` I'll be leaving now."`
`"Aww, nah~ Come play a round!`
` You've got a lot of money, yeah?`
` Dah-ha-ha-ha-ha!"`
`...I didn't even understand what her uncle and Coach were talking about.`
`But I knew one thing for sure... none of what he'd just said had been to thank Satoko in any way.`
`"Satoko, could you bring us the damn snacks?!`
` And start gettin' those beers chilled too.`
` Go get us some cold ones from the fridge!!"`
`"Tecchan, you're so harsh on her.`
` She looks so sad, you should take better care of her!"`
`"This is how I gotta treat her.`
` ...She's been like this since she was with my bro.`
` Spoil her and she ain't gonna listen to a damn thing you say...`
` Shit."`
`"Whatever, it's your draw, Tecchan!"`
`"Tsubaki-san declared riichi too."`
`"...Sorry, sorry.`
` ...What? You in riichi again, Tsubaki..."`
`It looked like it wasn't just her uncle—some of his friends were over.`
`...Hey, wait...`
` What was he—`
` no, what were they doing...?`
`Flinging rude words left and right... making Satoko go shopping for your beer... What were they doing?!`
`"My uncle's friends came from town... and they're playing mahjong.`
` ...He told me to prepare dinner for them as well."`
`"Wha...... what... the hell...?"`
`Mahjong?!`
`He called his friends over... for mahjong?!`
`...They were too busy playing... so they sent Satoko... to buy them a crapload of booze from a faraway store...`
` And the first thing he said to her... was how she left the gas on?! `
`What the hell, what the hell—what the hell?!`
`"What... does that guy... think he's doing?!`
` Who could get lost in some dumb game of... mahjong... and send Satoko to buy all this stuff?!"`
`...Even though Coach was listening... he pretended he wasn't.`
`There was a line of heavy-looking shopping bags lined up on the ground next to the trunk.`
`"...Maebara-san, you help too, please.`
` You're a boy—you get to carry this heavy one."`
`"Coach!!`
` You're gonna let this slide?!`
` This is completely...!!"`
`...Coach pretended he hadn't heard that violent outburst, either.`
`...When I thought about it later, his reaction might have been the best thing he could do in that situation...`
`"...I'll carry two of them myself.`
` ...Come on.`
` ...Help us carry them, please."`
`The bags were packed to the brim with bottles of sake and bar snacks.`
`...They were so heavy.`
`...And... so filthy, so unfair.`
`...They weren't just heavy in terms of weight...`
` they made me feel mortified...`
` Nothing could have been heavier than that...`
`"...Keiichi-san, there's no need to push yourself.`
` I'll carry it..."`
`Satoko mistook my biting back the humiliation as grimacing under the weight... and offered to help.`
`"......Stupid...`
` Don't... underestimate me..."`
`...Satoko had never looked down on my physical strength in the slightest.`
` ...Guh...... grah......`
`"...Coach... I'm sorry for you too.`
` ...It must be heavy..."`
`No, not at all...`
` answered Coach, smiling vaguely.`
`...Coolly.`
`...But I, and I alone, knew.`
`...Coach was an adult, so he just knew how to keep his feelings from showing.`
` ...There was even more anger than I was feeling... burning deep in his eyes.`
`"...Well... Haha.`
` ...It is heavy."`
`............Guh.........`
` shit......`
` shit...!`
`It wasn't very far to the doorstep of Satoko's house... but the bags squeezed my palms... and started leaving red marks.`
`"............Guh..."`
`Fury welled up in me, and the back of my throat stung.`
`...But... even if it all came gushing out... it wouldn't solve anything.`
`......So...`
`Just tightly gritting my teeth... was as much as I could do...`
`"...Really, thank you so much.`
` ...Both of you.`
` You really helped me here."`
`After we carried them to the back door, Satoko said that was enough.`
`...Occasionally we'd hear the repulsive laughing of her uncle and his friends from within... and my insides would seethe.`
`...I knew they weren't ridiculing us.`
`And... that was why it made me so mad.`
`...They'd made Satoko shop for all this heavy, selfish stuff, then ignored her and laughed amongst themselves as they pleased... It was deeply aggravating.`
`...Of course, Coach had to have felt the same way.`
`But... if he accidentally let his feelings slip onto his face... he'd only cause Satoko more worry.`
`...He knew all that... and spoke coolly... as if to say he didn't care.`
`"......Not at all.`
` I'm happy I could be a bit of help for you.`
` ...If there's anything else I can help with, please, tell me."`
`"Yes.`
` ......I really am happy you feel that way."`
`...That he feels that way.`
`...Those words... were sad.`
`...Satoko herself... was sad... and resigned... that we could only help her so much.`
`...But she was right.`
`...No matter how much Coach or I want to help Satoko...`
` this was as much as we could do.`
` ......I felt absolutely... ashamed... at not having the power to help her any more than this...`
`Burning, boiling emotions were bubbling up within me... and rising into my throat...`
`Trembling all over... I almost started to cry from my fury...`
`"......Me too... If there's anything I can do... I'll help you whenever you need.`
` ...So, umm... hang in there..."`
`I wanted to at least...`
` give her those trite words, saying that I'd help her whenever she wanted.`
`"...Yes.`
` Thank you very much.`
` ...I'm happy just that... you came all the way here when you didn't need to."`
`...Satoko seemed to have guessed...`
`What I was doing in a place like this...`
` when my house was in the opposite direction from school.`
`"...All right.`
` You should get going.`
` ...They're drunk right now, so there's no telling what they'll get mad at you for."`
`She felt guilty getting us involved... after we'd helped her.`
` ...Because she wanted to be the only one to suffer this misfortune.`
`...That's how it looked... and it hurt.`
`"......Y-You're lying...!!"`
`Coach nudged me in the back.`
`And then he put his index finger to his mouth... to chide me for being so loud.`
`"Really, thank you so much.`
` ...Until tomorrow.`
` ...I hope we can see each other at school."`
`"T-That's not... what I'm talking about!!`
` I asked you how you got that bruise on your hand!!`
` ......Ahh... ah...!!"`
`...The evening glow finally got to a point... where I could see... the other concealed, oval-shaped bruises and traces of swelling.`
`...On her neck...`
` and her legs......`
` and other places too...!`
`"...I fell down the stairs!`
` ...Hohohoho."`
`The very moment... my violent, rampaging emotions were about to burst their way out of my throat... I found my mouth being tightly clamped down on...`
`"Mmnnmff!! Nfmfmfmmmmnfff!!!"`
`Coach was... pressing down on my mouth from behind... wrapping around me tightly with his hands.`
`Because of that, I couldn't say anything.`
`...I could only groan.`
` ...Which I did.`
` That was all I could do.`
`I needed to expel all the magma sitting deep within me.`
` ...Because otherwise I'd surely explode into a million pieces that very moment...`
`So I groaned.`
` I groaned.`
`From my mouth.`
`From my whole body.`
`While heat fell in drops from my eyes.`
`I groaned and groaned... I groaned to the point of exhaustion.`
`"Mggggghhhhh!!`
` Gmhmhmhhmmmmmnnn...!!`
` Gghghhhohoooohhoooohhhhhh!!! ...!!!"`
`...I wrung absolutely everything out of myself.`
`...Even having lost my voice... I was still... wringing it all out......`
`"......I understand how you feel...!!`
` I really do, Maebara-san!!`
` ...Please... please just endure it for now...!`
` Please, I'm asking you... Maebara-san...!!"`
`Endure it for now?!`
` And then what, huh?!`
` What would happen to her... to Satoko?!`
` Her body and mind were wounded... and she was being made to suffer like this... `
`...Can you not even... even let me howl in vain at it?!`
` Is that it, Coach?!`
` Are we this powerless?! So powerless... that we can't even fucking scream from the bottom of our hearts...?!`
`......The voices of the higurashi... made me calm down.`
`I didn't know... how long it had been.`
`Satoko... abruptly... gave a slight bow.`
`"...Thank you very much, Keiichi-san."`
`"............Satoko..."`
`"...You... looked a lot like my real Nii-nii just now.`
` ...My real Nii-nii... may not be here anymore......`
` but I have another Nii-nii named Keiichi-san."`
`"......Yeah, you got it...`
` ...I'm... your Nii-nii.`
` ...And when you're... in pain... I'll help you no matter what...`
` Your Nii-nii... will rescue you for sure..."`
`...Satoshi Houjou... you fucking idiot!!`
`If not now, then when?!`
` Satoko... she's never been in more pain in her life!!`
`If her Nii-nii... doesn't save her now... then when will he?!`
` Why did you run away?!`
` Why did you abandon her?!?`
` Why did you leave Satoko behind?!?`
` You don't... have any right... to call yourself Satoko's Nii-nii!!!`
`"......I... I won't run away..."`
`"...Huh...?"`
`"...I definitely won't...... run away.`
` ...I won't run away and abandon you... like Satoshi did!`
` No way...!!`
` I will not... abandon you!!!"`
`Slip.`
`......Tears... trickled down from Satoko's eyes.`
`And then... she narrowed her eyes... into a smile.`
`"Good-bye...`
` Nii-nii."`
`Satoko took her right hand... and awkwardly waved to me.`
`"...I'll be all right.`
` ...My... my Nii-nii now... helped me... helped me so much...`
` So I'll be okay...`
` I'll do my best... until tomorrow...`
` I'll be okay...`
` ......So...`
` for today... this is... good-bye."`
`There was no way... that I could say "bye, see you tomorrow."`
`And then... from inside the house... came a throaty... disgusting voice.`
`"Satokooooo!!`
` Could you bring us the snacks already?!?!"`
`"...Okay, Nii-nii.`
` ...Get going already.`
` ...I'll... be fine now.`
` ...Hurry."`
`"......Let's go, Maebara-san.`
` ...Staying any longer than this... would be a bother to Satoko-chan."`
`"...Coach.`
` ...Nii-nii's house... is a little far away.`
` ...I'm sorry to ask you this... but could you take him home...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I'll do that."`
`...Coach grabbed me by my collar... and with strength I couldn't have imagined him having... started dragging me away.`
`...And I... unable to oppose him... started getting farther away from Satoko.`
`She waved her hand to us, expression still dark...`
` and disappeared...`
` through the back door.`
`Coach got into the car first, then turned around on the narrow path and brought the passenger side door around for me.`
`"......I know how you feel so well it hurts.`
` ...No... I think I understand it even more than you..."`
`"..............."`
`"......But right now, just for now, please endure it.`
` ...She understood exactly how you feel.`
` ...So... please endure it.`
` If you don't..."`
`"...I... I know already.`
` .........I'm sorry. Thank you for before."`
`.........I meekly got into the passenger's seat.`
`...The car accelerated quietly... and Satoko's house grew farther and farther away in the rear view mirror.`
`...We made a wide turn... and then I couldn't see her house anymore...`
`".........Hm?`
` Is your house that far away?`
` It's in the other direction from the school, isn't it?"`
`...I didn't bother to reply.`
`...I would have been hard-pressed to give him an answer as to why I was at Satoko's house.`
`Coach didn't say anything more either.`
`For a while... the two of us were silent, the only sounds from the gravel spraying over the road as we drove.`
`......I remembered how Rena said things were different than last year.`
`At the time, she had Satoshi with her.`
`...Satoshi protected Satoko.`
`...So that less of the sparks fell onto her.`
`"............But now... Satoshi isn't here."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......That's... the unfortunate truth."`
`...Coach seemed to understand what I really meant when I said that.`
`"...It's a terribly sad... cruel story...`
` but there's a limit... to our resolve, our efforts, and our assistance."`
`...It sounded like an excuse... but he was right.`
`...Even if Coach and I wanted to be people Satoko could depend on...`
` That was all.`
` It ended at the front door.`
`No matter how much I shouted... that I would be her Nii-nii.`
`...No matter how much I shouted that I wouldn't abandon her, and no matter how much Satoko called me Nii-nii.`
` ......I couldn't do... any more than that.`
`"...Where on earth...... could Satoshi have gone?"`
`...Right—Satoshi was another story.`
`...Her actual brother, Satoshi... He was in a position to protect her far, far better than we ever could.`
`...That was the cold, sad truth... of the massive gulf... between Satoshi and us.`
`"............I wonder...`
` what he's been doing lately?"`
`Satoshi left home.`
`...I didn't know why—maybe it was because of Oyashiro-sama's curse, or he disappeared, or something.`
`...In any case, he wasn't beside Satoko now.`
`...At the time Satoko needed him to protect her most, he wasn't here.`
`"......Why isn't he here?!`
` Satoko needs him now more than ever!"`
`"......A lot of people talk about Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` but the only thing I can say...`
` is that he ran away."`
`"One of my friends said that one day he just never came back.`
` ...He ran away without even leaving so much as a note for his sister...?!"`
`"...Satoshi-kun had been doing part-time jobs a lot.`
` ...At the time, Satoko-chan really wanted this huge stuffed animal. `
`...It ended up costing a lot, so he was doing all sorts of part-time jobs in order to afford it.`
` ...He felt so strongly about it. `
`Everyone was whispering about how he at least wanted to get his sister a nice birthday present, since she was being made to live such a pitiful life with her uncle and his wife."`
`...In the end...`
` he didn't use his savings for a birthday present for Satoko.`
`"...Satoshi-kun disappeared, and the police looked long and hard.`
` They found out that Satoshi-kun had withdrawn all his savings himself on the day he left. `
`...After checking all over... they began to think that maybe he'd used his savings to go to Tokyo."`
`"...Tokyo?!`
` For what?!"`
`"......Again...`
` All I can say was that he ran away..."`
`"He saved up all that money so he could run away?`
` ...He was that selfish?!`
` But... how could he just leave Satoko behind?!`
` If he was going to run away anyway... he should have brought Satoko with him!!"`
`...Even now... Coach was still calm.`
`...He wasn't trying to pour any oil on the fire of my anger at all.`
`...He just waited... until my anger naturally subsided.`
`After listening to gravel being crushed under the wheels for a little while... Coach spoke abruptly.`
`"......Please understand.`
` ...Satoko-chan, left behind, arrived at the same conclusion..."`
`'I'm a burden on my brother...`
` and that's why he abandoned me.'`
`...He didn't take her with him when he left.`
`...How terrible... must Satoko have felt... being betrayed by the brother she loved so much...`
`"But... Satoko-chan was a very strong person.`
` ...Of course, she had the support of close friends too... but that was how she regained her smile."`
`I recalled how Satoko had spoken of Satoshi so brightly... when I was eating dinner with her and Rika-chan a few days ago...`
`At the time... I didn't think any more of it than how pleasant their sibling love had been.`
`...But now that I did think about it...`
` I realized...`
` it was like she was peering into the distance... from atop a pile of tragic perseverance.`
`"...She said Satoshi-kun will come back for sure.`
` ...And that when he did, she wanted him to see how she was no longer a burden."`
`"Satoko isn't a burden!!`
` She's... she's way better at day-to-day living than me... and she can do pretty much anything! `
`I mean... she might fall behind Rena or Rika-chan in certain aspects... but she's way more of an adult than most people!"`
`"...That's the result of her having worked so hard, since she didn't know when Satoshi would come home.`
` ...Her efforts are so painful."`
`While she lived with Rika-chan...`
`While Rika-chan taught her how to handle everything flawlessly...`
`All so that she could welcome back Satoshi at any time.`
`...So that she could show him she wasn't ashamed.`
`"......So... when is Satoshi going to come back?"`
`".................."`
`I asked Coach, but knew he wouldn't be able to answer.`
`...In any case, Satoshi ran away.`
`...He left Satoko and ran away from Hinamizawa.`
`......Someone said that when you leave Hinamizawa and run away, Oyashiro-sama's curse gets you, right?`
`...Then... that made sense.`
`...Satoshi running away, and his disappearance... that would obviously mean people thought it was the curse, right...?`
`...And they could smile...`
` as though it were his own fault... as though he got what he deserved.`
`...Hey, Oyashiro-sama, whoever you are.`
`...Satoshi didn't vanish because he ran away... you demoned him away with your curse, didn't you?`
`If that's not what happened... then I won't forgive you.`
`"......When did Satoshi run away?"`
`"...The night of the Watanagashi Festival last year,`
` when their aunt was killed by that deviant...`
` it was a few days after that.`
` ......On Satoko-chan's birthday."`
`"...On Satoko's... birthday...?!"`
`Bang!!`
`I slammed my hands on the dashboard in front of me with all my might.`
`...Satoshi...`
` Of all the days...`
` he could have chosen to run away...!!`
`Their aunt just died a few days before, didn't she?`
`All your days of suffering were about to end, weren't they?`
`...You were just about to start thinking about a new life, weren't you?`
`It's wrong to be happy about someone dying... but for Satoko and her brother... her birthday had come at a critical turning point.`
`Their mean uncle had fled town, and the siblings would be left alone.`
`...They should have been able to be happy about that...`
` on Satoko's birthday.`
`...Satoko was probably... waiting for her brother to return the whole time.`
`...Waiting for her brother to return, when he never did.`
`...Waiting with bated breath for her brother to return... her hopes and dreams of a new life to come growing ever larger.`
`......But no matter how long she waited, he didn't come back.`
` He didn't even contact her.`
`Satoko, trembling in anticipation of a great present... Just when... when would she have to face the cold, terrible truth?`
`......Satoshi... you fucking idiot...`
`I could feel my blood rising to my head... in my anger at Satoshi...`
`I was frustrated.`
`I was aggravated.`
`...I couldn't forgive him...`
` ...Satoko still respected and adored her brother...`
` and yet he so heartlessly betrayed her.`
`...Such a person...`
` wouldn't just come back...`
` now, when he was most needed.`
`...Yes—no one would protect her.`
`...Not even her real brother Satoshi.`
`"......So when... she started to see you as her Nii-nii... I was happy."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"...I pray for Satoko-chan's happiness as well... but I have a position in society and a job to do every day.`
` ...I have little time that I can devote to Satoko-chan. `
`...But you're different.`
` ...You go to school with her, and you're closer to her and Satoshi-kun in age."`
`"............"`
`"...I know you think you can only do so much...`
` but you're in a position where you can give Satoko-chan a hand much better than I can. `
`...So... I want you to help her enough for the both of us.`
` That's what I wish for."`
`"...But that's...`
` Coach, you could..."`
`"Of course, with my job skills, there are plenty of things only I can help her with.`
` But in the same way, there are things only you can do for her. `
`...What I want to say is... we should both perform in every way we can."`
`...Was that a little too complicated...?`
`Coach added that... but I shook my head in response.`
`When I heard him say he had job skills, it reminded me that he was an adult, in a different position from all of us.`
`...Maybe I should ask him about it.`
`"...Oh... Coach... Do you know a lot about laws?"`
`"No, I know even less than the average person, why?"`
`...I thought back to when I argued with Mion and the others about Satoko.`
`Our children's argument had only left us with the conclusion that we had to wait and see, but what would an adult think...?`
`"Hmm, what was it... the Child Welfare Law?`
` As an emergency measure to secure the safety of a juvenile, they can force him or her to separate from the parents."`
`"They can do that...?!`
` So then... we could rescue Satoko from her uncle right away!"`
`".........Satoko-chan...`
` might not want that."`
`"Satoko... doesn't want it?!`
` Why..."`
`"............"`
`Coach didn't answer me.`
`...I didn't know why he didn't.`
`It was clear as day that Satoko's uncle was being violent and treating her like a slave!`
` ...So then why...`
`I clamped down on my frenzied emotions... and waited intently for Coach to answer.`
`But he never did.`
`It wasn't like he was pretending he hadn't heard me.`
`...If I had to say... it was more like he wanted to explain, but couldn't put it into the right words.`
`"A trial?`
` ...This isn't some weird religion we're talking about...!!"`
`"...You might know this, but Satoshi-kun always looked out for Satoko-chan.`
` ...She always relied on him.`
` ...Almost as though she was utterly dependent on him."`
`I'd known for a while that Satoshi had always protected Satoko from their aunt and uncle.`
`But that was his duty as an older brother, not something to worry about...`
`"...I think that may have traumatized her.`
` ...Maybe she figured that depending so heavily on her brother had made him hate her."`
`And for Satoko, the current situation was a retelling of the story of a little over a year ago.`
`...But this time, Satoshi wasn't here...`
`"She wants to overcome this trial by herself, without relying on anyone else.`
` And that if she doesn't grow strong, then Satoshi-kun will never return.`
` ...She thinks something like that now.`
` ...or so I believe."`
`......Now that he mentioned it...`
`...Satoko had never said a word about how hard it had been before.`
`...I figured she was being threatened not to talk about it, but...`
`"...I talked with everyone and we were wondering... if we should report it to the child consultation center."`
`"I have heard...`
` that a social worker was visiting Satoko-chan last year."`
`"...Yes...`
` In the end they decided to wait and see... and we thought maybe that made her get tormented even more."`
`"That was......... Apparently Satoko-chan reported it herself.`
` ...And as a result the abuse worsened, but was kept just out of sight. `
`...She was under even more torment, and the burden on Satoshi-kun for protecting her rose considerably..."`
`"...Huh... Could Satoko...`
` She wouldn't be thinking it's her own fault for reporting it, would she..?"`
`Coach nodded quietly.`
`"...Satoko-chan would probably either hate it if you suggested reporting the abuse or feign courage and say you didn't need to. `
`And even if you reported it in secret... she'd probably insist to the social worker that she wasn't being abused."`
`...Satoko always acts tough and doesn't readily admit defeat—so I could imagine that easily.`
`"And the child consultation center has enormous authority in these matters, they can take emergency measures without needing any permission from a court or the concerned child. `
`...If the abuse was known to the public, they could forcibly shelter her even if she denied it.`
` ......For Satoko-chan... that would probably mean losing."`
`"T-This isn't about winning or losing!!`
` It's real life! Satoko, she's...!"`
`"...............Back on topic.`
` ...After they placed her under their protection, she would be sent to a child care institution or the like. `
`...She would basically be living there... so it would mean moving away.`
` ...And with the change in residence would come a change in schools, too."`
`"......That......`
` Changing schools...`
` It has to be done.`
` ...If that's what it will take for her to be safe."`
`"Satoko-chan understands all those things.`
` All the more reason for her not to want it."`
`"...Why?!"`
`...Try looking at it from Satoko-chan's point of view, rather than your own."`
`"......Umm......`
` mm......`
` ........."`
`...I felt like he was trying to confuse me with that hard-to-understand, roundabout way of talking so unique to adults.`
`The point was... that I couldn't do anything about Satoko wanting to stay in that house...`
`And that... I should watch... until she gives in.`
`...In the end...`
` no matter what I said... Coach himself was saying...`
` to wait and see.`
`"I...... I don't understand."`
`"...What?"`
`...She might not be happy with the result... and she might hate me for it.........`
` But I believe that will ultimately be what brings Satoko happiness."`
`Coach turned to me... and gazed fixedly into my eyes.`
`...It was written all over his face... He was shocked... at what such a young kid had said.`
`".........Why... why would you go that far..."`
`...Coach... no, rather, normal adults... might not have understood.`
`So I taught him the creed and the values that I believed in.`
`"Satoko is my friend.`
` ...And I am Satoko's Nii-nii... Isn't that enough of a reason...?"`
`I stared at him with a will strong and unbreakable as steel as his eyes betrayed a tiny bit of unrest.`
`"..................`
`...No... Of course that's enough."`
`...We were silent for a little while, until finally, Coach said only that.`
`"Didn't we make a promise?"`
`"...Umm............ I'm sorry... what...?"`
`"That we weren't going to ever let Satoko cry."`
`We made a vow on that day of the barbecue party.`
`...I didn't think about it hard at all... but Coach and I still made a promise.`
`...That we wouldn't ever let Satoko cry.`
`Coach gave a dry grin of regret, immediately apologizing for not remembering.`
`...One way or another... when he grinned like that... it made me think that his enthusiasm for saving Satoko... was a tiny bit smaller than mine...`
`He lightly hit the brakes, making a skidding noise, and my whole body suddenly fell forward.`
`"......Could that be your house there?`
` Oh... Right, Maebara-san would live at the Maebara residence, wouldn't he."`
`...Before I knew it... we were almost to my house.`
