`"Let's cut to the chase... is there a drug that causes someone to kill themselves?"`
`"Not directly, no."`
`"That's quite a roundabout response.`
` You mean that there's one that does it indirectly?"`
`"It's possible to induce a suicidal mental state,`
` is what I mean."`
`"...That's hard to say.`
` What would 'a suicidal mental state' be?"`
`Clinical depression and bipolar disorder are different.`
`Clinical depression indicates a prolonged state of depression,`
` whereas bipolar disorder is characterized by a passive depressed state accompanied by a very active manic state.`
`"Basically, even without a drug, one can succumb to an irregular mental state."`
`"The deceased was surrounded after being chased, and his life was in danger, right?`
`All that stress could have messed with his brain chemistry, he could have hit his head, and those factors combined might have caused him to mutilate himself. It's a possibility."`
`"...Could you explain it to me in simpler terms...?"`
`"Nahahahahahahah!!!`
` Guess this means the assailants didn't have any intent to kill.`
` They smacked him hoping to nick some change, and just happened to hit a bad place!"`
`The two plump men laughed hoarsely.`
`"...But of course, it's not like that."`
`"Ahem.`
` Undoubtedly..."`
`"Whether it was habitual drug use, or something mental, the deceased's background holds the key.`
` How's your investigation going?"`
`"Oh my goodness, look at the time!`
` I need to get back soon or Kuma-chan will get angry with me."`
`"Yeah!`
` Good luck!`
` Best wishes!"`
`"Best wishes!"`
