`The function of this school as an educational facility is very questionable.`
`Our PE class is exceptionally disorganized.`
`The only things we do together are the warm-ups at the start.`
`The teacher isn't even there after that.`
` All we do is play together.`
`"No helping it. Everybody's a different age or gender."`
`"The only rule was that we have to stay on school grounds while exercising."`
`All the little kids were gallivanting about.`
`Well... they certainly are being active. They might be getting plenty of exercise, but...`
`"...The board of education probably completely forgot about this school."`
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting."`
`"We're all together now. What shall we do today for PE!?"`
`"All right.`
` We have all of our members gathered now."`
`"Now then, Class Representative, what shall we do for PE today?`
` What shall we do?"`
`...Mion harrumphed and crossed her arms haughtily, surveying the area.`
`"Explosive power and endurance.`
` There are no friends in the world of sports.`
` Everyone is a rival! The only thing you can trust in is your own body!"`
`"What the heck do you mean by that? You really read too much manga."`
`I quipped without missing a beat.`
`"And so, we'll be taking a lesson from history!!`
` The tried and true king of all outdoor melee events...`
` Let's play tag!"`
`It was quite the adorable choice to make after playing it up so much.`
`"Just what I was hoping for~!!`
` That dunderhead Keiichi-san shall be the first one to be it!"`
`"...I won't be beaten."`
`"I'll try my best too! You can't beat me~!"`
`"...Why are you guys all so into it...?"`
`"The third rule of our society!! You must partake in the game, enjoying it without question!!!"`
`"Then... this counts as a club activity!?"`
`Everyone smirked at each other.`
`They all seemed pretty confident.`
` I'm a man.`
`Physically, I should be able to keep up with any girls my own age.`
`Regardless, Mion and Satoko looked like they were aiming for victory and Rena was looking at me as if pitying my disadvantage.`
`"...Fine. Tag,`
` I'm iiiiiiiiin!!!"`
`My yell echoed across the school grounds.`
`These were the rules:`
`Anyone who was able to evade being tagged before the bell was a winner.`
`But we didn't switch who was 'it.'`
` The ones who were tagged by 'it' also became 'it.'`
`So the number of people who were 'it' could increase exponentially.`
`The endgame would become a hellish siege.`
`"We call this version 'zombie tag,' you see."`
`"I see. Anyone infected by a zombie turns into a zombie."`
`"...Why do you make it sound so scary, I wonder?`
` ...I wonder?"`
`"As soon as I catch Rena, I'm going to tear out her entrails while she's still alive...!!"`
`"...G-G-Gr-Gross, Keiichi-kun, that's gross...!"`
`Rika-chan placed her hand on Rena's head as she panicked.`
`"...Don't worry. ...Before Keiichi gobbles you down, I'll eat you up gently."`
`"Rika, that isn't comforting at all."`
`Both Mion and I nodded deeply.`
`"So, the first 'it'... how do you decide who's the zombie?`
` ...With rock-paper-scissors?"`
`"Well, it is class time after all. Let's decide by answering questions.`
` I'll ask the questions, and the one who isn't able to answer is the zombie!"`
`I have no idea which grade level they're coming from.`
`"What does the Japanese word 「roku」 mean?"`
`Huh?`
` ...I was bewildered by the sudden question.`
`Mion repeated it.`
`"So you need to answer!`
` What's 「roku」 in English!?"`
`"Uhm, it's six!!"`
`"How about 「kutsushita」!?"`
`"Socks!"`
`"What's the third-last letter in the alphabet!?"`
`"...It's X."`
`"What does 「seibetsu」 mean!?"`
`"Of course I know what that is~!!`
`...`
`..."`
`Satoko cut herself off before finishing the answer.`
`...I see. It's quite a lewd question.`
`"You're an adult, aren't you~?`
` Of course you know what it is, right??"`
`"...I-I certainly do...!`
` Of course I know...!!"`
`"Then go ahead and say it.`
` 'That,' you know? 'That.'`
` What does 'that' mean, exactly?"`
`"...Hau... Satoko looks like she's in trouble...`
` How kyute..."`
`"Don't take her home. It's a crime."`
`If I didn't nip it in the bud, she really might have tried to take her home...`
`Mion's pursuit was relentless, making Satoko stammer.`
`"Now then, go ahead and say it, nice and loudly!!`
`What does 'that' mean!?!?"`
`"'That' means a previously indicated person, thing or event."`
`"Huh?`
` ...Ah."`
`All of us were a bit surprised by Rika-chan's unexpected answer.`
`I see. Well it certainly is what 'that' means.`
` ...That could have been awkward.`
`...I wonder what I would have done in Satoko's position.`
`...I'd probably get ticked off and just blurt out you-know-what at the top of my lungs...`
`I wouldn't want you as an enemy, Mion Sonozaki!`
`Thank goodness you were born a girl.`
`If you were a boy, you'd probably be a perverted asshole...`
`"It... It appears I have no choice.`
` ...Unfortunately, I, Satoko Houjou, shall assume the role of the zombie.`
` ...`
` I shall eat everyone~!!"`
`Seems like she's raring to go.`
`"All I must do is count to 100, correct!?"`
`"Some jerks skip numbers while counting to 100.`
` So you can start chasing after you solve this problem."`
`"Whoa, Keiichi-kun... give her a simple one, okay...?"`
`"1/5th of a cake, 1/6th of a cake, and 1/7th of a cake are all on a plate."`
`"Oh no!!`
` Th-There are no common denominators?!?!"`
`Satoko grabbed a stick in a panic and began drawing a cake and fractions on the ground.`
`"If Satoko, who can eat one cake in 60 seconds, eats all of them... how many cakes are left on the plate?"`
`Just as I finished giving the word problem, Mion shouted.`
`"Ready... go!!!!"`
`On Mion's signal, everyone but Satoko scattered.`
`"Heheh... Keiichi-kun,`
` that wasn't a problem at all, was it?"`
`Satoko had already lost the moment she started working it out.`
`She's eating it all, so of course there's nothing left on the plate!`
`Everyone dashed off in a direction they thought was best.`
`Knowing the lay of the land, they probably headed right to the best spots.`
`It was obvious I was at a disadvantage.`
`At a time like this, it would have been more effective to go along with those trained in survival skills...`
` Like Mion, for example.`
`...The fact that I didn't realize it at the start of the game probably hurt my chances.`
`Glancing back over the school grounds, I saw Satoko just rising up to start.`
`She was really, really mad.`
` Mwahaha!`
` ...She got tripped up on such a dumb question.`
`I stood at one of the corners of the school.`
`I had clear sightlines in two directions and would probably have a good response time if any zombies started closing in.`
`For the time being, I caught my breath and focused on what I was trained to think during club activities yesterday.`
`...Now think calmly, Keiichi Maebara...`
` If I was 'it,' what would I do?`
`Increasing my numbers would be the shortcut to victory.`
`...Then going after the weakest player first is the obvious plan of attack.`
`Meaning... me!`
`"Now then, where could Keiichi-san possibly be!?`
` I shan't let you escape!!!"`
`...But of course.`
`What would be the best method to track me down?`
`Footprints or smell... or maybe some type of trail.`
`If I could craftily hide my tracks... then there would be no trail for Satoko to follow!`
`But I was no detective... Would I even be able to do that kind of thing in an amateur game like this?`
`"Tomita~ Okamura~!`
` Have you seen Keiichi-san recently!?"`
`Wh-What the heeeeeck!?!?`
`Do zombies hunt their prey by asking nicely where they went!?!?`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun pointed to the location where I was hiding.`
`After confirming she was headed in this direction, I abandoned my position.`
`It wasn't easy to hide myself with all those little kids running around as they pleased.`
`It was becoming even more obvious that I was at a disadvantage from not being familiar with these surroundings...!`
`If that's how it was going to be... Then to confront this intelligence-gathering zombie, I'd just counter it in a similar vein...!!`
`I approached some girls playing with a ball.`
`"...I'm sorry, but could you relay this message?`
` Tell Satoko Houjou that her parents are at the gate,`
` please."`
`"Message, message, ahahaha~~!!`
` Okay okay!"`
`I stopped the girls as they turned to run off.`
`"Wait, don't go yet!`
` Also, take this one to Mion Sonozaki.`
` Tell her the teacher is calling her to the gate."`
`Mwahaha, I am quite the schemer, if I do say so myself...!`
`If things went well, then Satoko and Mion would run into each other at the gate!!`
`It would put me at a disadvantage if more people were 'it,' but this was Mion we were talking about.`
` She'd figure out a way to escape.`
`...But that was just fine.`
` As long as it bought me more time...!!`
`Mwahaha, dance for me, Mion and Satoko!!`
` In the palm of my haaaaaand!!!`
`Having my fill of playing the conman, I looked for a place to hide.`
`If you think about it logically, I'd only bought myself a scant amount of time.`
` ...And it might even come back to bite me...!`
`Once it became apparent I'd started spreading false information through messengers, I could end up being the recipient of one of those 'messages.'`
`Satoko would probably ask the messengers to help her look for me.`
`That would mean... there would be more zombies than participants in the game!!`
`The virus that was brought about by my mischief could cause an epidemic...`
`All my classmates would transform into zombies... and would only be searching for me!`
`...This tactic...`
` This tactic might backfire horribly.`
`While trembling at the thought of the impending Dawn of the Dead, I began searching for a safehouse.`
`I found a shed by the incinerator behind the school.`
`After climbing up to the roof, I held my breath.`
`It wasn't a bad place to hold out.`
`Not only did I have good line of sight but, if necessary, I could jump off in three different directions to escape!`
`It was getting rowdy down there.`
` The lower grades were running around below the shed.`
`"Maebara-san isn't around.`
` Is he over there?"`
`"Nope~`
` Where's Keiichi-san, I wonder?`
` His dad is at the front gate."`
`That was definitely a lie.`
`The word, "gate," the same one I'd used, gave a hint of revenge.`
` So Mion was behind this...!`
`I was still keeping one step ahead of the game.`
` I felt bad for my underclassmen, but they'd have to search until the school bell.`
`"Hey, hey, do you know where Keiichi-san is at~?`
` His mom suddenly got really sick~!"`
`"A message for Maebara-san.`
` They said his house caught fire and he needs to come to the gate!"`
`"A jumbo jet fell on top of the Maebara residence!"`
`"The police have come to question him!"`
`...Anything goes now.`
`"Whaaat!?"`
`GaaaaaaaAAaaRRRrrrrggh!!!!!`
`This was your doing, Mionnnnnnn!!!`
`C-Calm down, Keiichi Maebara!!`
` This is Mion's battle tactic to flush me out!`
` Just hold on!!`
`If my underclassmen thought about it logically, they would know it's all nonsense!`
`...But small kids don't think about things logically.`
`To them, all of those things were true, so they all chuckled together while looking for me.`
`Heheheheh...`
` Bwahahahaha...!`
` I win, Mion!`
` It's my victory!`
` Bwahahahaha...!!`
`Wiping unrelenting tears away, I felt intoxicated by my own victory...`
`The cost of beating Mion had too high a price...`
`Ah!`
` ...Oh.`
` Someone passed below.`
`That's... Rena and Rika-chan.`
`"...Haah haah.`
` Rika-chan, you're still okay!?"`
`"...I'm getting by somehow."`
`"...Haah haah.`
` ...It seems Mii-chan is 'it,' as well..."`
`Mion!?`
` It couldn't be... She'd become 'it' because of my little strategy!?`
`This confirmed that Mion was behind this relentless message war.`
` ...Then... This wasn't good...`
`"We finally got away from Mii-chan, but Satoko-chan... She's..."`
`"...Satoko is searching around the pipes... so we should be safe here for a while."`
`Upon hearing that, I breathed a sigh of relief.`
`While Rena was slumped on the ground breathing heavily, Rika-chan had started creeping up to her...`
`Rika-chan doesn't normally make noise when she walks...`
` but it's strange.`
` ...It couldn't be...`
`"Whoa!?`
` ...Rika-chan?`
` ...What is it? What is it!?`
` ...Haoh...!?"`
`"...Don't worry."`
`I had never seen Rika-chan smile so creepily before.`
`"Wh-Why are you coming closer? Why!?`
` Rika-chan isn't... a zombie, is she!?"`
`"...Don't be scared...`
` I'll be sure to...`
` eat you, gently."`
`"N-N-N-No way!?`
` ...Rika-chan, no... Eeeek...!!"`
`Rena was pressed against the wall and Rika-chan lurched forward with both arms out, just like a zombie...`
`Rena quaked with her back pushed up against the wall.`
`It was quite a surreal scene of horror...`
`Like one of those zombie breakout videos you'd see.`
`At that moment, Rena's eyes met mine.`
`"K-Keiichi-kun! Save meeee!!!"`
`Zombie Rika-chan turned 180 degrees, Exorcist-style, and glared at me!`
`"Found him!! I see Kei-chan!!!!"`
`Mion popped out from behind the cinderblock wall around the garbage dump, also seeing where I was.`
`My position was only advantageous when there was one zombie. Being surrounded was not as good!!!`
`"You said you located Keiichi-san~~!?!?"`
`I could tell that Satoko was rushing my way.`
`It seemed that Rika-chan had let Rena escape, and now she was baring her fangs in my direction.`
`"Uuurgh~... oooough~..."`
`"...Come~ on~ down~... Keiiiiiii-chaAaaAan..."`
`The three zombies circled the shed, moaning curses.`
`"Y... You guys are scary!!!`
` Too scary!!!"`
`"I wonder how Keiichi-san's guts taste!!`
` Keichi-saAaAn...!"`
`"...Keiichi... I want you to become one of us."`
`"S-S-S-Someone please save meeeee!!!!!"`
`I saw Rena apologizing to me from across the schoolyard.`
`An apology.`
` Sorry.`
` Leaving me for dead?`
` ...R-Renaaaa!!!!!`
`I leapt off the roof out of fear,`
` slipping as I landed.`
`Satoko and Rika jumped on top of me and, after straddling me... they tickled me, all over my body.`
`"Gwa ha ha ha!!!`
` Stop! Stop!!`
` Gwaaaah!!!!!"`
`"...So this means Rena is still left.`
` There isn't much time until the bell."`
`"...Damn you, Renaaa...!!`
` How dare you... leave me for deaaaad!!"`
`The feelings of a zombie.`
` I understood how vengeful ghosts with lingering regrets felt.`
`"...It's sad, so sad.`
` ...But Keiichi is one of us now."`
`It felt like I'd been bitten by a vampire and was now one of their thralls.`
`It was a strange feeling, being welcomed over to the side that had pursued me.`
`"...Zombie tag is quite profound!"`
`"This is no time to postulate!!`
` We must capture Rena!!!"`
`"The principal is walking down the hall.`
` ...The bell will ring soon!!"`
`To devour Rena... I, who had been turned into a demon of vengeance, needed to use any means necessary.`
`Except I wasn't just a zombie.`
` I was a master of the night... A vampire!!`
`Using the same trick that had tightened the noose around my own neck, I used my classmates to further my evil designs.`
`I gathered up the lower grades from around the school grounds.`
`"Everyone, listen!`
` Rena's in big trouble!`
` All of you, please look for Rena!"`
`"...It's a bigger problem than a jumbo jet crashing into your family's house?"`
`...Oh, yeah, it had turned into that, hadn't it.`
` Mion whistled nonchalantly, trying to avoid the blame.`
`It seemed I'd made them fully understand that the fight for Earth was lost without Rena.`
`"Now scatter, comrades!! We must find Rena!!!"`
`My comrades in the lower grades let out an enthusiastic cheer and dashed off in various directions around the school grounds.`
`...Hm?`
` There was still one person who hadn't gone.`
`"...Ryuugu-san is amazing..."`
`Satisfied with that, she also rushed off to look for Rena.`
`...It does seem... like there are some promising up-and-comers amongst the youngsters.`
`"...Little Kei-chan's abilities... this old man knows them better now..."`
`It didn't really feel like she was complimenting me, but whatever.`
`"...Really, though... How exceptional, Keiichi-san...!!`
` This looks quite promising!!"`
`"If we have this many... we can win!!`
` With this many, we will win!!"`
`"...I was thinking that Keiichi would have been a better nominee for the initial zombie."`
`Rika-chan's words stung a bit, but I'd let it slide for now...`
`Not even Rena would be able to escape the entire class.`
`As a result of everyone's thorough search, Rena was finally cornered in the back of the sports equipment shed.`
`"Y-You're all scary!!`
` Keiichi-kun, too...!!`
` So scary!!!"`
`It probably was scary being chased around by the entire student body.`
`All the lower grades closed in on Rena, saying she was the only one who could save the world.`
`"Renaaa, how could you leave me for deeaad?!!`
` Are you ready to pay for it...!?!?"`
`"I-I-I'm sorry about that, Keiichi-kun ...b-b-but I didn't have a choice...!!"`
`"Do not resist... Let yourself be devoured~...!!!"`
`"...Let's all... be together."`
`"Now, Rena... Say your prayers!!`
` Mwa ha ha!!!!!"`
`Rena had stumbled onto a mat, trembling, with tears in her eyes.`
` I closed in.`
`Associating this situation with a similar, particularly immoral one made my pulse quicken just a little bit.`
`...Satoko and Rika-chan were both wiggling their fingers.`
` They probably wanted to tickle Rena.`
`Rena, wanting no part of what she knew was about to happen, went stiff with fear.`
`"...K-Keiichi-kun... you wouldn't do mean things like everyone else... would you?`
` ...Would you?"`
`"...I woOoOnder~!?!?"`
`"...Uu... ah... hau..."`
`"...Nowww then... Are you reaAaAady!?"`
`"...Okay... so long as it's Keiichi-kun..."`
`The face she made as she resigned herself to her fate made my heart skip a beat.`
`"I-I believe... that Keiichi-kun won't... do horrible things to me..."`
`...Argh... Body... won't move... That had to be some sort of anti-zombie mantra.`
`The second my sense of reason chimed in, the beast inside me died instantly.`
`There was the bell! Game over.`
`"Yaaay~~!!`
` I did it, I did it!!`
` I survived!`
` Yaaay~ Yaaaa~y☆!!"`
`Rena pranced around merrily as if a curse had been broken.`
`"...Heh, so daylight broke in the nick of time and the evil zombie army disintegrated into dust...`
` And so, the heroine survived... Well, that's how it goes in the movies, anyway..."`
`"What are you postulating about!?`
` This is all because Keiichi-san was dawdling about!"`
`"...Punishment is required."`
`I was subdued by Satoko and Rika-chan and once again sentenced to death by one hundred tickles.`
`"Eeeeeek! F-Forgive me! Eeeeeeek!"`
`"Then the award for surviving goes to Rena Ryuugu and Mion Sonozaki. Yaay!"`
`"Huh...? Mii-chan wasn't a zombie...?"`
`"Only pretended to be one. They say you need to deceive your allies before you can deceive the enemy, you know~?"`
`"...Uroooogh! Mion~ you little!"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` Hurry up and change, all right~?`
` Don't be late for the next class~!"`
`"Let go of me, Satoko! Rika-chan!!`
` GwaaAaaAaa...ah...!!!!"`
`Having had my fill of being terrified to my very core by club activities, I solemnly swore I would have Mion crying for mercy next time.`
`After arriving home, I quickly made preparations to head out once again.`
`"Mom, do we have work gloves? I need towels, too."`
`"Aren't they in the shed out back?`
` The towels are by the sink."`
`All right. Now I was all ready.`
` ...Looking at me, my mom stared quizzically.`
`"What's going on, Keiichi?`
` Where are you headed to in that getup...?"`
`"A bit of excavating.`
` So my classmate doesn't become a criminal."`
`"...Well, don't be out too late."`
`Mom returned to the kitchen with a puzzled expression still on her face.`
`Cutting through the woods as a shortcut to the dam site, I ran into someone.`
`It was Tomitake-san.`
`Probably taking pictures of wild birds again with that precious camera of his.`
`...It couldn't be that all he took pictures of was handsome young men in the twilight...??`
`"Hey, long time no see.`
` Keiichi-kun, right?"`
`"My due regards."`
`I expelled the rude imagery from my head and greeted him without inciting anything.`
`"By the way...`
` Was that girl an acquaintance of yours...?"`
`He was probably talking about Rena.`
` Guessing by the way Tomitake-san was shaken up...`
`That was Rena, without a doubt.`
`I expect that she was grinning in anticipation of taking Colonel Randy home.`
`"I hid myself because I thought it might be dangerous`
` ...`
`Should I call the cops to be safe...!?"`
`Tomitake-san's reaction was the epitome of logical.`
`"It's fine, it's fine.`
` Just leave her be.`
` She's just wandering around looking for more victims."`
`Tomitake-san was alarmed by my crass response.`
`Well, it's probably hard for normal people to understand Rena.`
` I'll just toss out a bunch of baloney.`
`"If you were to be killed out here, she'd probably be the one to do it.`
` ...Try not to snoop too much around here."`
`With a condescending smirk, I started off in the direction of the dam site where Rena was waiting.`
`Before I got too far, Tomitake-san abruptly called out to me.`
`"Keiichi-kun, is that meant to be a warning for an outsider like me?"`
`...Uhhh, I didn't mean that seriously. I did try to make it obvious, but...`
`"Hah hah hah!`
` I'll try my best to be careful."`
`Leaving only those words behind, Tomitake-san turned around and left.`
`I didn't really mean to call him an outsider...`
` I wasn't really implying anything when I said that...`
`It was only meant to be a joke, but it felt like I'd said something bad...`
`"Keiichi-kun~!`
` I was waiting for you. Let's try our best today!"`
`I understood what Tomitake-san was trying to say.`
`"Seems that I lost it... so there isn't one."`
`Thinking about it, there really was no need to try to keep up appearances.`
`Everyone in Hinamizawa probably already knew about Rena's eccentricities.`
`"Ah well!`
` Let's finish this today!`
` If we bust through this last beam, we should be able to pull him out.`
` I've got everything I need.`
` Leave it to me!"`
`"Okay!"`
`"All right, get back.`
` ...I'll finish this in one gooooo!"`
`A solid "thwack" rang through out Hinamizawa, as if the job was being done by a lumberjack.`
`"...How is it?`
` Think you can do it?`
` If it looks too hard, you don't have to strain yourself..."`
`"If I can break through this, then we'll be good!`
` I have plenty of power today!`
` I can do it!"`
`...But this adversary was more formidable than I expected.`
`During a school camping trip, I had wanted to split the wood, but I lost at rock-paper-scissors and wasn't able to do it.`
`Because the spot where I was standing was so unstable, I soon became tired and decided to take a break.`
`Rena had already spread out a tarp and laid down some tea and sweets.`
`"Come to think of it... Rena, you're a transfer student too, right?`
` Where did you live before?"`
`I asked her nonchalantly while drinking tea.`
`I had thought she'd lived here all her life.`
`"Hm?`
` In Kanto.`
` It wasn't as rural as it is out here, but it was still out in the countryside."`
`"Why did you move here?`
` To Hinamizawa, I mean.`
` You know, this is pretty far out in the boonies."`
`"Why did you move here?`
` Does it have to do with your dad's work?"`
`"Dad said he wanted to relocate his studio.`
` He'd been saying for a while that somewhere deep in the mountains like this would be perfect."`
`"Studio? ...Is your father an artist or something??"`
`"He paints scenery.`
` Seems that twice a year he opens a gallery for the stuff he does."`
`When he started, his works were displayed in an industry plaza in Tokyo, but now they're exhibited in the Makuhari Messe.`
`He's determined to have them displayed in the Waterfront International Exhibition Hall.`
`"That's amazing!`
` Let me see them next time!"`
`...I was too embarrassed to tell her that I didn't really know what kind of pictures my father painted...`
`Well, eventually I would. I picked myself up while giving some vague answers.`
`"But... you transferred in the middle of the semester, didn't you?`
` Wasn't that a hassle?"`
`"Not really.`
` ...I was getting bored of the city anyway."`
`I was trying to get answers from Rena, but I ended up being the one giving out all the answers.`
`The air grew colder as the sun slowly set.`
`The higurashi began their song, as if to tell me to stop and head home for the day.`
`Just a bit more.`
` Today... I would end it!`
`When I first started, I chatted with Rena as I worked, but now I didn't have that luxury.`
`"Hooyah!`
` You little...!`
` Damn it!"`
`"The assailants butchered the victim's body with hatchets and pickaxes."`
`I recalled that passage from the tabloid.`
`One hit with something like this would smash someone's head in...`
`Axes and pickaxes are not meant to be swung at people, ever.`
`With one last swing, the beam cracked apart.`
`The arm came off with a sickening sound.`
`It clattered down noisily, stopping at my feet.`
`"...Ah."`
`"Wh-What's the matter!? Are you hurt!?"`
`"S-Sorry...`
` The figure's arm... I broke it off..."`
`"...Oh, that's all? I thought Keiichi-kun hurt himself."`
`I probably had a really guilty look on my face.`
` Rena said that without a hint of dismay as she smiled.`
`"We just need to tape it back on and put a coat over him.`
` Nobody will even notice."`
`"...I see. Let's pull him out then.`
` Can you get that side?"`
`"Okay!"`
`Both Rena and Mion knew how sickening that incident was.`
`So they pretended that they didn't know.`
`I had looked it up all by myself.`
`...And shamefully enough, I was scared.`
`"...You're pathetic, Keiichi Maebara!`
` All right, Rena!`
` Let's do this in one go!`
` Ready... and...!"`
`"...Whoa!`
` We did it! We did it, Keiichi-kun!`
` Yaaay!"`
`The right time to give three cheers!`
` That moment of two days of work bearing fruit.`
`He who was brought to Hinamizawa covered in filth to meet his end. Instead, we were able to welcome him back.`
`It didn't matter that he was dirty. Rena nuzzled him cheerfully with her cheek.`
`I was dead tired, but seeing Rena's happy face made it all worth it.`
`"I'll help you carry it back. It'd be bad if it gets dark."`
`"...Yeah. Right!`
` I really want to thank you, Keiichi-kun! I won't forget this!"`
`"I'll think real hard about how you can repay me!"`
`"Wh... Whoa... I wonder what kind of 'repayment'?`
` ...I wonder?"`
