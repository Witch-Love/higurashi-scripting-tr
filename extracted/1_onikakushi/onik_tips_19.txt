`"I see it in movies quite often, but what is it, exactly?"`
`"Multiple personalities are thought to be escapism."`
`"Multiple personality disorder is a form of escape?"`
`"Correct.`
` The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to be a type of defense for the brain to retain mental stability."`
`"Hypothetically, poor people imagining themselves as wealthy is a form of escapism, is it not?`
` Is this also a form of multiple personality disorder?"`
`"I wouldn't go that far, but broadly speaking, one could infer that.`
` It's something that occurs in us all."`
`"Does a split personality occur when one cannot tell which is reality and which is the escape?"`
`"...That's difficult to say.`
` There are some who agree with that, and some who disagree.`
` There is no consensus."`
`"Then is the occurrence of multiple personalities still an unknown phenomenon... something not fully comprehended in the psychiatric field?"`
`"Unfortunately, that is the current state of things.`
` We can only put our hope in future research."`
`"But, but~ It's sorta cool having a split personality~!`
` What kind of people get split personalities?"`
`"Recent studies find that those who develop it... or rather, those who are more susceptible to developing it,`
` may be genetically predisposed or may have had abnormal mental development... `
`Some say that childhood abuse increases the chances."`
`"Speaking of which, Person A here experienced abuse as a child, didn't he~ How sad~..."`
`"Person A has seven different personalities.`
` Let's watch a video of him...`
` Right after these commercials!!"`
