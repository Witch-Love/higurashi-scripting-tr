`The smoking room was filled with a cloud of cigarette smoke.`
`The expensive smoke filter gave off some crackling electric noise, but it didn't seem like it was doing anything at all.`
`Why do smokers have to be shoved so far down this corridor where the sun didn't even reach?`
`...I recalled hearing that the tax revenue from tobacco was about a tenth of the municipality's revenue...`
`We were the most heavily-taxed members of this municipality, so I really wished they'd show us a little more respect...`
`"...Hrm, why would you discard the 5 manzu there?`
` It's just decreasing your options."`
`One of the younger detectives was having a staring contest with the Mahjong magazine called "Next Turn."`
`"You're still in tenpai if you cut the 5 manzu."`
`"If you're betting on a Haitei, then shouldn't you be going into it with a Mangan?"`
`"Kuma-chan, look at the pond.`
` They all discarded a 5 manzu. It's a safe tile.`
` You'd hate if, at end game, someone was sitting on a tenpai on the last turn, wouldn't you?"`
`The kid let out another groan, put out his cigarette, then took out another one.`
`"...I just don't agree...`
` Why would you reduce your own options?"`
`"By the way, you can't call ron with your winning tile in that haitei."`
`"What!? Why is that!?"`
`Just then, I heard a voice coming from down the hall.`
`"Are you here, Ooishi-san?`
` You have a call from a civilian."`
`"Whoa, ain't that something? Welp, see ya soon!"`
`"W-Why can't you call ron on it!?`
` H-Hold on for a second, Ooishi-san!"`
`The man sitting in the seat Ooishi-san was heading towards waved at the telephone receiver.`
`"Outside line.`
` From a payphone."`
`"Oh, why thank you!`
` ...Sorry to keep you waiting, this is Ooishi.`
` Who is it?"`
`"Ah, Ooishi-san!?`
` Hello!?"`
`"If it isn't Maebara-san.`
` Why, good evening...!"`
`From the tone Maebara-kun's voice, I already knew he was in a predicament.`
`...This was the first time Maebara-kun had phoned me.`
`And he was calling from a payphone.`
`"Please calm down.`
` Did something happen?"`
`"Uh,`
` well`
` ...Ahh...!!!"`
`His voice was erratic over the line, he had completely lost his sense of composure.`
`After checking that nobody else could hear, I prompted him in a hushed tone.`
`"What happened!?"`
`"UhhhUhhm... I... I... I..."`
`"...Calm down, Maebara-san!`
` I can have the local officers head to your location.`
` I'll be there soon, too!"`
`"...Ah, um...`
` ...`
` I think that's`
` ...impossible."`
`His voice was quivering and hoarse...`
`...He wasn't surrounded by people even as he was making this call, was he!?`
`"Maebara-san, you're calling from a payphone right now, right?`
` Where is that payphone!?"`
`There were no other sounds besides Maebara-kun's voice.`
`It had to be a phone booth.`
`I scratched out a note and thrust it at my colleague sitting across from me.`
`(Hinamizawa, phone booth!!)`
`He understood quickly and hastily started on the internal lines.`
`"...Calm down, Maebara-san!`
` What is your current situation...!?"`
`It was best practice to avoid flustering someone panicking... but this was an urgent case.`
`...Maebara-kun didn't just get in trouble, get away, and then call me.`
`...He was in the midst of something dangerous right now...!`
`But... yelling at Maebara-kun right now would just needlessly cause him to be even more frantic.`
`Maebara-kun wasn't just calling to seek help.`
`...He was trying to tell us something more than that.`
`And whatever that was...`
` If I didn't get it from this call, I was certain there would never be another chance...!`
`My colleague pushed a note in front of me.`
`(There's only one booth in Hinamizawa.`
` A patrol car is on the way.`
` Five minutes.)`
`"That's too long.`
` How many officers are in there?"`
`"Two."`
`Not enough.`
`...If it was as I imagined... there were likely quite a few people surrounding Maebara-kun.`
`Five minutes was too long!`
`"Did you call the officer stationed in Hinamizawa!?"`
`"He's scheduled to be on patrol.`
` They're currently out, and it'll be impossible to contact them."`
`"God damn!`
` Kuma-chan, bring the car around."`
`"Understood!!!"`
`"...Hello?`
` Ooishi-san...?`
` *Cough cough*!!"`
`"Hello!`
` It's all right.`
` I can hear you loud and clear!"`
`There was something wrong with Maebara-kun...`
`That wasn't a normal coughing sound.`
`...Vomiting?`
`Or was it... blood!?`
`Had he already been attacked!? Was he injured!?`
`"Maebara-san, the police are on their way.`
` They'll be there in a couple of minutes, so hold on somehow!`
` Hello!?`
` Can you hear me!?`
` Maebara-san!?"`
`I could hear on the other end of the line that he was having a coughing fit.`
`...The worst possible situation popped into my head.`
`"Maebara-san!!`
` Who is the culprit!?`
` How many are there!?"`
`"...I...`
` I thought...`
` at first the culprit was human...`
` *hack*!!"`
`I couldn't tell if that was a cough or vomiting.`
`"Are you all right!? Maebara-san!!"`
`"I thought that`
` the culprit was a person`
` and not Oyashiro-sama's curse...`
` Up until right now.`
` But...`
` ...`
` I guess... in the end...`
` *hack hack*...!!"`
`It was an intense bout of coughing.`
` Then vomiting.`
`"...But...`
` I guess...`
` Oyashiro-sama`
` does exist...`
` No, he's...`
` here."`
`"Maebara-san, please, just please calm down..."`
`"I had been thinking it was strange for a while now...`
` It's been following me this whole time...!!`
`I run and run and run and run...!!!`
` But it just sticks to me like my shadow!!`
` But slowly... so slowly...`
` It's digging itself into my back..."`
`"...Maebara-san...`
` Are they...`
` right now...`
` perhaps...`
` right behind you...?"`
`"...Behind me.`
` Right... behind me..."`
`"Please, Maebara-san...`
` I can tell you're scared.`
` But please!!`
` ...Who is it... that's right behind you!?"`
`"I can't just... look behind me...`
` If I do... I'll...`
` I'll..."`
`"I understand that you're scared!!`
` But please tell me!!`
` You just need to turn around a bit!!`
` Who is it...?`
` Who is behind you, Maebara-san!?!?"`
`Right after I said that, I could hear him vomiting intensely.`
` What followed was a nightmarish sound.`
`"...Maebara-san...`
` It couldn't be that you're...`
` clawing out... your own throat...?"`
`There was no answer.`
`But... I could hear something like scratching...`
`There was a bang, as if something was being hit!`
`...Maebara-kun had probably dropped the receiver.`
`I could hear groaning and vomiting over on the other end, and a repeating... abnormal noise.`
`"Hello?`
` Hello!?`
` Maebara-san!?`
` Helloooo!?!?"`
`I knew how far away my voice would sound on the other end.`
`But... I couldn't help but shout.`
`At that moment, I heard whispering... coming from the other end.`
`I couldn't tell what he was saying.`
`...From the way he was saying it, was he... talking to himself?`
`Or was he... talking to someone there?`
`"Hello...?`
` ...Maebara...san...?"`
`Rather than whispering... it was some kind of mantra he was chanting over and over.`
`I focused my senses... trying to pick up what he was saying...`
`What was he repeating...?`
`What... exactly...!?`
`Beep!`
`Suddenly, the line went dead.`
` Did he use up his time...!?`
`It was because it was a payphone...!!`
`"...Ah."`
`It was because it cut out so abruptly...`
`The last thing he said came out so clearly in my mind.`
`"Ooishi-san, the car is good to go!!!`
` Ooishi-san...!?"`
`"...It was... I'm sorry."`
`"Ooishi-san...??"`
`That's what he was repeating over and over.`
`...He said, "I'm sorry"...`
`I had a gut feeling...`
`There was no longer a need to hurry.`
`...I could hear the chirp of the higurashi... spilling in from the open window.`
`Kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee...`
`I should have been able to hear them this entire time...`
` I just wasn't paying any attention.`
`Why did I focus on them all of a sudden?`
`Kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee...`
`Were they trying to tell me something?`
`Only the higurashi knew.`
` ...That's how I felt.`
`June, 1983`
`In Hinamizawa, a remote village near Shishibone city, there was a murder involving two female students.`
`The suspect is: Keiichi Maebara (Aged 1x)`
`The suspect called over his two female classmates`
` (Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki) to his house, and beat them to death with a metal bat.`
`The scene of the crime was the suspect's room on the second floor of his house.`
`The inside of the room was covered with a significant quantity of splattered blood, and there were signs of a struggle with the victims.`
`In addition to the scene of the crime, the entryway, living room, and kitchen, all had traces of a struggle.`
`At the entryway, the shoe rack and wall had evidence of being impacted by a strong blunt force.`
`It is believed to have been the same bat as the murder weapon.`
` Having no traces of blood, it is believed the destruction occurred before the murders.`
`There is the possibility that the suspect overpowered his victims to keep them from fleeing.`
`In the living room, the rug had been pulled back, then thrown aside.`
`It is hard to believe that this had a connection to the struggle with the victims, and thus the reason for this remains unknown.`
`In the kitchen, the garbage bag was torn apart, and its contents were spread out on the floor.`
`Garbage was strewn about in the surrounding area, and handprints believed to belong to the suspect were discovered.`
`It is believed that the suspect had for some reason taken out the garbage and struck it with his fists.`
`The reason for this remains unknown.`
`In addition, there was a note stuck to the fridge. The words "Was there a needle?" were written on it.`
`The meaning behind this remains unclear.`
` Just in case, the garbage was searched, but a needle was not discovered.`
`Though the garage door was functional, it had been left open ever since the suspect moved in. The garage door was found closed.`
`The suspect's fingerprints were discovered on the garage door.`
`The reason behind this remains unknown.`
`The suspect fled the scene of the crime.`
` However, a patrolling officer (Hinamizawa Local PD) found the suspect collapsed inside a phone booth.`
`At the time of discovery, the suspect was unconscious in critical condition.`
`He was rushed to the local hospital for treatment, but did not regain consciousness and died 24 hours later.`
`The results of the autopsy indicate the immediate cause of death to have been hypovolemic shock.`
`It was determined that the suspect had clawed at his own throat with his fingernails, and the resulting bleeding caused his death.`
`With the similarity to the death of Tomitake-san the prior week, the police believe there to be a connection and have opened an investigation.`
`(However, due to the wishes of the local authorities, it will be a confidential investigation.)`
`Due to the abnormal nature of the death, it was suspected that drugs were involved. But as with Tomitake-san, no traces were discovered.`
`What prompted all this remains inexplicable. As such, this case is being treated as an act committed on impulse.`
`However, with several accounts of the suspect's bizarre behavior leading up to the incident, it is possible that this was premeditated.`
`Separated from his group of friends. Isolation. Inexplicable behavior.`
`Several days before the incident, the suspect began carrying around a metal bat.`
`The suspect was observed displaying aggressive behavior, as well as talking to himself at school. His classmates have actually heard portions of what he was saying.`
`Two days before the incident, the suspect declared to his parents the possibility of his death.`
`Due to these circumstances, the police have begun an investigation on the possibility that this crime was not committed on impulse, but was instead planned several days in advance.`
`Afterwards...`
` A note was found in the suspect's room that he had written himself.`
`The note was written on two sheets from a B5 college-ruled notebook that had each been torn in half.`
`And as if trying to conceal it`
` was stuck hidden behind a clock on the wall.`
`The contents are as written in the appendix.`
`The police believe it to be strongly related to the incident.`
`The police changed their line of investigation based on the possibility that the suspect was involved in some sort of incident himself.`
`However, no further clues were found, casting doubt on the credibility of the note.`
`Was the crime impulsive or premeditated?`
` With the situation unclear and no further developments, the case has been labeled as 'Unresolved.'`
`However... the following year,`
` suspicion arose regarding the nature of the note.`
`The note was not written on two halves of B5 paper from two separate sheets...`
`but was originally a single sheet of B5 paper.`
`In order to erase several lines from the middle, someone had...`
` torn them out.`
`Judging from the size of the letters, the missing section is estimated to be 2-3 lines.`
`It is highly probable that the person who eliminated the lines in question is not the suspect.`
`In addition, judging from traces of large quantities of cellophane tape being stuck to the back of the clock,`
` speculation that something other than the note was stuck there, has arisen.`
`The person who first discovered the crime was a detective rumored to have a connection with the incident: Kuraudo Ooishi.`
`He underwent voluntary questioning, but denies involvement in any damages to the note.`
`The suspect's note:`
`I, Keiichi Maebara, am in fear for my life.`
`I do not know why they are after my life.`
`The only thing I do know is that it has to do with Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`Rena and Mion are conspirators of the perpetrators.`
` There are four or five adults, maybe more.`
` They have a white van.`
`(This is all on the first sheet. The section below this has been ripped out.)`
`(This is from the second sheet. The section above this has been ripped out.)`
`I have no idea why it has become like this.`
`If you are reading this, then I am probably already dead.`
` ...Though you may or may not find my body.`
`You, who are reading this. Please uncover the truth.`
` That is my only desire.`
`Keiichi Maebara`
