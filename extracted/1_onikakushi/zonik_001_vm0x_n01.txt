`Mion then lowered her hand to about 1 meter above the ground.`
`"But you've only known me for a month..."`
`"You've grown up so magnificently...`
` All the trouble this old man had to go through was worth it."`
`She gently took out a handkerchief and pretended to weep into it.`
`Just what is she trying to pull off at 8 o'clock in the morning...?`
`"Wasn't it me who went through the trouble there?!"`
`"You've grown up so much, you even have a beard~!"`
`"My beard hasn't started growing yet!"`
`"No, it's already growing. You got yourself a razor for it last week, right?"`
`"That was my father's... Wait, how do you know that?"`
`Mion sneered at the question, and then wagged her index finger right in my face.`
`...Just what is she playing at?`
`"Hahaha, NEVER underestimate Mion-san's intelligence gathering skills!`
` From your last meal to Rena's measurements, this old man knows it all."`
`My interest piqued, I placed my hand on her shoulder while she was still smirking.`
`"...I'll bite, what are Rena's measurements?"`
`"Just as I thought, you really want to knoooow?`
` By the way, it's expensive~ How much would you pay?"`
`Catching on to our awful discussion, Rena became flustered and began to ramble in a near panic.`
`"Don't you ignore me too, Rena! I'll put out a village-wide circular saying how you two are madly in love!"`
`"Keiichi-san's lunch box is most assuredly a plain, miserly rice and seaweed~!`
` Why don't you just show it to us? Come now!"`
