`"A Colonel Randy!?`
` Ah~ Of course that's right up her alley!"`
`"...I understand her wanting to take home Satoko and Rika-chan.`
` But I can't understand the Colonel Randy! What's so good about that four-eyed geezer!?"`
`Probably so she could dig out that 'kyute' Colonel Randy that she wasn't able to take home yesterday.`
`The excavation of Colonel Randy was probably taking her a while.`
`It looked like Colonel Randy was lodged in there pretty firmly.`
`"But there was a report Colonel Randy was buried alive in the trash pile...!"`
`"Okay, now move out of the way.`
` So where is Colonel Randy?"`
`The Colonel Randy was sideways, surrounded by boards and other construction materials, like they were caging him inside.`
`"...But... Colonel Randy... so kyute...`
` There's a chain on the Colonel Randy at the store... This one, though... I should be able to take this one home...`
` Hau..."`
`If Rena gave up on this Colonel Randy, she'll probably start devising a plan to steal the one in front of the store...`
`Even though I could see Colonel Randy right there!!`
`...With hatchets.`
` ...With pickaxes.`
` ...With... a hatchet.`
`"AhhHhhhHhHhhh!!!"`
`"Eek! S-S-Sorry...!!!`
` Did I startle you!? Did I startle you!?"`
`Rena dropped the hatchet she was holding onto the grass after being startled by my voice.`
`"Keiichi-kun, you see, earlier, yeah, you said it would help if you had an axe or something, didn't you!?`
` S-So then I... brought a hatchet for you... from the shed...!!"`
`"Doesn't look like we can break that last beam without that hatchet.`
` You brought it after all... I'll have to borrow it tomorrow.`
`"Why do you look so glum? Tomorrow we'll be digging out Colonel Randy, right!?"`
`"You're right. ...Ahahaha!`
` I really want to take Colonel Randy home soon~!"`
`Tomitake-san said that "they still haven't found" something in an 'incident.'`
`I thought... that some murder had occurred and there was something waiting to be found... but I guess I was wrong.`
`...To ask, "Was there really a murder here in Hinamizawa?"`
`"...It was quite a disturbing incident.`
` ...They still haven't found it, have they?"`
`If it was just as Tomitake-san said, that undoubtedly pointed to the fact that there had been a murder.`
`...And that there was still "something" to be found.`
