`Rika Furude always thought that there were four members in her family.`
`She could clearly see all of us,`
` her father,`
` her mother,`
` and me.`
`She had no idea that I was invisible to anyone else but her.`
`My appearance is a little different from human beings.`
`I may otherwise look like a person, but I can't hide my horns.`
`So it's obvious that I'm not human.`
`I'd hoped that because Rika has seen me since she was a baby,`
` she wouldn't be bothered by my ugly horns at all.`
`And that hope came true.`
`Just as chicks believe whatever they see first is their parent,`
` Rika accepted me as part of her family as a matter of course.`
`Even though I have these horns.`
`Rika and I have been close ever since the day she accepted me as her family member.`
`I became closer to her than her parents.`
` I couldn't even remember the last time I was able to communicate with someone.`
`We spent all day together.`
`But her family, especially her mother, denied my existence.`
`Since her mother so strongly denied me,`
` Rika and her mother became distant.`
`Rika didn't learn certain things that many children learn from their mothers.`
`That's why I taught her instead.`
`......It's kind of ironic how that made her mother resent Rika even more.`
`Rika used to fight with her mother a lot about how she talked.`
`I guess she picked up some bad habits from me.`
`Besides the fact that she didn't get along with her mother, Rika was a pretty normal girl.`
`She was just like Satoko.`
`She loved running around in the woods, and doing mischievous things.`
`However, in June, 1983...`
`Rika's life was taken.`
`All we want is a happy life for Rika.`
`...My power only allows us to search for the path leading to that.`
`It's awful to repeat the same tragedy over and over again.`
`...Although it's devastating......`
` we can still find happiness within this endless world.`
`Rika Furude's destiny is a tragic dead end.`
`But I'm secretly enjoying the fact that I get to spend more time with her than what normal people can enjoy.`
`It's not just Rika.`
`They may not see or hear me,`
` but being with Satoko, Mion, Rena, and Keiichi is also very fun.`
`I can never be one of them,`
` but...`
` I can still be by their side.`
