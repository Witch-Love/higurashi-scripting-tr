`The day after Watanagashi.`
` Ooishi showed up at our school.`
`It isn't uncommon for Ooishi to show up here today.`
`Interestingly, he always asks to see the most key person in that world.`
`He asks for Keiichi in the world where he gets sick.`
`He asks for Rena in the world where she gets sick.`
`In this world, he asked for me.`
`".........Did Tomitake...`
` really die...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...The way he went was pretty strange, too.`
` Like he was on drugs and hallucinating.`
` He clawed out his own throat until he died."`
`"...I couldn't prevent it."`
`There's nothing I can do now.`
`I knew this was going to happen.`
` I'm sure Takano is dead too...`
`"......And Takano?"`
`"I have bad news about her too.`
` She was found burned to death in the mountains over in Gifu Prefecture.`
` Based on the condition of the body, she was choked to death before her body was burned. `
`It's a tragic story no matter how you look at it."`
`"......I know what you're thinking.`
` You think I know something about what happened to them."`
`"Heavens, no.`
` I only have one question.`
` Who would talk about such a disturbing plan at the festival where anyone could hear...?"`
`"...You think, I'm involved in this murder?"`
`"Well, I wanted to suspect you, but I don't.`
`If you were responsible in some way, you wouldn't have given me the hints you did.`
` At the very least, I'm sure you're not involved with the people who killed them."`
`"......I'm glad you're not suspicious of me."`
`Ooishi threw a ten-yen coin into the offering box, and shook the bell in prayer.`
`"Please let us solve the mystery of Hinamizawa this year!"`
`"......Are you trying to get me involved in your investigation?"`
`"Na ha ha ha...`
` I was just talking to Oyashiro-sama."`
`Ooishi is well aware that people call me the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`...That must have been his attempt at a joke.`
`"...I'd like to see the curse disappear forever too."`
`"Oh, that means we both want the same thing."`
`"......I made a prediction about where you might find Tomitake's body.`
` Didn't you have a police cruiser nearby?"`
`"Yeah, I listened to your prediction, and had a cruiser patrol the area.`
`The place where the concrete and gravel roads meet...`
` It's on the very border of the village.`
` It gets very dark there at night. `
`It always seems like if something bad were to happen, it could happen there."`
`".........So where did you find Tomitake's body?"`
`"We found him dead by the rice fields near Okinomiya."`
`That's not where his body is usually found...`
`If he was fated to hallucinate and die, he would die in exactly the same spot, whether the cruiser was there or not.`
`Just because the cruiser was placed there...`
` Tomitake's body was found in a totally different spot.`
` ...In other words, the existence of the police cruiser disrupted that fate.`
`"Anyway.`
` There's something else I found very interesting.`
` ...I told the officers in the police cruiser to check every vehicle that passed by. `
`As it turns out, one of the cars that headed toward Okinomiya after the festival was over was Takano's."`
`Takano lives in Okinomiya.`
`It wouldn't be strange for her to head back home after the festival.`
`"However, she was the only one inside the car.`
` Tomitake wasn't with her." `
`"......Tomitake always comes to Hinamizawa on his bike."`
`"Then she could've loaded his bike in the trunk and given him a ride.`
` But he was not with her. `
`However, his body was found among the rice fields near Okinomiya, past where the police cruiser was patrolling in Hinamizawa..."`
`"............What are you saying...?"`
`"There's no way he could have biked through the dark woods to avoid the police cruiser.`
` He somehow took the road without being noticed by us.`
` .........Furude-san. `
`Can you tell me what you know about the relationship between Tomitake and Takano?"`
`".........They're dating.`
` ...That's all I know."`
`"I find it hard to believe that Takano would drive back home alone in the dark without her boyfriend.`
` What if she had Tomitake in her trunk, and she was planning to dump his body in the woods... `
`but because the cruiser was in that area, she had no choice but to pass by...`
` and dump him on the side of the road."`
`Both Tomitake and Takano were sent here from Tokyo.`
`I have no idea what their real identities are.`
`I can't say that Takano had no reason to kill Tomitake.`
`However... I've never considered that possibility before in my life...`
`Takano killing Tomitake...?`
` ...But why??`
`I can't think of any reason.`
`Nothing comes to mind,`
` and it's hard to imagine Takano was cornered to the point she had to kill him.`
`...In fact, it was more plausible to think she was enraged when the lovesick Tomitake acted cold towards her, and she strangled his neck.`
`"I never really thought they suited each other.`
` ...Na ha ha, I don't mean to insult Tomitake-kun, but I thought Takano-san was way too smart for him. `
`Have you heard of any rumors that she was trying to use him for anything...?"`
`"...None.`
` But I can ask around.`
` I'll let you know if I find out something."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` I'm just glad that the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama is on my side."`
`But even the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama couldn't solve this mystery for over a hundred years...`
`"But...`
` you said Takano was killed too...`
` How can she be the culprit?"`
`"Well, it's because you leaked me the information, I mean, the prophecy.`
` Without that, I'm sure I would've just believed that both Takano and Tomitake were the victims of the fifth year's curse of Oyashiro-sama. `
`I feel like it's different this time.`
` Maybe as though this is someone trying to make the curse of Oyashiro-sama happen."`
`".........So you really think... that Takano-san is the culprit...?"`
`Basically, this is what Ooishi is trying to say.`
`They're not both victims.`
`The culprit is also pretending to be a victim.`
`This is really hard for me to believe.`
`...I can't think of any reason why Takano would do something like this.`
`Ooishi only feels the way he does because he doesn't know her as well as I do.`
`For another thing, how can he explain that Takano's body was found?`
`Didn't the police in Gifu Prefecture identify the body?`
`"For a charred corpse, the easiest way to identify them is by their dental records.`
` Although, according to the old man in forensics, they're still not 100% sure. `
`...And besides, there's a contradiction with the estimated time of death.`
` It just doesn't make sense."`
`"What do you mean......?"`
`"Well...`
` The test results show that she was dead on the night before the festival.`
` Apparently they inspected the contents of her stomach and such. `
`But at the time of testing, they already had information about Takano.`
` They knew that she was at the festival that night, and realized that the test results didn't match up. `
`So they just dumped the results and decided to take the dental records alone.`
` These things do happen every once in a while...`
` However, if Takano really is the culprit, this body might belong to someone else."`
`"......Is it possible to do something like that?"`
`"When a body is burnt, dental records are the only way to identify it.`
` This might sound too much like a mystery novel, but what if, for example, someone faked Miyo Takano's dental records? `
`If they were skillfully forged, we could have the wrong ID.`
`...Anyway, the Gifu police department has made up their mind that the body belongs to Takano. `
`Within police departments, we sometimes have issues with false test results.`
` That's how most false charges are made.`
` ......It feels to me like this is one of those times."`
`"...So you think Takano is alive?"`
`"Since last night, both Miyo Takano and her car have gone missing.`
` If that body found in Gifu isn't Takano... this is going to be very interesting indeed."`
`"................"`
