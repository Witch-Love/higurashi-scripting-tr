`Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.`
`But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.`
`Therefore, be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.`
`Even God doesn't know when he will descend once more.`
`He is constantly prepared for that day to come.`
`Have faith in your God at all times.`
`Your God doesn't even know when he'll see the light.`
`Do not spare any effort.`
`Study hard every day.`
`Have the passion for discovery.`
`You never know when you will be rewarded, but that day will come for sure.`
`Until then, you must let the fires of your passion burn bright.`
`                                   Hifumi. T`
