`Teppei suspected that Satoko was hiding more money somewhere.`
`But in reality, she had none at all.`
`Teppei had asked her how she survived until now,`
` but she told him that she didn't have to use any money because she was living with her friend.`
`Teppei had made some money off of illegal gambling.`
`While he had some of that money saved up,`
` he had no intention to use it on living expenses.`
`However, there was no way Satoko didn't have the money.`
` Teppei was convinced of that.`
`Teppei's wife, Satoko's aunt, must have taken away the family bankbook when Satoko's parents died in the accident.`
`But her aunt also died last year, and Satoshi is gone too.`
`That means Satoko should have hidden the bankbook somewhere.`
`However, no matter how much he threatened her, she told him that she didn't know anything about it.`
`He continued to question Satoko, still believing that she was hiding it somewhere.`
`He couldn't beat her, because her teacher and the child consultation center would suspect him.`
`So he wouldn't beat her.`
`Instead, he spoke to her in a loud and violent voice, and broke furniture in front of her.`
`Threatening people like that is Teppei's forte.`
`However, Satoko continued to claim that she had no clue about the bankbook. She didn't seem to be lying.`
`After destroying the whole living room, leaving Satoko frightened like a scared little animal, Teppei finally believed that Satoko had no idea where the bankbook was.`
`...In that case, where could it be?`
` Teppei had two ideas.`
`One idea was that his wife hid it somewhere in secret.`
`The other idea was that Satoshi took it after his wife's death, and hid it somewhere else.`
`Either way, he was certain that it was hidden somewhere in this house.`
`He told Satoko to clean up the mess he made in the living room, and started searching around the house.`
`...Teppei was starting to get bored with Satoko.`
`He'd heard that Satoko's parents had a lot of money saved up.`
`But his wife had taken control of that money herself.`
`Since his wife had been quite thrifty, he was sure that she left the bankbook somewhere without using it.`
`Once he got his hands on that money, he could move somewhere else entirely.`
`Teppei was still acquainted with a few people from the gambling spot in Gogura.`
`People he used to help out are still hanging around that area.`
`They still owe him.`
` They should at least let him crash there.`
`It was great that Satoko takes care of all the chores around the house, but Teppei felt uncomfortable about being watched by both the school and the consultation center.`
`Teppei, all too aware that he's a man of violence, couldn't stand living with Satoko without being violent towards her.`
`The more he suffered, the stronger his urge to beat up Satoko grew.`
`Since Teppei only knew joy through forcing others who resisted to submit,`
` testing to see how violent he could be before the helpless Satoko resisted him was something he was excited to try eventually.`
`Still upset over the visitation by the school teacher,`
` Teppei promised himself that he would destroy Satoko's life before leaving the village...`
