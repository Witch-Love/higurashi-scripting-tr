`The son of God promised that he would be resurrected within three days.`
`Sinful men guarded his grave to make sure he would not wake up, but that was foolish of them.`
`He meant that his spirit and his lessons would be resurrected, not his physical shell.`
`Do not be afraid of physical death.`
`If you achieve great things, you will live again.`
`You will surpass death, and become immortal.`
`A demon took the son of God to a cliff, and told him to jump off.`
`He claimed that if he was really a son of God, a miracle would help him survive.`
`He tried to challenge the Lord.`
`The Lord challenges humans, but humans may not challenge the Lord.`
`To challenge is to suspect.`
`Suspicion will speak words of evil into your ears, and it will make you falter.`
`Do not doubt your own achievements.`
`Do not doubt your own life.`
`Do not doubt your contributions.`
`Do not let others criticize your achievements.`
`That is the same as doubting your own life.`
