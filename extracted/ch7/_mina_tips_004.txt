`"......Are you sure Houjou isn't suspicious of you?"`
`"Don't worry.`

`The man looked out of the window and saw three black cars screeching to a halt by the apartment building.`
`Several intimidating men emerged from those cars.`
`Some of them even looked up toward the window.`
`He quickly hid himself behind the curtain.`
`"Shit! They're here!!`
` Run!!"`
`"Are you serious?!`
` But why?!"`
