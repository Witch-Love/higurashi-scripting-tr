`...What are you doing?`
`I don't see you playing by yourself that often.`
`All you could do before was to nod to my questions...`
` Since when do you have your own will?`
`...I'm glad.`
`I finally have a sister or a brother.`
` Whichever you are.`
`I used to be an existence of nothingness, just like you.`
`But one day, I began to have my own identity,`
` my own thoughts,`
` and eventually, my own body.`
`So it's not a surprise to see you in possession of your own will.`
`Welcome to this vast yet tiny world,`
` my sister.`
` You might be my brother, but let me call you my sister until I know for sure.`
`This is an endless, eternal, and infinite world.`
`But that doesn't mean it's boundlessly vast.`
`I suppose...`
` you could describe it like a ring with a small diameter.`
`While the ring is an eternal, endlessly looping world...`
`that doesn't mean it contains infinite space.`
`Yes, in short, this world is eternally sealed.`
`The future is supposed to be an infinite weave of countless choices...`
` ...yet for whatever reason, our world always ends in death.`
`If I were to compare it to something, perhaps a 'maze of fate' would be appropriate.`
`Looping through the same moments forever... steadily grows harder and more dejecting, eventually producing something like me.`
`...Then as that draws further on, even one like you is born, and eventually this world may be filled with your sisters too.`
`After that, we'll build a colony inside of it,`
` and once we lose our interest in this maze, "Rika Furude" will disappear from this world.`
`...It looks like you still cling to this narrow world, Rika.`
` Though I lost interest long ago.`
`Which is why I'm truly glad you were born for me to talk to.`
`So what are you doing?`
`Are you collecting Fragments of memory?`
`There's only five or six of them right now.`
`It must still be fun for you, though.`
`There used to be more Fragments long ago, `
`but one by one they disappeared into the darkness.`
`Now, these are the only ones that remain clear.`
`Oh, that's not how you're supposed to use it.`
`See?`
` Try and hold it up to the light...`
`All of that`
` is the life of Rika Furude,`
` and its end.`
`That one is...`
` Oh...`
` I remember that one...`
`That's the world when Keiichi was cursed.`
`Those Fragments are like books to me, so I titled that one the "Onikakushi" chapter.`
`Do you remember what happened in that one?`
`Good...`
` That makes things easier.`
`In Onikakushi, Keiichi Maebara was consumed by the darkness.`
`He couldn't accept the kind words his friends offered him, and eventually beat them to death, not knowing of their kindness.`
`We were all killed after that anyway.`
`That had nothing to do with his story, though.`
`That Fragment is the "Watanagashi" chapter.`
`Shion Sonozaki was cursed in that one.`
`She killed many people out of revenge for her boyfriend's disappearance, as he went missing in 1982.`
`Rika worked so hard.`
`But she was captured at the end, and she was tortured to death.`
`That's why she chose to commit suicide in the "Meakashi" chapter, because things were going to turn out the same way...`
`That Fragment over there is called the "Tatarigoroshi" chapter.`
`Satoko's uncle came back and locked her up inside her house.`
`That was the worst world of all.`
`There was nothing Rika was able to do in that world.`
`Whenever Satoko's uncle comes back, Rika usually just gives up on that world.`
`Fortunately, Satoko's uncle doesn't come back that frequently.`
`That one is called the "Tsumihoroboshi" chapter.`
`Rika was there until just a moment ago.`
`Rena Ryuugu was possessed in that world.`
`It was pretty exciting to see her take over the whole school.`
`It surprised me to learn that Keiichi Maebara had a memory of the other worlds, just like we do.`
`It was pretty amazing, but then again most of us have some kind of memory like that.`
`We all have an imaginary world within us--some idea of what would've happened`
` if you did things differently.`
`It's like the strange feeling you get when you do something for the first time, but it feels like you've done it before.`
`Everyone has a memory of an imaginary world in their mind, but the memory is not always that clear.`
`It's not surprising, really.`
`You are special enough to be able to see those Fragments of memory.`
`It's probably very difficult for you`
` to understand how special you really are.`
`You were born into a world where it's a natural thing for you to see these Fragments.`
`I was originally born in the normal world.`
`I didn't know until recently that I could collect these Fragments of memory.`
`You grabbed those Fragments just because you could, but I didn't know how to do that for a long time.`
`...I'm sorry.`
`I'm sure you're not interested in hearing my story.`
`Huh?`
` What's wrong?`
` What are you curious about?`
`Oh...?`
` You're curious as to why so many different incidents occur in the same world?`
`Hee hee...`
` ...It's very interesting, isn't it?`
`Why do you think that's the case?`
`Let's think about it together.`
`Thinking is the first step towards playing a game.`
`The main character among Rika's group of friends...`
` is Keiichi Maebara.`
`In Onikakushi, he was possessed by suspicion and killed Rena Ryuugu and Mion Sonozaki.`
`If that was an inevitable event, he would be killing them in every world.`
`In other words, what Keiichi Maebara did in Onikakushi was not inevitable.`
`Indeed...`
`...`
` The only thing that's inevitable...`
`is Keiichi Maebara's role.`
`If Keiichi Maebara was someone with a naturally-suspicious heart,`
` he would take the same actions in every world.`
`But that didn't happen.`
`It's true that Keiichi Maebara is both passionate and easily convinced of anything,`
`but it's rare for him to exhibit the kind of rage he displayed in Onikakushi.`
`In other words, even though something might seem inevitable in one world, that may not be the case if you compare it to a different one.`
`If something really is inevitable, it will happen for sure in every life.`
`That's what true inevitability is like.`
`It's very important that you know that.`
`When you compare the different worlds, what's common among all of them is the truth.`
`Understand?`
`Like I said, what seems inevitable in one life could just be a random event in another.`
`The club activities that Mion Sonozaki suggests are a good example.`
`If Mion Sonozaki had a strong inclination toward playing certain games, you would be playing them in every world.`
`But in reality, you participate in different activities in most of them.`
`That means that the games they play in the club are randomly decided by Mion Sonozaki.`
`We know that now because we've been through many different lives.`
`Those who only live in one world can't see if the event in question is inevitable or random.`
`Those who only live once can't predict what's going on in Mion Sonozaki's mind... but we can.`
`Although the activities are random, Mion Sonozaki calls us together for the club meeting almost every day in every life.`
`I can see that Mion Sonozaki holds a strong will towards having the club meeting.`
`Mion Sonozaki always wants to play with the other club members,`
` but she doesn't know what to play.`
`See?`
`We can read Mion Sonozaki's mind just by simply examining these Fragments.`
`With this alone, we can see part of who Mion Sonozaki really is.`
`Let me talk a bit more about Keiichi Maebara.`
`For those who only live once, the world of the Onikakushi chapter is nothing but a story where Keiichi suffered mysterious hallucinations and beat his friends to death.`
`For them, there's nothing beyond that fact.`
`We, however, can compare different Fragments and find out something they could never see.`
`As a result, we know that the murder of his friends was not inevitable.`
`I told you that just earlier.`
`In fact, while there are about five or six pieces in front of you, he only kills his friends in one of them.`
`That means we can roughly conclude`
` that the possibility Keiichi Maebara triggers the tragedy is less than 20%, and is almost a fluke.`
`This means that amongst the countless worlds, Keiichi Maebara causing the tragedy is an unimportant factor.`
`Now, can you find the common thread to be drawn from here...?`
`My, you've found it already?`
`No wonder you were born in this world.`
`You're quick to learn the knack for playing with building blocks.`
`I didn't figure that out for a while.`
`...I was born in the normal world, so I could only see things from a single world's perspective.`
`...I was too obsessed with the fact that "Keiichi Maebara" caused the tragedy, so I had trouble finding it.`
`Right!`
` That's exactly right!`
`You see it?`
`The Onikakushi,`
` Watanagashi,`
` Meakashi,`
` and Tsumihoroboshi chapters`
` all have something in common.`
`Someone in the group becomes violent because of dark and paranoid thoughts.`
`In each world,`
`either Keiichi Maebara,`
`Shion Sonozaki,`
`or Rena Ryuugu became violent as their delusions grew stronger.`
`Keiichi Maebara, Shion Sonozaki, and Rena Ryuugu are all my close friends, but they were all born and raised differently.`
`The only common factor is that they all live in Hinamizawa.`
`I just said it not too long ago, though.`
`When we peer through these Fragments of multiple worlds,`
`the constant phenomena become our facts, and the chance phenomena hold little meaning.`
`In other words, the unrelated, individual "culprits" are not all that important.`
`To go further, the "violence" of their crimes also bears no meaning.`
`Keiichi Maebara beat his friends to death,`
`Shion Sonozaki killed the central people of the Three Families,`
` and Rena Ryuugu took over the school.`
`They were all different.`
` There's nothing in common there.`
`In fact, the very, very important truth is that while the culprit and crimes are decided at random,`
` their "process" of growing paranoid until they resort to violence is always constant.`
`The suspect changes every time,`
` but the process does not.`
`After comparing the different worlds, this is the truth I found.`
`This is one truth that is common to all the worlds of Hinamizawa.`
`The rule is that a random person becomes violent under the influence of paranoid thoughts. This is Rule X.`
`Keiichi Maebara,`
` Shion Sonozaki,`
` and Rena Ryuugu--`
` --pieces with no particular connection, have the potential to succumb to that rule with random probability.`
`I don't know what the probability is that those pieces will be ensnared by that rule.`
`Perhaps there is some rule to that too.`
`Is it because these three are all close in age?`
` Or is it because they all live in Hinamizawa?`
`...Well, we're not detectives or police officers.`
` This is not something that a small girl like us, "Rika Furude", can easily figure out.`
`At least we now know that there's a mysterious rule in the world of Hinamizawa.`
`People who only live in one world have no way of knowing that.`
`I'm proud of myself for figuring that out...`
`I guess for you it's not particularly surprising, though.`
`Huh?`
` What did you say?`
`That's right.`
` If something is common among all worlds, that means it's fated to happen.`
`Hee hee hee...`
` Some events quickly come to mind, don't they...?`
`...Right. Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano are always killed in those worlds.`
`On top of that, they are murdered in exactly the same way in every world.`
`...In other words, unlike our previous rule with its variability, their murders are thoroughly planned out by someone with a strong will.`
`So that does not fit with the mysterious, vague Rule X that leads a random individual to violence.`
`After all, they are always murdered, regardless of who falls to Rule X.`
`Therefore, there's another rule to these worlds, a Rule that says Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano will get killed on the night of Watanagashi. Let's call it Rule Y.`
`Hee hee...`
` Don't you see how funny this is?`
`Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano are killed in every world, right?`
`Every time, the character who gets cursed always thinks that their deaths have something to do with the danger that's awaiting them.`
`The fact that someone turns violent, Rule X,`
` and Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano's deaths, Rule Y, are supposed to be two independent rules,`
` but they all tend to link them together.`
`Of course, one could say that's how they become ensnared in the spell of paranoia leading them to violence to begin with...`
`But do you think, in their paranoia, that they notice someone is trying to lead them to link those rules together?`
`Yes.`
` Whoever the piece leading them is, they are the one making this stage called Hinamizawa very complicated.`
`You should have noticed at least two suspicious people.`
` Do you know who I'm talking about?`
`That's right.`
`I'm referring to Kuraudo Ooishi and Miyo Takano.`
`When you compare our previous Fragments, the role of the piece known as Kuraudo Ooishi becomes clear.`
`He's a detective who is retiring this year, and he's in a hurry to solve the mystery of the series of deaths in Hinamizawa.`
`After he retires, he'll have to move away from the village.`
`That's why he's desperate to solve this case before he has to leave Hinamizawa.`
`Why is he so obsessed with the serial murders in Hinamizawa?`
`That's right.`
` It's because of the first murder involving the manager of the construction site.`
`The victim was Ooishi's close friend.`
`You will see that if you look at the "Himatsubushi" chapter.`
`Ooishi was there when the dam conflict was at its peak.`
`He saw how the Sonozaki family took control of the Onigafuchi Guardians, and he believed that the Sonozaki family was pulling the strings behind the whole incident.`
`That's why he always suspected that the Sonozaki family was behind the series of mysterious deaths, regardless of the evidence or lack thereof.`
`His personal, biased belief, combined with his credibility as a police detective, affected the pitiable victims of persecution complexes in each world.`
`As a result, the pitiful victims of Rule X come to accept the Sonozaki family as the identity of the unknown force their paranoia seeks.`
`...Shion Sonozaki's case was the most conspicuous one in that matter.`
`So yes, if this piece, Ooishi, didn't intervene, then perhaps the victims of Rule X wouldn't have resorted to such violence.`
`So the role his piece plays is to indirectly cause the tragedy.`
`I don't know who named him this,`
` but "Oyashiro-sama's servant" is the perfect nickname for Ooishi.`
`The other suspicious person is Miyo Takano.`
`One would assume the only role of her piece is to amuse herself with research into Onigafuchi's dreadful history, and to take pleasure in scaring others with those tales.`
`However, just like Ooishi, she also gives them the idea that the Sonozaki family is behind all the mysterious incidents that happen in the village.`
`She interfered the most with Rena Ryuugu.`
`For Miyo Takano, Rena Ryuugu was the perfect prey, grasping at straws to try and identify the force she suspected.`
`Ironically, however, Miyo Takano always ends up getting killed at the end.`
`If she had survived and seen Rena take over the school, she would've laughed long and loud.`
`Now, have you realized that these two pieces and the roles they fulfill have their own rule too?`
`They talk about the Sonozaki family, and the listeners always believe them.`
`This is Rule Z, and what a humorous rule it is.`
`You should already have an answer to this mystery in your Fragments on hand.`
`The fact is that the Sonozaki family always acts as if they are responsible, no matter if they are or not.`
`They always pretend to be the villains in order to make sure that people continue to fear them.`
`As a result, the villagers have believed that the Sonozaki family has been pulling the strings ever since the dam conflict ended.`
`Kuraudo Ooishi and Miyo Takano were simply fooled by that rule.`
`Actually, the whole village is fooled by it.`
`Still, the more I think about it...`
`The stranger the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa seems to me.`
`Hee hee hee...`
` Do you know why?`
`Nearly all of the Fragments of memories we have here are from 1983,`
` so I have no idea about the incidents from 1980-1982.`
`But it's likely that interpreting these murders as "serial"`
` is simply a result of falling victim to Rule Z, believing that the Sonozaki family is pulling the strings behind everything.`
`In short, they may be trying to conflate those multiple crimes, which each happened for different reasons, into one big case.`
`Well, I have no way of discerning the truth from the Fragments here.`
`Still, perhaps something lies in one of them.`
`Each case was supposed to have been solved individually, after all.`
`We don't know if that theory is sound or irrational, but it might surprisingly be an element we can't ignore.`
`That reminds me, Shion said something intriguing in the "Meakashi" chapter.`
`That "curse system" she came up with.`
` Do you remember that?`
`Her theory was that the villagers believe that they are allowed to kill an "enemy" of the village on the night of Watanagashi, in the name of Oyashiro-sama's curse. `
`And that this foundation of "murder is allowed on that night alone" is the true identity of the curse.`
`Since most of the Fragments here are from 1983, there's nothing to back the validity of Shion's theory, but there are still interesting things about it.`
`In other words, her theory is that the suspect is not the one who's committing the crime.`
` It's the environment that's causing the murder.`
`People in a single world tend to analyze a criminal's life to determine the process that led them to crime, but her idea is different.`
`The real crime is committed not by the criminals, but by the environment.`
`In other words, it may only be happenstance that Robber A committed the crime,`
` and the environment of poverty may have created Robber B instead,`
` or perhaps even Robber C.`
`A may not even be a criminal in another world.`
`Therefore, the real criminal is not A, but the environment that creates A, B, or C.`
`And well, while people in a single world may be able to reach such an idea,`
` the widespread desire to place blame commonly causes A to be lynched by society while the environment that gave rise to A goes ignored.`
`Did I confuse you...?`
`I'm sorry.`
`Perhaps that example was actually harder to understand for you.`
`It's easy for me to see it like that because I'm from the normal world.`
`Let me make it simple for you.`
` The culprit behind the tragedy in many worlds isn't "individuals" like Keiichi Maebara or Shion Sonozaki, but the "environment".`
` So "Rule X" is the true culprit at fault.`
`You're earning good marks if you can grasp that, even if we don't know the identity of "Rule X".`
`And if you can grasp the three rules governing this stage called Hinamizawa--Rules X, Y, and Z--`
`then you're earning very good marks.`
`So long as you understand those rules, then even if this is your first-experienced world, you should easily find the truth without distraction.`
`See?`
` Isn't it fun?`
`Merely three simple rules are interacting on this stage, creating a kaleidoscope of different worlds.`
`This is probably a very unusual case.`
`In other locations, you shouldn't be able to see such extreme variation even after looping through several worlds.`
`It keeps me entertained just staying here and watching these worlds revolve.`
`Anyway...`
` There's one more fact we can understand from these Fragments of worlds.`
`This is the biggest problem we Rika Furudes are facing.`
`The fact that Rika Furude always dies each time.`
`It's as if June 1983 is a dead end for her.`
`Worse, there's no randomness to it; it's guaranteed to happen.`
`In other words, it's the same pattern as the deaths of Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano.`
` It's following the exact same rule, Rule Y.`
`Tomitake Jirou and Takano Miyo are always murdered on the night of Watanagashi.`
`Furude Rika's date of death is not always the same, but she's always dead by the middle of June.`
`Jirou Tomitake and Miyo Takano are probably attacked on their way home, so that's why it always happens on the same night.`
`But for Rika Furude, it's different.`
`She takes different actions in every world, and her lifestyle is very unpredictable.`
`For that reason, the day of her death is not always the same.`
`However, she always dies in June,`
` because a similar powerful conviction vows to kill her too.`
`So can we assume that the same Rule Y killing them is also the rule behind her death?`
`Is the same person killing all three of them?`
`I don't know if it's the same person, but it's highly likely the same rule is at work.`
`Is it the same person,`
` or the same organization?`
`Is it the same views?`
` The same goals?`
`Rika's most important goal is to escape her deadly fate.`
`But it doesn't mean that she just wants to leave the village and survive.`
`She wants to live happily in the village.`
`All of her friends must also be happy too.`
`That's Rika's happy future.`
` The ideal future she hopes for.`
`...It's tragic that we can't realize such a simple desire no matter how many times we repeat this.`
`Though, it's a tragedy we're only able to perceive, because we're beings capable of comparing the Fragments from different worlds.`
`By the way, I have some interesting information.`
`While Rika is almost always killed by Rule Y,`
`have you noticed that she's killed by Rule X in some worlds?`
`Right.`
` It happened in the Watanagashi and the Meakashi chapters.`
`Rika Furude committed suicide, but you can say she was more or less killed by Rule X via Shion Sonozaki in those worlds.`
`In other words,`
` this is a blunder for Rule Y.`
`Rule Y is trying to kill Rika with a strong desire to achieve some aim.`
`But she was killed before that, as a result of the unrelated Rule X.`
`That might have caused them to show some "disturbance".`
`If Rule Y's objective is simply to bury Rika, then that's not a problem,`
`but if they have some objective beyond that, then...`
` ...that might show up as some other phenomenon.`
`Perhaps the Watanagashi and Meakashi chapters have something in common,`
` something that doesn't happen in the other worlds.`
`Unfortunately, we're Rika Furude, so we don't know what happens after Rika is dead.`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...Or,`
` by any chance...`
`Do you know what happened?`
`Since I'm Rika Furude, I only know of events during Rika's life.`
`You, on the other hand, are a special existence who was born in a superior world.`
`Is there anything that didn't happen in the Watanagashi and Meakashi chapters...`
`that happened in all the other worlds after Rika's death?`
`If you know anything,`
` then that must be...`
` another truth behind Rule Y.`
`The memories I have here are all mainly about the chaos brought about by Rika's friends, that is, Rule X...`
`...but its foundation, Rule Z,`
` and the obvious hostility common among all worlds, Rule Y,`
` are what I believe to be the true rules governing this stage.`
`If so, then Rika's path is a thorny one.`
`She needs to fight Rule Y in order to survive.`
`Unless she defeats it, she has no future past June 1983.`
`And to win her own happiness, she must also beat Rule X to win her friends' safety.`
`So long as that's undefeated, one of Rika's precious friends may be led to tragedy.`
`If that happens, then even should Rika survive, she wouldn't have the happy future she hopes for.`
`She also may have to defeat Rule Z, just as Sonozaki Shion faced it in Meakashi.`
`So long as Rule Z remains, then even if she escapes 1983, it's possible another tragedy may lie waiting in 1984.`
`...It's extremely likely that Rule Z is the breeding ground for Rule X.`
`Hinamizawa's fundamental belief that the Sonozaki family is behind everything,`
` and the custom that anything can be misconstrued as the curse, may indirectly be the root of all evil here.`
`People are not surprised to see somebody die on the night of Watanagashi.`
`That type of thinking is keeping the curse alive in Hinamizawa, where it causes even more tragedy. It's Rule Z reinforcing itself.`
`Rules X,`
` Y,`
` and Z.`
`There are three rules that hunt Rika down in the eternal June of 1983.`
`They are all tough obstacles.`
`We didn't even figure out these three common rules until recently.`
`Were you aware of them?`
`If you were, I'll give you straight A's.`
`I've tried so hard in the past to break these rules, but I was never successful.`
`However, a miracle happened in the Tsumihoroboshi chapter.`
`Keiichi Maebara was able to recognize a small Fragment from another world by chance, and he beat Rule X.`
`...In the end, Rika was still killed that night by Rule Y, though.`
`But still, one rule was defeated.`
`That was a huge leap forward.`
`Rika knew there were three common rules among the worlds, but she could never break any of them.`
`Eventually she gave up, and lost interest in the worlds.`
`That's how I was born...`
`However, she's different now.`
`She learned something valuable from Keiichi Maebara.`
`That the rules can be broken with a strong enough will to fight.`
`If she can break all three rules,`
` Rika Furude will be freed from her eternal prison...`
`She doesn't have much time left, though.`
`Rika has traveled through many worlds.`
`Her physical life span is not a problem, but her mental life span is getting shorter.`
`Mentally, she is extremely old,`
` and her soul is starting to turn into something different.`
`In the end, she'll probably lose the ability to experience singular worlds.`
`She's already showing those signs, and eventually her memories from the parallel worlds will mix together,`
` ultimately causing her derangement,`
` and the loss of Rika Furude's soul.`
`Then she will disappear.`
`That means that you and I are going to be left in this dark world.`
`The Fragments of our memories will gradually disappear,`
` and we will be left alone in the eternal darkness. Eventually, we will die...`
`Rika Furude is aware of that.`
`She knows that her mental life span is getting shorter and shorter.`
`Hanyuu is also losing her powers.`
`She can't rewind through years of time like she used to.`
`Her power has decreased so much that she can barely rewind one month of time.`
`Actually, she can only rewind a few weeks...`
`In the next world, she should only have about two weeks of time.`
`Rika Furude is going to try and break all three rules`
` in just those two weeks.`
