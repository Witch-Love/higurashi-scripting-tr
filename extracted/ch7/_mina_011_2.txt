`Satoko was bearing the abuse... but even something small would be enough to break her.`
`Just like an old bowl that has a crack in it...`
` One day that crack will eventually widen, and the bowl will shatter...`
`"In my imaginary world... Satoko broke... when I rubbed her head.`
` ......She thought my hand was her uncle's hand. `
`She pushed me away ...and hid behind the curtain... and cried out for her brother, saying 'Nii-nii, Nii-nii!'"`
`"......Who told you that she called her brother 'Nii-nii'?"`
`"Huh?`
` I don't know.`
` I guess someone did...`
` That's what she calls Satoshi, right?`
` ......Anyway, it was devastating to hear her cry like that.`
` ...I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't even get close. `
`...She cried more as I walked closer to her ...because she thought I was her uncle."`
`"......You're amazing... Keiichi-kun.`
` ...I can't believe that was only your imagination.`
` ......That's exactly how Satoko-chan was last year. `
`I remember it clearly,`
` but it's impressive how you can imagine it... since you've only been here for a few months. `
`You really are amazing.`
` So that explains why you feel the same urgency we do."`
`"So, you feel the same way I do...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I can't imagine it as clearly as you have...`
` ...But I think Satoko-chan will break in few days if we don't do anything about this.`
` ...I think she will hide behind the curtain and scream for her Nii-nii. `
`......That's when we'll finally realize something.`
` It's not a crime to be powerless.`
` It's a crime to do nothing.`
` ......Huh...?`
` It's only in my imagination, but... `
`...I'm crying, as though it's happening right in front of me..."`
`...Rena can also sense how urgently we need to save Satoko.`
`...Not everybody feels that way, though.`
`My friends all do, but they're special...`
` ...and normal people like those at the child consultation center see us as overreacting...`
`"They have a point, though...`
` We don't really have anything to say back to them if they're going to claim it's only been one day.`
` It's just like getting a cold. `
`Doctors always say, 'let's see what happens for a couple of days'."`
`"Rena...`
` I think we should trust our instincts.`
` We have no time to spare.`
` We have to save Satoko now."`
`"Yes.`
` Even if I can't come up with a good idea on our own, together we can accomplish anything!`
` When I was down and depressed before, someone told me the same thing. `
`I think now is the time to come together and show people what we can do."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I don't know who told you that, but that's exactly how I feel."`
`It was strange.`
` I've had this feeling ever since Rena told me this story at school.`
`...It felt like I, too, once learned a lesson after some event.`
`......But Rena and I only met recently.`
` I guess it's just a coincidence.`
`......Anyway... I was so lonely inside of my imagination.`
`I thought it was stupid for them to only sit and think about how they could save Satoko, and I made a selfish decision...`
`But I eventually learned...`
` Just like Rena did.`
`You'll never come up with anything good by worrying about something on your own.`
`You have to talk to your friends.`
` That way, they will help you reach the best possible solution.`
`"You said something when you stood in Shii-chan's way today.`
` You told her to trust you. You said you didn't have any idea yet, but that you would find one soon.`
` ...I'm going to trust you. `
`I believe that you will come up with the best solution."`
`"Ahahaha, don't just rely on me.`
` You can give me ideas if you have any."`
`"Hau, that's not what I meant.`
` ...I have faith in my friends at all times.`
` I'm going to trust us.`
` I know that we can save Satoko-chan.`
` But we're not going to use a shortcut."`
`"......That's right.`
` We will save her from this mess.`
` Keep on believing.`
` I believe in us too."`
`I will never think that I'm the only one who's trying to save her.`
`I believe that all of us feel the same way.`
`"Let's have a meeting tomorrow.`
` Chie-sensei might have new information too.`
` ...We may not be able to come up with a good idea right away, but she might have something."`
`"Yeah.`
` You're right.`
` I know that there's always another option."`
`"That's right.`
` We're not going to give up.`
` There is a better way.`
` I'm sure there is.`
` We may not find it right away, but we'll never give up!"`
`"No.`
` Never."`
`...Mion praised her for it too, but Rena really is strong in a crisis.`
`I got a little emotional when I was talking with Mion, but Rena is different.`
`Her fire is quiet and blue, so at first glance it seems lesser than my bright red, roaring blaze, but... the truth is the opposite.`
` Blue flames burn far hotter.`
`As I spoke with Rena, I felt my useless, wild energy calming down so I could rationally search for the best solution.`
`...Through that, I felt Rena's strength.`
`Though, apparently Rena felt similarly about me.`
`"When I'm talking with you, I feel like I can accomplish anything.`
` You're so strong and reliable.`
` I feel more courageous when I talk with you.`
` I feel more confident that we can save Satoko-chan."`
`"I get calmness from you...`
` and you get confidence from me...`
` We balance each other out like that, huh?`
` We're a good combination!"`
`"Mii-chan has a lot of power as a member of the Sonozaki family, but she has a very frail heart.`
` But I believe that you and I can support her."`
`"That's right.`
` We have nothing to be scared of!"`
`"Yeah, I agree!"`
`Talking to Rena made me feel very confident.`
`...If I can share that confidence with my friends,`
` I'll never feel down and miserable ever again.`
`I'm going to give my power to the other club members, so we can fight even harder...!`
`"Rika-chan is really depressed right now...... She lost her will to fight.`
` But I'm sure she'll get that will back once she sees us working hard."`
`"You're right. Once she gets her willpower back, nothing can stop us!!`
` I'll see you tomorrow.`
` Let's talk about our plan, and involve the principal too.`
` We should get advice from as many people as we can. `
`Let's find the best possible solution!`
` That's the best thing we can do right now!"`
`"Yeah!"`
`I got off the phone with Rena. That was a pretty passionate conversation we were having.`
`......It's unfortunate that the child consultation center came to the conclusion they did,`
` but if they could still decide to wait and see, then that proved that Satoko was still safe for now.`
`We are no more than children.`
` ...Worrying about it too much won't cause us to come up with any good ideas.`
`Murder isn't a real solution...`
`......But I had to admit.`
` I thought about it once.`
`It's easy to burn up in rage.`
`......However, I'd have to stay calm, like Rena.`
`She was still burning up.`
`Burning up very calmly, with a blue and quiet flame.`
`I'd never seen anything like that before...`
`"Keiichi, go take a bath already!`
` Hurry up!"`
`I heard my mom speaking to me.`
`"You can go ahead of me, Mom!"`
`I needed more time to think about what to do with Satoko.`
`...Everyone else was probably doing the same.`
`"You should go first!`
` There's bath salt from real hot springs in there. It feels really good on your skin."`
`"......I don't think there's bath salt in real hot springs."`
`"Ha ha ha ha!`
` Mmmmm! Milk tastes so good after a bath!"`
`My dad seemed to be in a good mood. He probably finished his work.`
`......He's as scary as a bear when he has artist's block.`
`......Ah, maybe...`
` Maybe my parents could help with an idea.`
`They're the closest adults to me, after all.`
` ......Should I talk to them?`
`Stupid question.`
`I had no reason not to.`
`I'd have to talk to them and seek some advice.`
`"Dad... I have something I want to talk to you about."`
`"Huh?`
` What's this, is it about the auction at the coming festival?`
` You have my full support!`
` Speaking of which, when is the next festival committee meeting?`
` They called me to participate too. `
`I'll have to mark my calendar."`
`"Oh, it's not about that.`
` My classmate is in trouble..."`
`As I talked about Satoko, my mom joined us and listened as well.`
`My dad is a strange artist, but my mom is a normal person with common sense.`
` She might be able to help.`
`"......I just got a call and found out that they put her case on hold.`
` We're wondering what we should do now..."`
`"They already called the child consultation center, so you should let them take care of it."`
`"But she was being abused last year too, right?`
` I don't know how bad it was, but I think it's wrong for him to force her to move out of her friend's place."`
`"He was neglecting her for a year, after all..."`
`"We can't just wait and see what happens just because the consultation center said to.`
` ......We're her friends, so we want to be more aggressive about saving her.`
` But we have no idea how we can do that."`
`"Keiichi... don't even think about attacking him."`
`"I'm not...`
` I wouldn't talk to you guys if that was on my mind."`
`"That's true.`
` I thought you might ask us how to commit a perfect crime."`
`Hey...`
` I would never ask my parents something like that...`
` I think.`
`"Keiichi, you're right.`
` There are many battles in this world, but it's always important that you follow the rules.`
` People won't help you if you're going to break them, and they won't respect you either. `
`You have to fight according to the rules."`
`"Are there even rules for battles...?`
` Well, anyway...`
` Do you have any ideas?"`
`My parents have been alive for more than twice as long as me.`
`They must have had some experience with things like this.`
`...They must have many good ideas.`
`At least that's what I thought...`
` But they crossed their arms and went silent...`
`"......Calling the child consultation center is the first thing you should do.`
` But what do you do if that doesn't work...?"`
`"......Do you think...`
` we can even rely on the law?`
` Do you think the police won't do anything until Satoko is seriously injured...?"`
`"I think you have to make an appeal."`
`"Appeal?`
` What, you mean, sue him?!"`
`"That's not it.`
` The child consultation center is supposed to take care of the child abuse cases.`
` But if you're unsatisfied with the decision they make..."`
`"...Make an appeal to the court?"`
`"Keiichi.`
` You go to court when you can't resolve an issue with the person you're dealing with.`
` It's the final place you go to."`
`"You want the child consultation center to protect Satoko-chan, right?`
` But they made a decision that you disagree with..."`
`"And...?"`
`"We need to make an appeal to the child consultation center!"`
`If we're unsatisfied with the decision they made, we can simply go and tell them that.`
`"We need to go there and explain to them how serious this case is."`
`"Yeah, that sounds good.`
` They have no idea what situation Satoko-chan is in right now.`
` Since they're misunderstanding what's going on, we have to go there and make it clear."`
`"I see... That's the best approach..."`
`"......I don't know about that...`
` I've heard that they never change their decisions, once made.`
` It might be just a waste of time..."`
`"We don't know that until we try.`
` Giving up before even trying is what losers do!`
` We have to try everything we can.`
` Remember what the principal said?`
` We'll fail if we give up before even trying. `
`Shion, your fire is blazing bright red, ready to do whatever it takes, even if that's acting hasty, to save Satoko.`
` ...But truly hot fire is blue and calm.`
` Don't give up. We should do everything we can! `
`What do you think, Chie-sensei?`
` Am I wrong?"`
`"No......`
` You're not saying anything wrong.`
` You've calmed down a lot.`
`I was concerned for you because I thought you might come up with an idea to attack him in the dark."`
`That's what my mom was saying...`
` Is that how people perceive me?`
`"I thought we should wait and see what happens.`
`...But after hearing everything all of you have said, and thinking about what happened last year, I now understand that this is an emergency situation. `
`People can change their minds if you're persuasive enough.`
` The child consultation center might change their mind too.`
` They might reverse their decision if you succeed in making an appeal."`
`"What do you think?`
` Shii-chan?`
` You should fight with us, rather than thinking about it alone."`
`"I'm not feeling lonely!`
` I'm not sad because I'm all alone!"`
`"...You do sound awfully sad, actually.`
` Maybe you do want to join us?"`
`"Whatever!`
` Fine then!`
` Let's just go to the child consultation center!`
` I'm going to punch them in their faces if they don't do something!"`
`"That's not a good idea, but I feel your passion now!`
` I guess you calmed down after getting some sleep."`
`"I-I'm just serious about this, is all."`
`"Heh heh heh.`
` Anyway, let's go and make it happen.`
` I know where the child consultation center is.`
`This ol' man didn't know until recently, but it's on the first floor of the library."`
`Mion grinned and showed us the location on a city guidebook.`
` ...She's really prepared for this!`
`"The office is open until a quarter past five.`
` Don't try and pick a fight with them.`
` We have to stay calm!"`
`"What?`
` Are you talking to me, Sis?`
` Who do you think I am?`
` I'll cry if I have to. Our goal is to make them change their mind."`
`"That's it, Shii-chan!`
` I think we can make it if we leave right now."`
`It was past three o'clock. We'd make it before they closed if we rushed there on our bikes.`
`"But they're strict about time, aren't they?`
` They might kick us out as soon as it's time to close."`
`"The door will close on time.`
` But once we're inside, they'll never kick us out.`
` Listen.`
` Make sure you don't give in when negotiating with these officials.`
`Officials are surprisingly tough, but unlike private citizens, they're not allowed to end the discussion on their own.`
` So when you feel like you can't get anywhere by continuing the discussion, don't give in. `
`You have to dig deep and make sure they listen to everything we have to say!"`
`"...How do you know all that, Mii-chan?"`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` Who do you think I am? I represent Oryou Sonozaki, member of the mayor's social gathering and the local government monitoring committee.`
` I speak to government officials all the time!"`
`"Hey, Mion.`
` Is it possible to save her using the influence of the Sonozaki family...?"`
`"Well...`
` not if I have to go through Granny...`
` Ugh..."`
`"It's impossible to get help from her.`
` Her mind's still stuck in the dam conflict!`
` One hundred million with one spirit, and stuff like that!`
` She hates the Houjou family to this day."`
`"You're talking about Satoko's parents, who were for the dam project?`
` ......I've never met your grandma, but she needs to learn how to forgive.`
` It's a thing of the past now."`
`"Exactly.`
` I agree with you, Kei-chan."`
`"So the Sonozaki family can't do anything about it?"`
`"Yeah, we can't.`
` I'm sorry... Old people are so stubborn.`
` They cherish Rika-chan, but they don't care about Satoko."`
`"......That's horrible.`
` I can't forgive Satoko's uncle for aggressively abusing her, but I'm not about to forgive other people for quietly abusing her either.`
` Tell those people not to piss off Keiichi Maebara!"`
`"Aha ha ha... I'll do that."`
`"Shall we go now?`
` We have no time to waste."`
`"All right!!`
` We better hurry!`
` Let's get going!!"`
`"Do you want to come with us, Rika-chan?`
`Let's go."`
`Rena spoke to Rika-chan, who had been avoiding all conversation.`
`...She seemed to have given up all hope yesterday.`
`It was so painful to see her so depressed...`
`"...It's just a waste of time anyway."`
`"You have to stop saying 'anyway'.`
` You don't know if it's a waste of time or not unless we try."`
`"......You people did everything you could in your previous lives.`
` But you never found a way to save her. You think this time will be different?"`
`Sometimes, I really had no idea what she was saying.`
`...All I could tell is that she was being negative about the situation.`
`"Have you tried going to the child consultation center already?"`
`"........."`
`"Then we should try...`
` Satoko-chan is important to you, isn't she?`
` We have to try and see what happens.`
` I'm sure Satoko-chan needs your help right now."`
`"........This world is going to end soon anyway."`
`"What's wrong?`
` We have to hurry up."`
`"Rika-chama doesn't seem to be interested.`
` So much for friends.`
` She's so close to Satoko, but she won't even get off her butt to save her."`
`".........I never thought I'd hear you say something like that.`
` ......You used to hate her so much.`
` Hee hee."`
`"What...?`
` Is your brain working alright?`
` Why would I hate Satoko?"`
`"......Never mind.`
` Fine, I'll come with you people.`
` I have nothing to do at home but drink until I pass out anyway."`
`"You're pissing me off...`
` Are you trying to make a fool out of me?"`
`"Stop it, Shii-chan.`
` You stop it too, Rika-chan.`
`Let's get together and save Satoko-chan.`
` I'm sure we can make a miracle happen if we work together.`
`But we need everyone to come together. `
`We can't leave any one of us behind.`
`We need you too, Rika-chan."`
`Something that Rena said must have given Rika-chan motivation.`
`I could see a slight sparkle in her eyes.`
`Rena had said something interesting...`
`She said that we could make a miracle happen.`
`It's the same thing I said when this world began.`
`At that time, I said I could make a miracle happen, but I didn't say how.`
`But Rena just clearly stated that.`
`"......We can make a miracle happen if we work together."`
`"Yes.`
` Miracles can happen when we work together."`
`"......And what if there is no miracle?"`
`"That means we haven't tried hard enough.`
` If we all do the best we can, a miracle will happen for sure."`
`"That's true.`
` Ryuugu-san is right.`
` People get stronger when they help each other.`
` You can overcome any obstacle when everyone works together."`
`"Yup.`
` Hinamizawa was fated to be submerged under water.`
` But 2,000 people got together and brought an end to that destiny."`
`"Bring an end...`
` to destiny..."`
`"As villagers of Hinamizawa, we all know that miracles do happen.`
` We'll win if we work hard together!"`
`"I think you have no choice but to come with us now, Rika-chama.`
`If you don't come, a miracle won't occur. Your absence will prevent it from happening."`
`......So, it's going to be my fault.`
` That's interesting.`
`A miracle is something that we can make happen.`
`But we need everyone's power to make that come true.`
`Destiny can be defeated. Fate can be escaped from.`
` This can happen with a miracle.`
` A miracle can happen if we unite.`
`"Rena told me yesterday.`
` You'll never come up with a solution if you think about everything by yourself.`
` We have to talk this out together.`
` Don't let fate get the better of you. `
`It's as fragile as a thin sheet of paper!"`
`How can he say that... without knowing how stubborn fate can be...`
` To me, a witch trapped within fate?`
`But for some reason, his words sounded very persuasive.`
`He easily changed my fate to play the fishing game.`
`In my previous life, Keiichi saved Rena from her devastating fate.`
`As fragile as a thin sheet of paper...?`
`He's saying that the world I've been struggling in for one hundred years is that easy to change?`
`.........Hee hee hee.`
`.........Keiichi had made a fool out of me.`
`"......Interesting.`
` ......I'll go with you."`
`"That's more like you, Rika-chan!"`
`"Au...`
` ......Rika...... are you sure...?"`
`Hanyuu looked at me with concern.`
`She wanted to warn me that I'll get hurt if I expect too much.`
`"I don't have any coins left to bet...`
` I don't have anything to lose.`
` This world is ending soon anyway.`
` ......But it was the same in my previous life.`
` I thought all was lost when Rena took over the school. `
`But Keiichi turned everything around.`
` He's saying that fate is as fragile as a thin sheet of paper!`
` I've given up on this world anyway...... but I'm interested."`
`"Fate will betray you anyway......`
` I'll get hurt as I see it happen to you......"`
`"Don't worry... I'm not going to get depressed anymore.`
` I have no tears left to shed.`
` I know that they can't save Satoko no matter what happens.`
` That's why I'm doing this. `
`...It's the first time we've ever gone to the child consultation center."`
`"............Keiichi can't make any miracles happen."`
`Hanyuu spoke to me in a stern voice.`
`...Miracles are called miracles because they don't happen easily.`
`If it can happen at any time, it's not a miracle.`
` It's just something that was meant to be.`
`"I'm not expecting anything.`
` I'm just interested.`
` I'm curious how Keiichi is going to make his move after saying how easily he can change fate..."`
`"......Rika.`
` ...Please don't hurt yourself anymore."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` Get out of here."`
`I wasn't expecting anything...`
`I was just trying to enjoy my last week alive, like watching a TV show.`
`But I had to admit I was possessed by a strange feeling...`
`...It was a little bit exhilarating.`
`I was nervous, as if anticipating something.`
`I had felt the same way when Keiichi remembered the memories from the past in my previous life.`
`I didn't have any coins left to make a bet.`
`But I knew what this feeling meant.`
`If I had a coin left in my heart, I would bet everything on this feeling.`
`"......If it doesn't work out after trying every option, we'll have no choice but to give up."`
`"There's no need for us to give up!`
` Satoko is going to be saved!`
` You had better prepare a clean blanket for Satoko!`
` She's coming back to you soon.`
` And I'd feel bad if she didn't have a soft bed waiting for her!"`
`"Hee hee hee, ahhhahahahahaha.`
` I like that, Keiichi.`
` Well then, let's go...`
` You might tear apart fate like a thin sheet of paper, after all."`
`"Yeah. Right now I feel like I could take on the ruler of Hell!!`
` I'm going to make them change their decision!"`
`I stood up from my seat.`
`......Keiichi is a very good speaker.`
`That's why I never get bored with him.`
` I've been with him for a hundred years, but he still keeps me entertained.`
`"We're going to the child consultation center now.`
` Do you want to come with us, Chie-sensei?"`
`"I'm going to talk to the board of education.`
` They're under same branch of government as the child consultation center.`
` It might help if I talked to them...`
` After all, I'm working for the public, too!"`
`"That's true.`
` They might listen to what you say."`
`"Let's have her take care of that while we take care of our business.`
` Let's fight them!"`
`"Alright!`
` Let's go, everybody!"`
`"""Yeeeeah!!"""`
`Even knowing that everything is doomed, part of me felt like something good might happen.`
`Hanyuu told me that it was only a waste of time.`
`I felt the same way until a few minutes ago...`
` But I had become much more interested.`
`I had no idea what would happen.`
`I wanted to see how Keiichi was planning to defeat this destiny.`
`I raised my fist in the air along with them and hurried to the exit.`
`As for Satoko... she didn't come to the school again today.`
`Teppei called the school and told them that she still has a fever.`
`He said that he's going to keep her home for a few days until she gets better.`
`Chie said that she thinks Teppei knows she called the child consultation center.`
` He must be worried that Satoko will rat him out if he lets her go to school.`
`I don't want to think about it, but it's possible that Satoko has visible bruises by now. That could also be why he won't let her go to school.`
`Everything was happening much earlier...`
`Satoko's situation was worsening earlier than it did in my previous lives...`
