`Satoko's snoring sounded so subtle while I stood by the window.`
`"......Satoko?"`
`"Zzzzzzzz......"`
`I could tell that she was sound asleep.`
`"She snores so cutely."`
`Hanyuu laughs and tries to poke Satoko's nose.`
`I looked up at the sky.`
`Nothing was different about the moon, but the moonlight seemed warmer than usual to me.`
`"Rika, you seem to be in a good mood."`
`"Yes...`
` I think I am..."`
`I realized it only after Hanyuu pointed it out.`
`...I really was in a very good mood.`
`Otherwise, I wouldn't be enjoying the view of the sky on a humid night like this.`
`I felt like bringing a toast to the moon.`
`As I rooted around the back of the closet, Hanyuu spoke to me, sounding noticeably upset.`
`"Rika... Don't you even think about drinking..."`
`"I deserve it.`
` Just tonight."`
`Hanyuu doesn't like alcohol.`
`If I drink, Hanyuu will also taste it, so she always complains when I try to drink.`
`That's why I usually drink only when Hanyuu is far away from me.`
`Of course she'll know right away when I do, but it's too late by then...`
`"No, you can't! You're too young to be drinking!"`
`"It's my body.`
` I'm going to make my own decisions."`
`"No. I hate alcohol!`
` You can't drink!"`
`"I don't want to fight with you tonight.`
` I'll dilute it with orange juice so you can handle the taste.`
` Is that a deal?"`
`"That's not the point. I don't like the smell of alcohol.`
`So you can't drink!"`
`Hanyuu jumped around and complained.`
`She was making a lot of noise right where Satoko was sleeping.`
`"Stop that! You're going to wake her up."`
`"No I'm not.`
` Remember, you're the only one who can hear me.`
` Bleeeeh!"`
`"Hoh, just who do you think you are?"`
`I went to the refrigerator and took out a pack of orange juice and the spicy kimchi I typically use for her punishment.`
`"...Au au au!!"`
`"Let me ask you a question.`
` Would you prefer if I ate this spicy kimchi to punish you,`
` or drink a sweet orange juice cocktail while enjoying this beautiful moon instead?"`
`"Umm... umm..."`
`Hanyuu clenched her lips while jumping up and down, ready to burst into tears.`
`She should be disciplined for being that noisy,`
` but she never has been, since I'm the only one who can hear her.`
`Besides, she's like air, so I can't even give her a spanking.`
`Hanyuu loves sweets, but she really hates spicy food.`
`"Riiikaaa...`
` Would you stop jumping around...?"`
`Satoko woke up suddenly and I had to hide my glass in a hurry.`
`Satoko doesn't know about my drinking habit.`
`"What...`
` time do you think it is...?`
` Zzzz......."`
`She fell asleep again after speaking.`
`"See? She was bothered by you jumping around like that.`
` You nighttime nuisance."`
`".........Au au..."`
`Just like I'm the only one who can see her, I'm usually the only person who can hear the noise she makes.`
`However, that's not the case all the time.`
`Hanyuu does exist in this world.`
`Sometimes, people can actually hear and feel her existence.`
`It doesn't happen too often, and most people think that they just heard some random noise.`
`Based on my experience......`
` people who are in a critical condition like Satoko tend to hear her more often.`
`When I say critical condition, I mean who've reached the L4 stage, as Irie would describe it.`
`At that stage, there's nothing that can be done anymore.`
`They will feel the existence and hear the noise of someone that they can't see. That would really mess with their mind.`
`Hanyuu stopped jumping up and down and gave up as I started pouring alcohol into my glass.`
`I wasn't drinking because I wanted to be mean to Hanyuu.`
`In fact, I always wished she would enjoy it too.`
`I poured only a little bit of wine inside the glass and diluted it with plenty of orange juice.`
`In fact, this cocktail is pretty much just juice.`
`I also put some crushed ice inside the glass.`
` With that, it looked like a real cocktail they serve at the bar.`
`"See, Hanyuu?`
` It's very diluted."`
`I licked the edge of the glass to see how she'd react.`
`"I guess it's not that bad..."`
`"Good. I'll be drinking this tonight.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, all right?"`
`Hanyuu has been scared of that kimchi punishment for a while.`
`As I put it back inside the refrigerator, she seemed relieved.`
`I took the glass and headed back to the window.`
`There was no breeze, but it seemed a little bit cooler.`
`"Hey Hanyuu...`
` Do you feel that something is different this time...?"`
`"Are you talking about Keiichi and Rena...?"`
`"Shion too...`
` Everyone remembers a little bit about their past...`
` They seem to be using those memories to avoid their fatal mistakes."`
`"I don't think it would be that surprising if this was happening individually.`
` But I find it very strange that's happening to everyone all at once."`
`"......I know I often use board games as examples of fate,`
` but I feel like this is the same lucky chance as rolling all sixes on three dice."`
`"I think that's a good way to describe it in the sense that we're starting closest to your desired future.`
` ......But.`
` I don't think this is the miracle that you've been waiting for..."`
`I knew what she was trying to say.`
` She was telling me not to expect too much.`
`The die is designed to have 6 sides.`
`It's not a miracle if I roll it and get a six.`
`A true miracle is when I roll it once, but get a ten, just like what happened with Keiichi in my previous life.`
`In other words, a miracle is something that would normally never happen.`
`Keiichi gave the doll to Mion,`
` Rena spoke with her father,`
` and Shion started taking care of Satoko after remembering her promise to Satoshi.`
` That was all because they had those intentions somewhere in their hearts.`
`It was only a side of their die that was engraved there already.`
`But still, even if you couldn't call three dice rolling this well a miracle, it did mean good fortune.`
`"...I'm sure it was God's way of celebrating you finally feeling motivated to change your fate."`
`"Hee hee...`
` I thought you were one of the gods."`
`"You only treat me like a god when you're trying to tease me..."`
`"I was just kidding. Don't get upset.`
` Anyway, that's why I'm in such a good mood tonight."`
`I lifted up the glass of orange wine and gave a toast to the moon.`
`It tasted like nothing but sweet orange juice...`
`It was funny to see Hanyuu making a happy face as I took a sip.`
`".......I wonder if I can escape the death of 1983 this time."`
`"If our goal is to escape from this board, then I don't think we'll ever have such a fortunate start again."`
`No matter how hard I tried to prevent things from happening, there were some things I could never control.`
`It's such a huge letdown when that happens.`
`Even after trying so hard, something renders my efforts infertile.`
`...I'd probably been wasting my time for so long because I was trying to escape from that pain.`
`For the first time in my life, then, I've been blessed with a favorable situation.`
`Everything seems perfect in this world.`
`There's no reason for me to be depressed...`
`It's like the weather is perfect and the wind is blowing in just the right way.`
`If I failed to put my ship out to sea, there was nothing to pin the blame on.`
`"........................"`
`I understood what Hanyuu was trying to say with the concerned look on her face.`
`If I didn't escape my death under this fortunate situation,`
`I'd have to accept that my fate wasn't something that could be changed...`
`This is an ideal world where all of my friends overcame their problems.`
`I was always in a depressing world, but this time all the pieces of the puzzle matched.`
`If I couldn't change my fate in this world...`
`Then it was proof that I couldn't change it in any world.`
`That was the ending that I've been afraid of for a long time...`
`The loss of hope...`
` and the death of my soul.`
`Of the pair of us, I was probably the only one who would die.`
`Hanyuu will most likely remain there even if my spirit disappears...`
`She must be afraid of being alone after I lose myself.`
` That's why she's telling me not to expect too much.`
`I bit down on an ice chip inside my mouth. It was pleasantly cold.`
`"Hanyuu......`
` I know we've been over this many times, but I want you to think about me again..."`
`"Sure.`
`.... You want to know why you're being murdered in 1983?"`
`"Yes.`
` ............A strong will becomes fate.`
` That means that the reason I get murdered this year is because of someone's strong will."`
`"I think you're right..."`
`"Who will benefit from killing Rika Furude...?"`
`"......If that person has a strong will, there must be a clear motive for them doing so."`
`"It might sound odd coming from me...`
` but I think most people like Rika Furude.`
` I don't think any villager would have the motive to kill me."`
`"The people who live in this village are all fond of you..."`
`"Thanks to you."`
`"......Au au au..."`
`"I'm just showing you my appreciation.`
` Anyway...`
` We now know that the Sonozaki family is not the culprit...`
` I have no idea who else would want to kill me."`
`".........You know,`
` this village is supposed to be the safest place in the world for you."`
`"You're right.`
` It's supposed to be.`
` There are plenty of people who would protect me here."`
`It's ironic.`
` For a long time, I've been refusing help from all those people who were trying to keep me safe.`
`"........Rika.`
` I think we should rely on Irie..."`
`"............"`
`People in this village love and cherish me.`
`But no matter what, they never save me when I try to escape the fate of my death.`
`I spoke to several villagers in the past, but they never believed me and none of them saved me in the end.`
`They probably didn't believe me because I had no idea who was trying to kill me, or what their motive was.`
`If I could explain that, people might be more accepting of my story...`
`But there's nothing I can do about that.`
`No one would believe a little girl saying that she's going to be killed without rhyme or reason.`
`All they think of me as is the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama and the leader of the Furude family.`
`They do cherish me, but they won't protect me with their lives.`
`On the other hand, Irie and his people are totally different.`
`They realize how special I am, and they would try to make sure that nothing happens to me.`
`If I confessed to them that my life was in danger, I'm sure they would do their best to prevent it.`
`They have all the means to protect me from a violent end.`
`However, none of it really worked in the past...`
`It's not that they're unreliable.`
`It's because Takano, the one responsible for protecting me, also gets killed on the same day every time.`
`In other words, asking her for help is completely useless.`
`She's very reliable, but she also isn't.`
`It's ironic that I'm the only one who knows the reason why they can never save me.`
`"I wonder if that's the murderer's plan...`
` Tomitake and Takano get killed`
` because they're my guardians...`
` Then I get killed after that..."`
`"I think Takano's death is definitely related to your own..."`
`"If it's the same fate...`
` I mean, if the same suspect is killing them for the same motive...`
` I might be able to alter my own outcome by preventing their deaths."`
`"I don't know if you remember, but we've tried that once before..."`
`The deaths of Takano and Tomitake mean the loss of my protection.`
`Because the two of them die, the suspect is able to kill me.`
`That's why I've tried to prevent their deaths somehow...`
`But they never believed me.`
`I tried so hard to persuade them, but they didn't listen.`
`I eventually gave up and just thought of their deaths as fated to happen.`
`It's the same hopeless feeling I used to have toward my parents when I was able to go farther back in time.`
`When I found out that death was inevitable, I lost interest in them...`
`After all that time had passed, I forgot how hard I used to try to prevent my parents' deaths...`
`".......Besides, I thought you hated Irie and his people."`
`"Yeah...`
` They look at us as nothing but their guinea pigs."`
`I support them so I can help Satoko.`
`But it disgusts me to think that they're only using me as a test subject.`
`I've been resenting Irie for that reason.`
`Still, I should try to get closer to him.`
`After all, he's the only person who understands how important I am.`
`He's the main person I should be talking to, and he has the most potential for protecting me.`
`I can't avoid seeking help from him just because I don't like him.`
`I've asked him for help several times before...`
`But Tomitake and Takano get murdered even so, and it ruins everything.`
`After their deaths, Irie panics and becomes useless.`
`That's why I gave up on seeking help from him.`
`But in this world, I've been blessed with a positive situation.`
`I will never have as lucky a start as this again.`
`This is the best chance I'll ever get, so I should give it my best shot.`
`I really don't like him at all...`
`But he's not a bad person.`
`I should respect him more.`
`He's serious about helping Satoko, and he's not as much of a mad scientist as I'm inclined to think.`
`Takano is a strange person too, but she's also someone who can give me support.`
`But she thinks I'm only her guinea pig.`
`That's why I don't really want her help...`
`Tomitake is more reliable than Takano.`
`But the biggest problem is that he only visits this village a few times a year.`
` ...On top of that, he always dies before I get killed, so he can never help me.`
`However, they really are the people I should be talking to.`
`If I can change the fate of their deaths...`
` They should be able to save me from my own.`
`It's possible that the only reason I lived until 1983 was because of their effort...`
`"I'm going to approach them once more, and do what I can to try and save them.`
` ...Oh, don't worry.`
` I expect they'll be murdered anyways, so I'm not getting my hopes up. `
`So I'll be fine, even if this hope's betrayed."`
`"Au... You're such a cruel girl..."`
`I chuckled at her comment.`
`"If they can escape their fated deaths, then I'm sure they'll greatly influence my own destiny as well.`
` ...And this time I'm going to try talking to them with the assumption they'll still be killed. `
`In short, I'll talk to them about how I'll be protected from my coming danger after they die.`
` If they issue such orders, then maybe the guard around me will be strengthened after they do."`
`The protection they provide is probably the highest standard of security I could hope for.`
`Yet I lose that the moment Tomitake and Takano die.`
`So I never have their protection after Watanagashi.`
`And therefore, I get killed too.`
`In other words,`
` that's it.`
`Whoever possesses the strong will to kill me actually just wants me dead.`
`Yet so long as those two are alive, there's tight security all around Hinamizawa.`
`That prevents the killer from getting to me.`
`So...`
` to kill me,`
` they must first kill Tomitake and Takano, the heart of that security.`
`Then my protection falls away, leaving me exposed...`
`"The more I reason it out, the more I realize their fates are connected to mine.`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
` Thinking from that point of view, my destiny becomes inescapable the moment I abandon them to die."`
`"You should know what you have to do first then..."`
`"Yes.`
` I have to think about saving their lives, before thinking about mine."`
`It's kind of ironic.`
`I gave up on them because I was more determined to save my own life.`
`But I finally came to the conclusion that I have to help them first, before helping myself.`
`............But there's something I still don't understand.`
`Someone with convictions this strong is trying to kill me for some equally strong motive.`
`Yet no matter how often I debate it, I can't think of anyone who'd benefit from my death.`
`Not only that, but there should only be people who'd want to protect me...`
`Especially since they would do anything to protect me and the present environment.`
`They even eliminated my mother.`
`...To be perfectly honest, I don't even care about her anymore.`
`I never got along with her, and she's the one who took my father's death the wrong way, making a huge deal out of it like she did.`
`She got what she deserved.`
`I'm a valuable guinea pig for them, and I can be a 'bomb' too.`
`No one benefits from making me explode.`
`There's only disaster awaiting them if that happens.`
`Lots of people will be lost, and nobody would gain anything from that.`
`According to Takano, my death would be like the eruption of a volcano in the middle of the village.`
`I'm not interested in what happens after my death, but they're really concerned about it.`
`They're watching me every day to ensure that I don't accidentally hit my head on the corner of a block of tofu and die.`
`It's fair to say that they are here in order to prevent the 'eruption' from happening.`
`I'd be suspicious of them if they were going to benefit in some way from my death.`
`But as everyone knows, that can't possibly be the case.`
`My death would create nothing but a disaster.`
`They're benefiting from my being alive right now.`
`"...Perhaps it's not about gain, but about a grudge...`
` Maybe someone has a strong grudge against my family, and kills me not knowing that I'm like a bomb to this village."`
`That's why I was suspicious of the Three Families, especially the Sonozaki family.`
`However...`
` after observing them in numerous worlds,`
` I feel that's not the case.`
`I felt that way in several lives, but it always had something to do with that incident with Keiichi and the doll.`
`It's clear that there's nothing going on between the Sonozaki family and mine.`
`"In that case...`
` it must be some religious fanatic..."`
`If it's not about profit or a grudge, it might be someone who's secretly a deranged cultist...`
`We've already had a series of murders four years in a row under the name of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`Timing-wise, it would somewhat interesting if I, the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, were killed on the fifth year.`
`...I couldn't stand to be murdered for such a whimsical reason, but such a motive actually seemed fitting.`
`Ironically, I would have to suspect Takano, if that's the case.`
`She's well known for being an eccentric researcher of local histories.`
`She's only interested in the village's history because she already knows who I am.`
`She's doing the research based on the notion that I'm important.`
`So she should have no reason to kill me.`
`She would desire to keep me close to her, as a research sample.`
`It's hard to believe that she would kill her favorite toy.`
`She might be willing to kill someone who would try to harm her little toy, though.`
`"...I will never find out no matter how hard I think.`
` I just know that someone is definitely going to kill me.`
` I don't care about anything else, as long as I can escape that fate."`
`No, I take that back.`
`I want to escape my deadly fate,`
` but I also want all of my friends to be happy`
` and I want the rest of my life to be happy too.`
`I don't want to hide myself in the forest forever just to get away from my murderer.`
`............In fact I've tried that once before, but I still met with the same ending.`
`Living in the forest was a horrible experience.`
`I think I was able to survive until July that time.`
` ...That might be the longest I ever lived.`
`I smiled bitterly and finished off the rest of the orange wine in the glass.`
`I'd have to talk to Irie again.`
`I don't like him, but his people are my only hope.`
`"It's getting late...`
` I should go to sleep now."`
`"I think so too.`
` Good night."`
`I lay down and closed my eyes, but I couldn't fall asleep right away.`
`Suddenly, I remembered Rena's words out of nowhere.`
`"It was no good when I was thinking about it on my own."`
`I wasn't thinking about it on my own...`
` I was talking it out with Hanyuu...`
`"Now I know.`
` It's important to talk to other people.`
` Friends have greater meaning than I thought.`
` You can talk to them about anything. I finally realized that..."`
`After I ask Takano for help, should I also talk to Keiichi...?`
`I've told him before in my previous lives.`
`But he never believed me then...`
