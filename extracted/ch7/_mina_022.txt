`Tomitake gathered up his paperwork and slipped it inside his bag.`
`"They sure were persistent.`
` Hahaha, I wonder if they really want us dead."`
`"Hee hee.`
` ...How rude of them, huh? It was only a dream."`
`"Please make sure that Dr. Irie examines Rika-chan.`
` Her nightmares might be a symptom of something.`
` If anything happens to her, it would be a disaster."`
`Takano touched Tomitake's hand gently.`
`As he turned bright red, Takano moved in closer and spoke.`
`The way she acts is just too sexy, Tomitake thought.`
`"............Hey, Jirou-san.`
` I have something very important to tell you.`
` Will you listen to me?"`
`"Wha, what is it?`
` ...You have something to tell me too?`
` Haha, hahaha... I hope you didn't see me claw out my throat in a dream.`
` Hahahaha."`
`".........What would you say if I did?"`
`"...Eh......?"`
`Takano stared at him with a mischievous look, as if seducing him...`
`and started whispering into his ear.`
`"...Hee hee.`
` ......I'm really surprised.`
` That girl might have a godlike power after all.`
` Hee hee hee hee."`
`"Umm... ahaha, what does that mean...?"`
`Takano smiled gently and pulled back her hair.`
`...Even seeing her do that made Tomitake's heart race.`
`"...I really like you."`
`"Th-That's good to know...`
` Ahahahaha..."`
`Takano's fingers curled around Tomitake's chin, stroking, tickling, and caressing it.`
`Her movements were very captivating and seductive.`
`"...I've dated a lot of guys, but none of them interested me as much as you.`
` I've learned that someone with a personality like yours makes the ideal partner for me. `
`...You're willing to accept everything I stand for.`
` I believe that you understand me completely.`
` ...That's why I can give you everything I have.`
` ......I want you to accept everything about me... `
`Do you understand...?"`
`"............Um.`
` ...Well, Takano-san...`
` What's the matter...?"`
`Her voice didn't really sound that affectionate.`
`...Tomitake knew from experience that he couldn't grasp what was on her mind when she wore a cold smile like that.`
`"......Finally.`
` ...It's almost here."`
`It seemed as though she couldn't wait for something to happen.`
`There was a chilling allure to her strange smile... that made one question if something exciting was really about to happen.`
`"......What... what's almost here?"`
`Tomitake asked, trying hard to resist the temptation.`
`"............The day`
` my dream comes true."`
`"Your...`
`...`
`..`
` dream..."`
`"Yes.`
` My dream.`
` ............Didn't I tell you before?`
` Or do you forget about everything we talk about in bed...?"`
`"N-No...`
` I remember,`
` .........your...`
` dream..."`
`Tomitake's response was vague.`
`Either he didn't remember, or he hadn't understood it very well.`
`"......Finally... the curse of Oyashiro-sama is going to come true.`
` That's what I've been dreaming about ever since I was a child.`
` ...Hee hee hee."`
`"............."`
`"...Jirou-san.`
` Listen.`
` .........I can't be with you anymore."`
`"What...?`
` ...Wh-What do you mean...?"`
`".........You see, I belong in a different world.`
` ...Hinamizawa is where humans and demons once coexisted.`
` ......That's why we met each other here.`
` ......But all that is going to come to an end soon. `
`...The eclipse of the sun brought humans and demons together.`
`.........Do you understand what I'm saying?`
` ......Hee hee hee hee."`
`"Takano-san...... did you drink a bit too much at the festival?`
` ...Ahahaha... you're drunk, right?"`
`"......Tonight is a night of farewells.`
` ...Thank you for teaching me about the sunlit realm.`
` Your warmth was like the glow of the midday sun.`
` ...We really did have a wonderful relationship. `
`...I'm so sad that we have to say goodbye."`
`She pulled herself away from Tomitake and slowly stepped back.`
`...As if signaling the time had come for them to part.`
`"...I don't know what you're trying to say...`
` What's this all about, Takano-san...?"`
`"............I want you to make a decision.`
` I want you to decide to stay with me, and abandon the sunlit realm.`
` ......If what you told me was all true............ then I know you have no doubts..."`
`...By that time, Tomitake understood that Takano was asking him to make an important decision.`
`".........Could it be...... you're........."`
`"...Hee hee.`
` ...That's right.`
` ...Jirou-san."`
`Tomitake got up from his seat and looked Takano straight in the eyes.`
`...There was a faint glimmer of hostility within those eyes.`
`".........Is your work... more important than me...?`
` ...I thought so..."`
`"...I can't believe this...`
` I trusted you...!"`
`Those words were ones of rejection.`
` ...Takano's lips twisted into a cruel smile.`
`".........Oyashiro-sama united the humans and the demons...`
` but I guess he can't unite you and me.`
` .........Hee hee hee hee."`
`Takano slowly opened the door.`
`Six men in overalls were standing there at the ready.`
`Tomitake was frozen in shock.`
`The six men walked up to Tomitake with no expressions on their faces.`
`It was immediately obvious that they were going to do something to harm him.`
`"...What is this all about!?"`
`"Hinamizawa Syndrome is like a bomb with a lit fuse.`
` Your plan is to dismantle that bomb before it explodes.`
`...However, there are some people in Tokyo who want to see it go off."`
`"No!`
` What good will that do for anyone?"`
`"Nobody ever does anything that isn't beneficial to them.`
` Therefore, if they want that bomb to explode, it must be doing good for someone.`
` Your question just now is a pretty meaningless one."`
`"...I-I can't believe this.`
` There are people who want that to happen?`
` Hinamizawa Syndrome is a very dangerous disease! You know that as well as I do!"`
`"I do. It would be a disaster if it had an outbreak.`
` Tokyo wouldn't be able to cover it up, either."`
`"...D-Did that faction bribe you?"`
`"It was actually my mission from the very start.`
` ...I'm so sorry.`
` We belonged in different worlds from the moment we first met."`
`"......What are you going to do to me...?"`
`"It would be a great help if you came over to our side.`
` Of course, that would mean that you'd have to betray your own people."`
`"...You're expecting me to turn on them...?"`
`"Jirou-san.`
` If your feelings for me are real, will you support me?`
` You'll be compensated, of course.`
` If you wish, I'll dedicate my whole life to you.`
` I'll do whatever you want me to, whenever and wherever you want. `
`My body will belong to you.`
` You can dominate me to satisfy your needs whenever you like.`
` ......I'm willing to be all yours.`
` ...Hey, don't you want to dye this body of mine in your scent...?"`
`Her words were a kind of assault, directly hammering at the emotions men had difficulty resisting.`
`They were like an evil spell to control his heart.`
`Upon hearing them, Tomitake felt an unknown sensation rush up his spine as his feet froze in place, entranced.`
`...However, he forced himself to resist the temptation.`
`He sealed the cracks in his wall of reason to stop Takano from forcefully entering his heart...`
`"Ugh...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`... I refuse...!"`
`"Hee hee hee,`
` ahahahahahahahahahahahaha ha ha ha ha!"`
`She had known from the start that Tomitake was going to refuse her.`
`Even so, Takano let out a triumphant laugh.`
`It's funny.`
` She thought Tomitake would refuse right away.`
`However, it took him a while to refuse because of how effective she was at seducing him.`
`The time it took him to refuse her was one of victory for Takano.`
`For Tomitake, it was a time of humiliation.`
`Takano continued to laugh.`
`She sounded rather like an evil witch.`
`"......I thought you would say that.`
` That's why I love you so much."`
`Takano raised up her right hand and gave a signal to the Mountain Dogs.`
`"Okonogi-kun... You're betraying me too?"`
`"...I'm sorry, Lieutenant Tomitake."`
`"Are you surprised?`
` The Mountain Dogs work for me.`
` It was us who controlled this clinic all along.`
` You and Dr. Irie are the only people who didn't know...`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`"......Shit...!"`
`Tomitake moved into action, sensing the danger that was about to befall him.`
`His fist thrust out as quick as lightning, knocking one man down before he could even blink.`
`However, the other Mountain Dogs certainly weren't going to just stay there and watch.`
`They all attacked him as one.`
`He tried to strike back with an elbow, but he simply couldn't overcome the difference in numbers.`
`Tomitake tried his best, but soon enough the Mountain Dogs had wrestled him to the ground.`
`"D-Dammiiiiiiit!!!`
` Let go! Let me go!!"`
`"Stop struggling already!!`
` Waaaaaagh...!!"`
`They pinned him down so that he couldn't move an inch.`
`"Impressive, Jirou-san.`
` You fought pretty well, considering you were up against six people."`
`Takano walked over and smiled while looking down at Tomitake.`
`"............Hey, Jirou-san.`
` I know you're going to refuse, but let me ask you one more time...`
` Will you change your mind and join my side...?"`
`"...N-Never...!`
` I'll never join with you...!!`
` Uuugh...!!"`
`"That's what I wanted to hear.`
` So I could sever all my attachments.`
` Hee hee hee hee."`
`Takano was holding a small case in her hands.`
`She opened it and showed Tomitake what was inside.`
`"...Wha...... What's in that syringe......?"`
`"Oh, come now.`
` I'm sure you know what it is.`
` Hee hee."`
`"...No...`
` We destroyed all of them...!!"`
`"Jirou-san...`
` Let me guess what you're thinking.`
` Even if this is what you think it is, you should still have immunity because you took the vaccine.`
` ...Hee hee.`
` Isn't that what you're thinking? `
`That's why you're not scared, right?`
` ...Well, let me tell you something nice. That vaccine you took before you came here was fake. `
`You may not have noticed it, but you're already an L3 patient of the Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
` Jirou-san, you have a tendency to look away when you get an injection.`
` That's not very smart. `
`You should always make sure of what you're getting.`
` Hee hee hee hee."`
`"Sh-Shiiiiiiiit!!`
` Let me go!!"`
`Tomitake struggled to get away, but he simply couldn't move.`
`Upon seeing his sorry state, Takano laughed with glee.`
`"......I'm sure you know very well about H173.`
` You'll become infected instantly, and will virtually become an L5 patient.`
` You saw how the experiment turned out, no? `
`The subject was displaying extreme irritation in the neck and armpit areas.`
` Based on our past studies, patients with L5 suffer from extraordinary irritation in their lymph nodes. `
`It might be an antigen-antibody reaction.`
` ...In other words, Jirou-san...`
` If you're lucky, you might be able to die just as Rika-chan predicted.`
` Hee hee hee hee! `
`Are you going to kill yourself, or become disabled for life...?`
` Which would you prefer...?`
` Which one, Jirou-san?`
` Hee hee hee hee!!"`
`"Stop... Stooooop!!"`
`"It's going to be too difficult to give him the injection like this.`
` Put him to sleep, please."`
`One of the men covered Tomitake's mouth with a towel soaked in some kind of chemical.`
`He tried to fight it off with all his might, but his strength eventually left him, and he became as quiet as a beached whale.`
`Takano stroked his face to make sure that he couldn't resist.`
`Then she brought the needle toward his throat.`
`She pushed it right into his skin.`
`...As she squeezed down... on the syringe's plunger,`
` the skin surrounding the tip of the needle swelled up...`
` ...and eventually the contents were absorbed into his body.`
`"Goodbye, Jirou-san.`
` When you wake up, you'll be in the middle of a wonderful nightmare.`
` Hee hee hee hee."`
`The Mountain Dogs finally got off of him.`
`He couldn't even twitch.`
`"Someone put him in my trunk."`
`Two of the men lifted up Tomitake and carried him outside.`
`"...Oh, hold on.`
` I'm sure he'd be happy if I left him his bicycle.`
` That way, he can enjoy cycling in hell too."`
`The Mountain Dogs all quietly laughed at the joke.`
`"We are now going to commence Operation Doomsday."`
`They stopped laughing as she began to speak.`
`"Okonogi, you wait for the contact from headquarters.`
` Keep your eyes on Dr. Irie.`
` Also, keep tabs on Rika Furude too.`
` I don't know what kind of power she has... but she predicted how Tomitake was going to die.`
`...Hee hee.`
` I'm very curious about her... but too bad."`
`"Roger.`
` I'll take care of things here.`
` Please be careful on your way."`
`"There's not much to be careful of.`
` By the way, where's Dr. Irie...?"`
`"I'm sure he's attending the festival's afterparty.`
` He's still at the shrine."`
`"I wish I could see the look of panic on that nerd's face.`
` Hee hee."`
`The Mountain Dogs started laughing again too.`
`Takano checked the time on her watch.`
`It was nearly 10 PM.`
`Most people must have left the festival for home.`
`Those people still there were probably enjoying the afterparty while getting drunk inside the shrine.`
`It was a good time for her to leave without being seen by anyone.`
`"I'm leaving now.`
` I'm going to go and die.`
` Hee hee..."`
`After saying that, she left the clinic alone.`
`She left through the back door.`
`She left amid the moonlight, the singing of insects, and the sound of a river...`
`It was a typical night in Hinamizawa.`
`...While enjoying all these sensations, Takano got inside her car.`
`Tomitake was sleeping inside the trunk.`
`His bicycle, on the other hand, was loaded into her back seat.`
`...Hee hee.`
` How ironic.`
`Your bicycle has a better seat than you.`
`I'll let you out of there soon.`
`I should leave him by the road that leads to Okinomiya.`
` That'll be a good spot.`
`Takano found a good place to drop him off,`
` but she gave up on it, as there was a police cruiser parked in the area.`
`...She figured that they were probably patrolling to make sure the fifth year's curse didn't happen.`
`Good job, officers.`
`No one would ever suspect that there's a curse packed in my trunk right now.`
`Takano drove onto less-lit streets with rougher roads.`
`Eventually the mountain road ended, and she was surrounded by darkness.`
`There were rice fields nearby.`
`She could tell by the sound of the croaking frogs.`
`Takano parked her car by the pitch black roadside.`
`She had to stop here, otherwise she'd be too close to a residential area.`
`Indeed, she was nearly in Okinomiya.`
`She would have dumped him earlier, but the police cruiser had foiled that plan.`
`Takano pulled Tomitake out of the trunk and left him by the road.`
` She also left him his bicycle.`
`Tomitake let out a small groan.`
`...It probably wouldn't be long until he woke up.`
`"Good bye, Jirou-san.`
` Your awkward sweet talk was very entertaining.`
` I wish I could hear it again.`
` Hee hee.`
` You'll be waking up soon.`
` By that time, you'll be in the final stage of L5. `
`After a futile struggle, you'll meet with a miserable demise.`
` I wonder if you really are going to claw out your throat and die...`
` I wish I could be here to see it.`
` Hee hee.`
`Your mysterious death and my disappearance will complete the fifth year's curse of Oyashiro-sama. `
`The story of the curse of Oyashiro-sama will be firmly established.`
` You should feel honored... Jirou-san. You're going to be part of history! `
`You might be losing your life here, but in a way, you're going to live for eternity.`
` ............Hee hee hee hee."`
`That was her last farewell to Tomitake.`
`Takano got back inside her car and started driving.`
`She could see the place she left Tomitake in her rearview mirror, but it was already shrouded in darkness.`
`Takano drove through the main street of Okinomiya and made a few turns, heading for the dark mountains in the distance.`
`It had been a while since she left Hinamizawa.`
`It was almost midnight.`
`She might have already made it to the neighboring prefecture.`
`...It was difficult to tell because she couldn't really see anything in the darkness.`
`Takano stopped her car in the middle of all that.`
`After turning off both the engine and the headlights, there really was nothing but darkness surrounding her.`
`It was as if time itself had stopped.`
`Takano wasn't sure how long she waited, but eventually she saw the headlights of a car blinking twice.`
`She blinked her own headlights back at it.`
`Soon, she saw several people walking toward her.`
`Two men wearing blue overalls knocked on the window of Takano's car.`
`Obligingly, she opened it.`
`They looked over her face and the paperwork they had in their hands.`
`"Hello.`
` I'm Takano."`
`After confirming her identification, they called someone over the radio.`
`"Hello...`
` We've got the lady.`
` Anyone following?"`
`"......Sss...`
` sss...`
`... No one is after you. You're clear for 400 meters."`
`"Nobody's following us.`
` Your work is much appreciated.`
` Please come with us to the command vehicle.`
` I'll take your paperwork."`
`"The paperwork is inside the trunk.`
` Here's the key.`
` I do need some coffee.`
` Could you get me some?"`
`The command vehicle was a trailer with a bunch of high tech communication equipment inside.`
`The light of the electric equipment shone beautifully in the dark.`
`"Here's your coffee, Major."`
`Another man in blue overalls offered her a paper cup.`
`"Thank you.`
` What's going on with my corpse?"`
`"They've finished setting it up in Gifu Prefecture."`
`"Gifu?`
` Did I burn to death in the mountains of Gifu?"`
`"I'm not sure about the cause of death...`
` I'll confirm it with someone."`
`Operation Doomsday.`
`That was the name of their mission.`
`The goal of the operation's first stage was Takano's escape from Hinamizawa and the extraction of eighteen specific classified documents.`
`That goal had been completed.`
`Assassinating the liaison from Tokyo, Tomitake, was also one of the goals.`
`That one had also been completed in the way Takano had planned.`
`He was not killed that way just because Takano had wanted to see it.`
`It was intentionally planned that way, so that the office in Tokyo would be suspicious of the Irie Institute.`
`They were trying to create the story that the Institute was upset with the recent budget cuts and the cancellation of their study.`
`Tomitake's mysterious death would be a suitable way to persuade people.`
`Tomitake was not the only one who was expected to die. Takano was expected to do so as well.`
`However, Takano didn't really need to die herself.`
`They had acquired a substitute body for her, so she didn't have to actually die.`
`Takano had no idea how they got the body.`
`According to what she heard, a team in Gifu took care of everything.`
`Once Tomitake and Takano were dead, Tokyo would definitely grow suspicious of the Irie Institute.`
`The main purpose of this mission was to make the Institute look reckless...`
`"I'm sorry, Major...`
` There's been a problem in Gifu."`
`"...A problem?`
` What sort of problem?"`
`"They made a mistake with the corpse.`
` The body has already been dead for twenty-four hours..."`
`"...I see. Then I wonder how things will play out.`
` In other words, you're saying I was already dead as of yesterday."`
`Takano's body was supposed to be selected from the corpses of people who had died the same day.`
`The plan was to then burn the body and make identification of the corpse more difficult.`
`They'd found a suitable body for the plan...`
` However, they just found out that it had been dead for over a day.`
`...That would create a hole in their plans.`
`"They're going to collect another body to use instead..."`
`"Hee hee.`
` No, that's fine.`
` We can still use that body as me."`
`"Huh...?`
` But that would mean..."`
`"The messenger of Oyashiro-sama was long dead, but came to the festival regardless......`
`Hee hee... that's a good one.`
` That's a very, very good one.`
` ...Heh heh heh heh...!"`
`Takano laughed with satisfaction for a while.`
`The other people in the vehicle couldn't understand why Takano was laughing so much.`
`Takano continued to laugh as if it was the funniest thing she'd ever heard.`
`"Go ahead.`
` Call the team in Gifu and tell them to stop looking for another body.`
` I think this will make for an interesting twist."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` Shouldn't you be more cautious...?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` Everyone saw Miyo Takano walking around at the Watanagashi festival. `
`Even if the forensics lab does find out that the body's been dead for more than a day, they'll just think that the test results were wrong.`
` Hee hee hee hee!"`
`Takano almost seemed to be enjoying the risk.`
`"...R-Roger.`
` I'll notify them."`
`"By the way...`
` Was my body burned inside of an oil drum?"`
`"Yes.`
` It seems someone already discovered it on the mountain near the freeway."`
`Takano seemed surprised to hear that from him.`
`Then she started laughing strangely again.`
`Nobody could figure out why she was laughing like that.`
`"I see.`
` ...The reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama really is gifted.`
`.........I have to admit, she has a supernatural power that defies explanation.`
` ...Tell the Mountain Dogs in Hinamizawa to tighten up security on R."`
`"Roger."`
`"Major...`
` The Okinomiya police department has discovered the body of Tomitake."`
`"...They have, huh?`
` The show is about to begin.`
` Hee hee hee hee!"`
`"Ooishi-san, Dr. Irie has arrived."`
`"Oh, thank you for coming!`
`So, what do you think, Dr. Irie?"`
`Ooishi entered the area enclosed by a blue tarp.`
`In there, people from forensics were taking pictures of the dead body from various angles.`
`Irie was squatting down next to the dead body of Jirou Tomitake.`
` ...When he stood up, he was white as a sheet.`
`".........I can't believe it."`
`"...Yup. I can't believe it, either.`
` As far as I see... he clawed out his throat`
` with his bare hands.`
`This isn't a normal way to die.`
` Most likely, some kind of dangerous drug must have caused it."`
`"...Are you saying that he was a drug addict?"`
`"I don't know, was he?`
` It's going to be my job to find that out."`
`"............Ooishi-san,`
` what's this two-by-four doing here?"`
`"I think... he was swinging it around.`
` And then, he threw it away, and he had more fun clawing out his throat, I guess."`
`"......Why was he swinging the two-by-four around?"`
`"He probably did it in self-defense.`
` ...Did you notice there are several external injuries on his body?"`
`"...Yes. I can see some bruises."`
`"The easiest explanation I can think of is this`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` He was attacked by someone on his way home to Okinomiya after the festival.`
` He was seized by the culprit, given a shot of some kind of dangerous drug, went crazy, and died."`
`"...I've never heard of any drug that can make people claw out their throats."`
`"I'm not an expert on it, either... but they say self-harm is one of the terminal symptoms for drug addicts, right?`
` Well, I'm sure the old man in forensics will take care of the investigation."`
`"Excuse me, Ooishi-san!`
` We found a bicycle believed to belong to Jirou Tomitake a mile away from here."`
`"Oh, is that so. Thank you.`
` Did you find anything on it?"`
`"Not yet.`
` They're investigating it right now."`
`"So, that means ...the place where the bicycle was found is most likely the place he was attacked.`
` ...And he ran away from the culprit and came here... ...Hummmm."`
`Ooishi frowned, crossing his arms in front of his chest.`
`Irie was looking at the miserable corpse of Tomitake, and he kept saying the same thing.`
`"...............It's impossible.`
` ...It's just impossible."`
`Irie knew right away that Tomitake's death was caused by the terminal symptoms of Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`He hadn't swung the two-by-four at a real person, but probably saw some kind of hallucination due to the L5 symptoms.`
`Violent reactions to hallucinations is one of the clearest characteristics of the terminal stage.`
`However, Tomitake supposedly took a vaccine before he came to the village.`
`There was no way he could reach L5 symptoms in such a short period of time.`
`Irie didn't want to believe it...`
` but it was obvious that someone intentionally injected him with the pathogen.`
`The pathogen must have been strong enough to give him L5 symptoms immediately.`
`The only drug that can do that... is H173.`
`A chemical weapon that induces an acute onset of symptoms.`
`It makes people hallucinate, which inevitably leads to a horrible death...`
` It's the absolute worst kind`
` of demon.`
`However, they had destroyed all of it due to its dangerous nature.`
`All that was left were helpful chemicals, such as vaccines and treatment drugs...`
`...Tomitake was their liaison from Tokyo.`
`Whoever killed him must have had full knowledge about him and this drug.`
`...How would that person know he was their liaison?!`
`It was then that Irie thought of Takano.`
`Takano is also a watchdog from Tokyo.`
`She's something like a superintendent.`
`...It was quite possible that something bad had happened to her too.`
`"What about... Takano-san?`
` What happened to Takano-san?!"`
`"What?`
` Oh, are you talking about your nurse?"`
`"I think she was with him.`
` Is she okay?!"`
`"...Do you know her phone number?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Kuma-chan.`
` Get her phone number from Dr. Irie and have someone at the station call her home."`
`"Understood!`
` Doctor, can I have the number?"`
`"Yes, ummm... Here it is."`
`Kumagai got the phone number, repeated it to make sure he got it right, and dashed out of the blue tent.`
`"Doctor.`
` ...Takano-san and Tomitake-san were close friends, weren't they?"`
`"Yes."`
`"...Have you heard about any troubles between them?"`
`"No.`
` ......Not even once.`
` They were very close friends."`
`Tomitake and Takano weren't just in a close relationship.`
`They were coworkers sent from Tokyo.`
`They had access to information that even Irie didn't.`
`There's no way there was trouble between them.`
`"Well, I hope she's alright.`
` ...In the worst case scenario, she could be dead, or she could even be the perp.`
` ...Hmmm, I see. Nurses do have access to dangerous drugs, don't they?"`
`"...We don't have any drugs like that at my clinic. Even if we did, we'd store them with extra care.`
` There's no way Takano-san could smuggle out a drug from my clinic..."`
`"But it's easier for nurses to do it than for regular people, right?"`
`"Like I said, I've never heard of a drug like that, and I don't have anything like that in my clinic...!"`
`Irie made clumsy excuses while he tried to piece together what was going on.`
`...However, Irie had no means of knowing the state of affairs in Tokyo, and he couldn't reach any further conclusions.`
` So it was easy to laugh at him, as though he's a frog trapped in a well.`
`"Ooishi-san, she isn't home.`
` The standby unit says they're going to go to her house to check."`
`"Doctor, can you give me her address?`
` Kuma-chan,`
` can you also check if the police headquarters has found any unidentified female bodies tonight?`
` ...Maybe we should check with the other prefectures, too. `
`Get the section manager to call all the nearby prefectural headquarters and ask if they have any unidentified female bodies."`
`"Yes sir!"`
`"The Okinomiya police department is contacting the Gifu prefectural police department."`
`"Are you sure about this, Major...?"`
`"Sure.`
` I don't mind.`
` Just leave it there.`
` Doomsday has almost arrived, anyway.`
` Everything will be destroyed before they even find out that the time of death doesn't match.`
` Hee hee hee!"`
