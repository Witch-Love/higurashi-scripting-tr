`Teppei returned to Hinamizawa to escape some trouble.`
`He'd have to stay there for the rest of the summer, perhaps the whole year, and see what happened.`
`For him, the house in Hinamizawa was like a rather dull hiding place.`
`His lover Rina had suddenly disappeared.`
`Rumors told him that she was involved with some dangerous deal.`
`Some source even told him that she had already been caught and killed.`
`Everyone he knew was aware that Rina was living with him.`
`Everyone also assumed that he knew everything about what Rina did.`
` They were convinced that he got money by tricking her into doing something, and as a result, some dangerous men came after him.`
`That made it difficult for him to stay in Okinomiya.`
`More than anything, it pissed him off to find out that Rina was cooking up something behind his back with some other guys.`
`Hinamizawa was about the only place he could go.`
`He couldn't go back to the house where he used to live with his wife, as it had been abandoned since he moved into Satoko's house.`
`...Besides, he didn't even have the key to his old place.`
`But if he went to Satoko's house, she should still be there, and she could clean and cook for him too.`
`Teppei didn't know how to cook or clean, and he certainly wasn't thinking of learning.`
`Rina had often been rebellious towards Teppei.`
` He had often said that he wanted to be with someone more loyal, like a pet. For Teppei, Satoko was exactly what he wanted.`
`As Satoko is still a little kid, she can't satisfy him sexually, but he can at least make her wash his back in the bath.`
`Satoko's dead mother used to be a pretty woman...`
`Satoko might grow up to become a pretty lady herself in about four or five years...`
`Teppei headed back to Hinamizawa with those indecent thoughts in his head.`
`The house was locked, so he assumed that she was at the market for grocery shopping.`
` He found her at the store and dragged her back home.`
`However, the house was full of dust.`
`She'd been living at her friend's house for the past year, and the house had been abandoned.`
`Teppei exploded in anger.`
`He told her that it was her responsibility to keep the house in order.`
`He beat her and kicked her down to the floor.`
`Eventually Satoko's expression returned to what he remembered from 1982.`
`Satoko started obeying him immediately, and cleaned up the house.`
`A new place to hide with a new girl.`
`His new life was starting out pretty good.`
`Teppei called his buddies to show off his new beginning, and ended up playing mahjong with them.`
`He bragged about his new pet, and made her serve them food and drinks.`
`He told her to walk on all fours like a real pet.`
`She refused, but she obeyed immediately when he tried to hit her.`
`Everyone was laughing, and they were all jealous of him.`
` Teppei felt really good about himself.`
`However, someone arrived to interrupt this perfect life.`
`"I'm a teacher from the Hinamizawa Branch School. My name is Chie!`
` Is Satoko Houjou-san here?"`
`He'd thought someone was at his door to sell insurance or something.`
`But it was a school teacher.`
`"Huh?`
` What the hell?`
` What do you want with Satoko?"`
`"I came here because she didn't come to school today. I wasn't able to get ahold of her, so I'm wondering what happened."`
`"Huh...?`
` School...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Is she home?`
` I need to talk with her."`
`"She's sick. That's right... she has a cold.`
` Satoko is resting because she has a fever..."`
`"I need to give her some handouts. May I please see her?"`
`"You idiot.`
` Weren't you listening to what I just said?`
` Satoko is sick!`
` She's sleeping right now!`
` I can't let you see her!"`
`This was going to cause him problems, Teppei realized.`
`Satoko was just a pet for him, and he had no intention of sending her to school.`
`But her teacher had shown up at his house just because she missed one day.`
` This wasn't good.`
`Teppei hates schools, and he really hates teachers.`
`"I see...`
` Do you think she can come to school tomorrow?"`
`"Who knows?`
` I won't know until tomorrow!`
` You idiot!"`
`"............I, I see.`
` All right...`
` Please tell her that I came by...`
` Thank you..."`
`He was able to get rid of the teacher, but it would create more problems if he didn't send Satoko to school tomorrow...`
`Teppei didn't need even more trouble on his place.`
`That meant he couldn't beat up Satoko like he wanted to.`
`Violence was the only way he knew how to communicate.`
` With that out of the picture, it was very difficult for him.`
`He wanted to beat up Satoko, but that would leave evidence on her body.`
`If that happened, he wouldn't be able to send her to school.`
`And if she didn't go to school, that teacher would show up at his doorstep again.`
` ......Shit.`
`On top of all that, the child consultation center paid a visit to his house that night.`
`...The teacher must have filed a report.`
`That bitch, Teppei thought. Next time I'll beat her in the face so hard she'll need plastic surgery!`
`Since Satoko was afraid of him, she pretended she really was sick when the social worker visited.`
`It was so easy for Teppei to control her.`
`He considered Satoko to be a convenient pet...`
` but at the same time, he'd need to be careful of the consultation center...`
`"...Aaah, fucking hell, this ain't gonna work at all!!"`
