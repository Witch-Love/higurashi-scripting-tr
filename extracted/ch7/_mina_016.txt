`I never thought I'd be chosen as one of the representatives.`
`I'm not a very good speaker, so really, Rena or Shion should have been picked instead of me.`
`......But I just couldn't refuse when they told me that Satoko's best friend should be the one to go...`
`They told us to sit on the couch inside the visitor's room.`
`The counselor, the manager, and the head of the office were there.`
` The way they treated us was improving every time we came.`
`I didn't know if today's appeal would change anything...`
` But I was starting to feel the direction of fate shift little by little.`
`"...What do you think, Rika?"`
`"Things have changed dramatically in only few days.`
` ...I have no idea what will happen next."`
`Hanyuu appeared beside me.`
` ...It had been a while since she showed up.`
`Hanyuu was assuming that we still wouldn't be able to save Satoko in this world either.`
`She always felt it was best to just watch what happened, without hoping for a positive change.`
`I'd been hurt so many times after being betrayed while hoping for change.`
`...Surely that wasn't good for my soul.`
`I've been beaten down over and over again.`
`It's better to be quiet and do nothing.`
`It's better not to expect change.`
`That way, if something bad happens, I won't feel pain.`
`......My fate was already a dead end.`
`But...... was that really true?`
`I did my best in many of my previous lives.`
`However, I had always acted alone.`
`A miracle only happens when everyone combines their efforts.`
`I was starting to feel the depth of what that meant.`
`But even so, that didn't guarantee that we could save Satoko.`
`This was the best chance I'd had so far, certainly...`
` but that still didn't prove anything.`
`I couldn't call it a miracle just yet.`
` A miracle is something far more dramatic.`
`So, this wasn't a miracle.`
`...It wasn't a miracle just yet.`
`There was still someone else who needed to reach out for this to become a miracle.`
`Everyone has been working so hard.`
`They truly believe they can bring about a miracle.`
`Who amongst them doesn't believe...?`
`Isn't there someone who's not reaching out her hand, like everyone else is doing...?`
`"...Basically, it's because of Satoko that a miracle won't occur.`
` Things won't change unless she starts seeking help herself."`
`"...I know,`
` but that isn't so easy for her..."`
`"Everyone is trying to save Satoko, but she's not reaching her hand out in return.`
` ...Before they even came here, they should have tried persuading her first."`
`"...You think we should tell her to reach out her hand?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I know that's not an easy thing for her...`
` but it wouldn't be as difficult as waiting for another world as fortunate as this one."`
`In any case, I'm the only one with the key to open her heart.`
`I'm like family to Satoko.`
`I know she thinks the same.`
`I'm not trying to brag or anything.`
`Satoko is like family to me as well.`
`...No, my feelings toward her are even deeper than that.`
`It might be only one year for Satoko, but I've spent decades with her.`
`"You know... I've just realized something. ...Heh, I know why this isn't yet a miracle."`
`"......Why is that?"`
`"For a miracle to happen, everyone must come together.`
` ...But someone is still missing.`
` One person is still not working with everyone.`
` That's why the miracle hasn't occurred."`
`"......Are you talking about Satoko?"`
`"Hee hee...`
` ...No.`
` It's me.`
` I'm talking about me."`
`I had just been observing them like a spectator.`
`I'd been tired of this eternally repeating world, and acted like a witch.`
` I had forgotten the powerful feelings needed to change fate.`
`In other words, it was like I was supposed to be an actress, but was just sitting back and eating popcorn.`
`...I'm not a spectator.`
`I'm one of the people on the stage.`
`And that's why this play was never successful.`
`In the world where Rena took over the school,`
`if I hadn't done anything, Keiichi would've died in an explosion.`
`Because I got on the stage like I was supposed to, the play didn't end that way.`
`I'm a part of this world too.`
`It's such an obvious thing, but I must have forgotten it a long time ago.`
`"I have to open up her heart.`
` ......I have to set her free from Satoshi.`
` I'm sure someone else can do that too, but I have the greatest chance of success. `
`If I don't get up on that stage again, a miracle is never going to happen."`
`"...........Rika.`
` You once did the same thing over and over again, and got hurt, remember?`
` Are you going to make the same mistake again?"`
`"I'm aware of that.`
` But I'll never end up in a world this fortunate again.`
` ...The cheap resolve to try hard again in the next world will just cause my efforts to reach a dead-end somewhere else. `
`...Far more easily, and in a more hopeless form than it will in this world."`
`"........."`
`"This is my last chance...`
` If this world doesn't work out...`
` Then I'm going to give up."`
`"...What?"`
`Hanyuu looked at me with surprise.`
`For us, the term "giving up" means a lot more than what it sounds like.`
`...It doesn't only mean that I will accept my fate.`
`It means that I will accept the dead end waiting for me,`
` in other words,`
` accept my death.`
`"A... au au au au au!!"`
`"...You know, regrets occur even when we haven't made an effort. You know?`
` I was blessed with such a fortunate world this time. `
`...I mean, I never thought her uncle would come back, but overall, this has been a very lucky life.`
` And with this wind at our backs, I think I've probably unfurled my sails as far as I can. `
`That's why I believe this time will be different, and I also think that if this doesn't work out, nothing will.`
` If that happens, I think I'll be able to finally give up."`
`"Au au au au... Don't say that...`
` Au au au......"`
`I'm the only person who can communicate with Hanyuu.`
`If I disappear, she will have to go on with her life all alone.`
`That's the last thing Hanyuu wants to happen.`
`Perhaps that's why Hanyuu says the things she does.`
`She doesn't want my lifespan to wither away by getting hurt emotionally.`
`"You see... I belong here, in this play.`
` You showed me how to enjoy watching it, but the play won't move on as long as I refuse to act.`
` Surely that's why it always results in a dead end."`
`"......Rika.`
` ...I'm sure that one day, you'll get another fortunate life where her uncle doesn't come back.`
` I'm sure that you'll roll an extra six next time."`
`"A fortunate world like this one, where Satoko's uncle doesn't come back...`
` You're right.`
` That really would be wonderful."`
`Still, trying to beat my fated death is another issue entirely.`
` That sounds wonderful, but it's still not guaranteed.`
`"Let's wait for another opportunity...`
` ...Please...`
` Au au...... Please don't say that you're going to give up after this world."`
`"...If I die, no one will ever hear you cry again.`
` All you'll ever be able to do is make people sense your presence by making noise."`
`"Au au au..."`
`"Well... I'm heading back to the stage.`
` I'm going to do what I can.`
` You're sick of repeating all this over and over again, aren't you?"`
`"I'd rather repeat everything than spend the rest of my life without you."`
`Apparently she thinks this time loop that's driving me mad is far better than having no one to talk to.`
`...But that's just how she feels.`
`"...I want to overcome fate and see what's waiting in the future too.`
` But it wouldn't mean anything if you weren't there with me..."`
`I'm sure that's similar to my own claim that there's no point in living past June 1983 if I'm the only one who does.`
`My ideal future is to survive past June 1983,`
` and let the happy times continue like always, without anyone missing.`
`Hanyuu feels the same way.`
` She doesn't want a world where I'm not by her side...`
`We're repeating this world... only because we wish to do so.`
`It wasn't just Hanyuu's power, it was one that we shared together.`
`Hanyuu wants to be with me, just like I want to build myself a happy future.`
`We both want the same thing.`
`But if I refused to repeat the world again, my long life would be over.`
`Yet, I never refused, no matter how sick and tired of it I was.`
`For over a hundred years, I kept believing that something good would happen eventually.`
`However, our power is weakening, and we can only go back a few weeks at most.`
`We have so little time left to try and change our fate...`
`If we kept it up... eventually we'd only be able to go back to the morning of the day I was going to die.`
` That'd be a dead end for sure.`
`I don't think a life this fortunate will ever come my way again.`
`If my time was unlimited, I'm sure that will eventually happen...`
` ...but I can't count on it happening in what time I do have left.`
`Hanyuu told me to wait for another chance because she doesn't want to see me lose myself, but...`
`she isn't feeling the time limit like I am.`
`"It's a nightmare to die over and over again...`
` Before I end up in that hell, I want to pull the curtain down with my own hands.`
` This is going to be my last world. `
`If this one doesn't work out, I'm not going to repeat it again."`
`"A... au au au au!!`
` Au au au au au!!"`
`Let me translate what she's trying to say.`
`This world is no different from any other world.`
`You're not going to win, so don't bet on this life.`
`Your lifespan is not as short as you think.`
`You should wait for your next opportunity in this endless June.`
`Stay with me until then... Stay with me and wait for the next chance...`
`"That's what you're trying to say, isn't it?"`
`"......Au au."`
`"Then why don't you just pray for us?`
` Pray that we can persuade the child consultation center and save Satoko.`
` Pray that I can defeat the fate of 1983. `
`If I overcome this fate, let's do all the things I promised I'd do.`
` Let's eat this year's watermelon while enjoying the evening breeze through the window.`
` What kind of fall are we going to have? `
`How much snow are we getting this winter?`
` Let's enjoy the weather. Let's enjoy all sorts of things we've never seen.`
` Let's watch the next episode of that TV show we like.`
` Let's enjoy our future together."`
`"...You always said we were going to work hard until that day came...`
` But... it's not fair for you to say that you're going to give up... when just this life doesn't work out..."`
`".........I'm sorry that I couldn't keep that promise."`
`"...Au......"`
`"I'm sure that we'll overcome this fate.`
` You'll be there with me, Hanyuu.`
` Let's look up at the blue sky when that happens. `
`I'm sure that the sky of the summer of 1983 is more beautiful than any sky we've ever seen."`
`I'm sure I'm going to make a miracle happen in this world.`
`God didn't design humans so they could redo their lives over and over again like me.`
`People usually only have one chance. Yet, they can still make miracles happen with effort.`
`They work so hard because they know that they'll never have a chance to do it over again.`
` That's why miracles occur.`
`But if I can't make one happen with all that, I just have to give up.`
`"I don't need another life.`
` I'm going to make a miracle happen in this one.`
` My friends taught me that.`
` They taught me that miracles can happen when everyone works together.`
` So it's going to happen. `
`We will make it happen.`
` We're going to have a wonderful future in this life."`
`"Rika...... Au au au au......."`
`Hanyuu disappeared, sobbing sadly.`
`She was no longer in my sight, but I could still talk to her.`
`"Hanyuu...`
` We're going to have a bright future in this world.`
` Just trust me.`
` If you would just give me your power, it might be easier to make a miracle happen."`
`This is the best possible stage I can hope for.`
`The actors on the stage and the audience before it can help each other.`
`If you wish, you, the audience, can change the story too.`
`......I've made my decision.`
` I'm going up on the stage.`
`I'm not going to complain anymore.`
`I'll do my best, just like Keiichi and my other friends.`
`I'm not going to make any more excuses.`
`I'm not going to wait for another fortunate world.`
` I have to do my best in this one.`
`I'm not talking about my decision to die after this world is over.`
`I'm just saying that people are meant to have only one chance to live.`
`That's why they work so hard.`
`Because I had so many chances to redo my life, I haven't been working hard enough.`
` I was never able to make a miracle happen.`
`In my previous life, Rena took over the school.`
`Because I got in her way, Keiichi made it in time to stop the explosion.`
`The story changed because I decided to get up on the stage.`
`Perhaps in my other lives before that...`
` I could've changed my situation if I worked hard enough without giving up.`
`But I kept giving up so easily, and eventually lost my interest in those worlds.`
`And so, a miracle never happened.`
`A miracle never happened because I was always relying on the fact that I'd have another chance.`
`......Hanyuu.`
` I hope you can understand.`
`Please.`
` Don't be sad, and work hard with me in this world.`
`I couldn't tell if she understood me.`
`I assertively spoke to the officials about how much danger Satoko is in.`
`Keiichi and Irie also made their appeals from the bottom of their hearts.`
`I had no idea how the child consultation center took what we said so passionately.`
` All I could do was pray...`
`"How was it, Kei-chan?"`
`"Well...`
` It felt like a repeat of yesterday.`
` We both went over the same things we talked about then."`
`"We're still not reaching them?`
` I guess they said they'd look at matters more carefully...?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` They said they would visit once a week, and make a decision one month from now..."`
`"They're going to leave her with her uncle for one whole month!?`
` How come they can't understand how much Satoko will be hurt in that time!!"`
`"Maebara-san clearly explained to them the danger she's facing.`
` I also told them about what happened to her last year.`
` However..."`
`"They're really not going to consider it an urgent case unless Satoko-chan seeks help herself...?"`
`"I don't mean to cut into your conversation...`
` But is it possible for you to get Satoko-chan to ask for help?"`
`"......He's said that he's going to destroy Satoshi-kun's room if she tries to leave him.`
` What a horrible thing to say."`
`"They're still not changing their minds?`
` Satoko can't even ask for help because she's being taken advantage of...!"`
`The purpose of a child consultation center is to protect children...!`
`I was starting to get angry the more I thought about it...`
`But as I thought about it some more, I realized that they were just trying to do their job.`
` It was just that our opinions differed about the degree of urgency.`
`"We told them to save Satoko-chan as soon as possible.`
` They told us that she should be the one asking for help.`
`Is there any way to resolve this...?`
` Is there any way to get an SOS from her...?"`
`"We spoke to them about it.`
` It seemed like they were listening closely to us..."`
`"But it also sounded like they're still not going to take any action..."`
`Damn it...`
` When the head of the office showed up, I thought I could change things today, but...`
`...Everything went the same as yesterday, and we still weren't able to persuade them.`
`However, I'm sure we're making progress.`
`It might seem like they're withstanding our blows at first glance, but they're feeling the weight behind them.`
`We're not going to give up just because it didn't work out today. We're going to fight until they get off their butts and save Satoko...!`
`"I told everyone that we're going to do this again tomorrow too.`
` But we might get less people next time..."`
`"This is really annoying...`
` We're working so hard, but this is all we can do?"`
`Damn it...`
` We can't give up yet...`
`We might have less people tomorrow, but we're not going to call off our fourth appeal.`
`"Even if no one comes,`
` I'm going.`
` I'm not going to give up until they agree to help Satoko-chan."`
`"Same here.`
` I'm never going to give up.`
` Thank you, Mion.`
` I'll take whoever comes.`
` I could see you guys from the window. Those banners must have looked really intimidating to them."`
`"Hahahaha. I'm glad I stayed up all night to make them."`
`"......Thank you for the sashes too, Irie."`
`"No problem.`
` I wish I could do more than this."`
`".........I'm going to get more involved.`
` I was about to give up on saving Satoko... but seeing Keiichi and Irie talking with the head of the office today made me feel motivated."`
`Rika-chan was always watching us from afar.`
`It made me a little happy to see Rika-chan getting more active in the whole movement.`
`I wonder what Rika-chan can do...`
`"......The next time I see Satoko... I'm going to persuade her to seek help...`
` I think I'm the only one who can do that..."`
`The same thing was on all our minds.`
`The issue will be resolved the moment Satoko seeks help.`
`But nobody can say that to her, because we all know that she's dealing with the memories of her brother.`
`Satoko.`
`...I know how you feel about Satoshi, but this is different.`
`Please ask the child consultation center to help you.`
`As long as you're seeking help, they're ready to save you anytime.`
`Don't be afraid that your uncle is going to destroy Satoshi's room.`
` ......Please ask for them to save you...`
`But without even knowing Satoshi's face, I could never say that to her.`
`The only person who can ask her to seek help is Rika-chan. She's been living with her for the past year, and she's like family.`
`"...That's true.`
` ...I told her today, but she didn't listen to me.`
` It's sad, but the only person who can really talk to Satoko-chan is Rika-chan..."`
`"......I wish I could talk to her too. ...But I agree.`
` Rika-chama is her best friend...`
` ...If she can't persuade her... no one can."`
`"If we can open Satoko-chan's heart...`
` I'm sure everything will resolve itself.`
` It might be the better approach, rather than going to the child consultation center like this."`
`"......That's not quite true.`
` ...Although Rena isn't wrong either.`
` We both have to reach out our hands.`
` Satoko needs to reach out her hand too.`
` I also have to do the same. `
`If everyone doesn't work together, a miracle is not going to happen.`
` I didn't work hard enough because I didn't believe we could do it.`
` So the miracle never happened.`
` So I'm going to make a greater effort. `
`So I'm sure Satoko will take my hand.`
` .........Au.`
` I can't really explain what I want to say...`
` I'm sorry..."`
`Rika-chan is usually a quiet girl, but she talks a lot every once in a while.`
`Just because she's quiet doesn't mean that she's not thinking about anything.`
`In fact, because she's quiet, she must have a lot inside her heart that she's never expressed.`
`We are going to continue our appeal to the consultation center.`
`Rika-chan is going to persuade Satoko.`
`This is the best approach, or at least the best one that I can think of.`
`It might be slow and quiet.`
`But now that I'm in the game, I can't quit until I win.`
`If I gave up, I'd lose everything that I bet on.`
`We're going to save Satoko...`
`We just have to work together.`
`But, obviously, we don't have much time left to fight...`
`What to do...?`
` We're definitely going to have less people tomorrow...`
`In other words, we can't intimidate the child consultation center any more than we did today.`
`I couldn't see any way to break our deadlock with the consultation center, so I had no choice but to swallow down the irritation starting to boil up in my chest and pretend not to notice it.`
`"It's getting pretty dark.`
` Mion-san, you should tell everyone to go home now.`
` I have a festival committee meeting tonight, so I have to head straight there after this."`
`"Ah, I need to go the meeting too!!`
`I almost forgot..."`
`That meant I had to go too.`
`While it wouldn't be a big deal if I missed the meeting, I should still go.`
`I don't understand most of the things they're even talking about there, but I don't want to be rude.`
` I'd have no choice but to go.`
`"I guess we need to wrap things up for today.`
` Otherwise, you're not going to make it in time for the meeting."`
`Mion thanked all the people who came today, and told them to meet at the same place at the same time tomorrow.`
`And with that, the third day of our desperate appeal was over.`
`"Hello?`
` It's me, Keiichi.`
` Yeah...`
` I'll eat when I get home.`
` I'm going straight to the assembly hall from here.`
` Dad is on his way, right...?`
` Okay. Got it..."`
`I called my mom and told her that I'd be going to the meeting without coming home.`
`I'd get there kind of early, but...`
`if I went home first I wouldn't make it in time.`
`Mion, Rika-chan and Irie were going to head there with me.`
`Shion said that she was also coming,`
` and now Rena didn't want to go home alone either.`
`"My dad won't be home until late tonight, so I'm coming too.`
`I hope that's all right with you guys. I hope."`
`"That's fine with us.`
`They'll be glad to see a bunch of young people there."`
`"......The average age will plummet."`
`"Ahahaha.`
` I want to say hi to Uncle Kimiyoshi too. I haven't seen him in a while."`
`We all headed toward the Furude Shrine in the dim light.`
`The light was on in the assembly building.`
`Some people had already arrived.`
`"Good evening.`
` You guys are early."`
`"Hello, Mion-chan and... her friends!`
` Good evening, Dr. Irie."`
`"Good evening.`
` You're here early."`
`"Ha ha ha ha. We don't have anything else to do."`
`More people started coming into the meeting hall.`
`Everyone seemed to come so early.`
` I should probably come earlier from now on too...`
`"I thought I saw a lot of fashionable shoes at the entrance today. There are lots of young people here!`
` Shion-chan! It's been so long.`
` What brought you here today?"`
`Everyone bowed to the newest arrival.`
`It was the mayor, Kimiyoshi-san.`
`He strode into the room with the other committee members.`
`"Hello. It's been a while.`
` I was hanging out with my Sis, and just happened to come along with them."`
`"Is that so?`
` Well, you're welcome here.`
` You're coming to the Watanagashi festival this year, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'm going this year for sure.`
` I want to see Kei-chan hosting the auction too!"`
`"Wa ha ha.`
` I guess it's time for young people like you to take over the festival.`
` By the way, I wanted to talk to you, Mion-chan...`
` Can you come this way...?"`
`"Fine, what is it?`
` Is that guy from the refreshment booth team still angry?"`
`"Ah, well... Ah ha ha ha..."`
`Mion headed outside with Kimiyoshi-san and the other committee members.`
`There's only one room in the building, so they have to go outside if they want to talk in private.`
`"Today is Thursday... so we have only three more days until the festival.`
` Are you ready for the auction?"`
`"There's not much that I can do now.`
` I'm ready to get up on the stage and do my thing, though."`
`"......I think Keiichi performs best under pressure."`
`Everyone laughed.`
`We continued to chat about the festival.`
` We talked about what kind of festival young people like us would want to see. That sort of stuff.`
`Suddenly, Mion tapped me on the shoulder.`
`"Kei-chan, I need you for a second..."`
`She gestured for me to follow her out front without letting the others know.`
` ......What did she want?`
`Once outside, I see Mion, Chie-sensei, and the principal.`
`"Oh, Chie-sensei, Mr. Principal...`
` Good evening."`
`Chie-sensei responded to my greeting, but the principal must not have heard me, since he didn't.`
`His eyes were closed. He seemed lost in thought.`
`That sight... caused our happy, chatty feelings to cool off quickly.`
`...My intuition told me this had to be about something bad.`
`"......I need to talk to you, Maebara-kun."`
`"That doesn't sound good..."`
`"........."`
`"Are you going to the child consultation center again tomorrow?"`
`"Yes.`
` We'll keep fighting until they save Satoko. That's our mission.`
` I don't know if we'll get as many supporters as we did today, but we're going back there again.`
` Right, Mion?"`
`"Maebara-kun...`
` I know you've already made plans for tomorrow, but after that... I think you should wait and see what they do..."`
`Thanks to the "advice" from Ooishi-san last night...`
` I already had an idea of the situation.`
`"Is this a warning... Chie-sensei?"`
`".........."`
`"...If our protest grows any bigger, the village officials will have to take notice of it.`
` That's why you're telling me to quit now, isn't it...?"`
`"Maebara-kun.... I think what you're doing is a good thing.`
` You're not wrong to pursue the things you believe in.`
` However......."`
`She stopped talking after that.`
`Chie-sensei was supporting us until just yesterday.`
`She even came to the child consultation center with us on the second day.`
`So for her to start saying completely the opposite...`
`I felt slightly dizzy from the shock of it.`
`"Kei-chan, let me explain in her stead.`
` Chie-sensei is still supporting us as an individual.`
`However`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` well..."`
`"Is she being pressured by the Board of Education or something?"`
`"......Chie-sensei will never bow to pressure.`
` You have no idea how courageous she is. `
`She ignored the Board of Education and came to this village when the Hinamizawa Branch School was still not approved by the government."`
`I think Mion told me about that story before.`
`The school was closed when the dam conflict happened.`
`However, the village children still came to the school to learn.`
`There were no teachers there, though, because the school wasn't officially operating.`
` ...That was when Chie-sensei arrived.`
`After they won the dam conflict, the Sonozaki family and other villagers made an appeal, and the school's existence was finally approved.`
`Our school did not have an easy start.`
`The government was against it, but the villagers forced them to approve.`
`Chie-sensei came along with us on our appeal yesterday.`
`That was very courageous of her, but...`
` now people who want to close the school are paying attention to what we're doing.`
`"...That's basically it.`
` ...Chie-sensei can't support us openly anymore."`
`Chie-sensei stared at the ground as Mion spoke.`
` ...I'd never seen her look so sad.`
`".........If it was just about me, I wouldn't care what happened.`
` I don't want to be a teacher who can't even fight for her own students.`
` ......But I can't put the whole school in jeopardy..."`
`I don't know who told her this.`
`Whoever it was, they warned her not to escalate things around Satoko's case.`
`They threatened the existence of our school to make her obey, and pressured her with responsibility she couldn't take on her own.`
`"...You know, yesterday, Ooishi-san told me something similar.`
` In this exact same spot, too. `
`...He warned me that if I kept escalating this, then I'd be fighting against the elders who still don't like the Houjou family.`
` Or something like that."`
`"......He told you that?`
` ......Well,`
` he's not really wrong."`
`Mion looked at the ground along with Chie-sensei.`
`I always thought Chie-sensei and Mion were stronger people.`
`So seeing them both hanging their heads like "this is hopeless," made me feel like we were being pushed into a dead-end, and I hated it.`
`"...You were just at the child consultation center with us!`
` You told everyone to come again tomorrow!`
` That's the Mion I came to this meeting with... so when did she get swapped with this weak Mion?!"`
`When I said, "When did she get swapped," I immediately thought of one thing.`
`...The mayor took her outside the building earlier...`
` Did he...?`
`"I see...`
` He called you out here to talk about this, didn't he?"`
`"...Well, kind of.`
` Ahahaha..."`
`It felt painful to see her fake a smile like that.`
`She was only out here with him for about ten minutes.`
`What the hell did he tell her that crushed her spirit...?`
`"Mion, Chie-sensei... The two of you are the strongest people I know. I respect you very much.`
` ...I can't even imagine what kind of pressure would cause you to change your opinions overnight."`
`I didn't feel like getting mad at them.`
`They were just as passionate about saving Satoko as I was.`
` Towards them, I felt nothing but...`
` pity.`
`"Maebara-kun...`
` I don't know what to say..."`
`"You don't need to apologize."`
`I could feel an angry tone entering my voice.`
` I'd had enough.`
`"Tell me something.`
` Why do the old people in the village still hate the Houjou family that much?`
` The dam conflict is over.`
` Satoko is totally innocent, isn't she?`
` Why do they still hate her so much?`
` Who hates her? `
`Whose fault is this?`
` I'm going to have a chat with whoever that is!"`
`".........I don't think anyone actually hates the Houjou family."`
`"What?`
` What are you saying?"`
`"...It's true that the Houjou family was the enemy during the dam conflict.`
` The whole village believed that.`
` But after Satoko's parents died, people started realizing that she was innocent.`
`......But no one ever came forward to forgive her...!"`
`"I can explain why."`
`"Shion...!"`
`It wasn't just Shion who appeared.`
`Rena and Rika-chan were there with her.`
`They'd come out to check on me, and overheard what we were talking about...`
`"After uniting to turn the Houjou family into their scapegoat, the village is still living in fear.`
` ...But not because they're scared of them. `
`...They're living in the fear that if they end up connected to the Houjou family, they'll be made a scapegoat by the village too."`
`In other words...... if you help a member of the Houjou family,`
` you might get attacked by the village, just like they did.`
`...They still feel that way, years after the conflict.`
`"Is, is that true?`
`Everyone was always nice to Satoko-chan at school!"`
`"Only the old people are involved in this...`
` However, they're the core of the village..."`
`"They all believe that the leader of the Sonozaki family, my Granny, still hates the Houjou family.`
`But that's not true.`
` Granny is also afraid. `
`She thinks that if she forgives the Houjou family, the other elderly people will lose trust in her."`
`"...This is really complicated.`
` So what do you mean?`
` Who am I supposed to punch in the face?!"`
`"The truth is...`
` No one really hates the Houjou family...!`
` They all think we should forgive them.`
` But they can't come forward with that opinion!`
` They're convinced that everyone else still hates the Houjou family!"`
`"So... everyone is misunderstanding each other...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` You can ask all of them individually.`
` You'll see that no one really hates Satoko.`
` Her parents' death marked the closure of that hatred. `
`After her parents died, my grandma told everyone not to bother the Houjou family anymore.`
` However, she didn't tell people to forgive them."`
`"......That's probably... because of my father."`
`"Rika-chan's father?`
` Why is that...?"`
`"......My father was so laid back that people started saying he didn't deserve to be a leader in the village anymore."`
`"Rika-chan's dad was a very relaxed guy...`
` I think that helped him calmly resolve things.`
` ...But at the time, people who were burning with anger about the dam project were looking for a more aggressive leader. `
`So my Granny came forward and acted as one, in order to unite the whole village..."`
`"And because of her role as an aggressive leader, she can't publicly announce that she's going to forgive the Houjou family...?"`
`"...Yeah...`
` Old people put a lot of stock into not changing their minds...`
` She can't reverse her policy so easily..."`
`"But that's terrible!!`
` People are refusing to forgive Satoko-chan, and then blaming it on everyone else!`
` They can't forgive her because they're afraid of what other people might think...? That's awful!!"`
`"During the dam project, a few households actually thought that it would be fine to vacate their homes, since they were getting compensation money from the government.`
` But they couldn't say that out loud... `
`The Houjou family, however, came forward with their opinion and announced that they were willing to vacate. `
`Those households gained courage after seeing the Houjou family, and they almost established a group of people who agreed to leave. `
`I'm sure you understand this after today, but in order to effectively protest something, everyone has to have the same opinion.`
` It's important that the whole village is on the same page.`
` Before the dam conflict, `
`Hinamizawa was tearing itself apart instead of waging war..."`
`"......They said that it was because my father was such a lazy leader...`
` He never thought that they'd actually build a dam.`
` He believed that we could reach a peaceful resolution just by negotiating. `
`People thought that was why some families started agreeing to leave."`
`"Supporters of the plan to evacuate... That sounds strange...`
` This is the first I've heard of that.`
` People in the village always said that they supported the dam project..."`
`She's right.`
`They usually claim that their enemies supported the project itself.`
`"......It sounds worse if you call them 'dam project supporters' than if you called them 'evacuation supporters,' doesn't it?`
`If you call them 'evacuation supporters', it makes it sound like they're peaceful people who don't want to fight.`
` But calling them 'dam project supporters' makes it sound..."`
`"I see...`
` It sounds more like a group of bad people trying to submerge the village under water..."`
`"It's all about appearances."`
`Coach had appeared.`
`He came outside after noticing how long we'd been gone.`
`"The village of Hinamizawa was brimming with a sense of unity.`
` ...Mr. Furude was not able to unite the village.`
` The Sonozaki family figured that they could seize power if they were to take charge of that unity."`
`"...I'm starting to understand now.`
` ...Let's phrase it a different way. `
`In order to unite the village, they attacked the Houjou family, who betrayed their sense of community. They used them to intimidate other people. `
`People became afraid of the Houjou family, so they changed their minds and started protesting against the dam project..."`
`"......They held that if you interacted with the Houjou family, you were probably a supporter of the dam project yourself.`
` That's why everyone kept their distance from them. `
`They acted like they didn't even see them. When someone from the family talked to them, they ignored it."`
`"Initially, they were targeting only Satoko-chan's parents. But eventually, the whole family was seen as a target.`
` As a result, her uncle and aunt were caught in the line of fire too.`
` It's kind of ironic. `
`That was the reason they started abusing Satoko-chan to begin with..."`
`Her uncle and aunt were not in support of the dam project, but because of Satoko's parents, they were also attacked.`
`After Satoko's parents died, they were forced to take care of their two children...`
`......It finally makes sense.`
` ...I can see the whole picture now...`
`"The dam conflict is over and Satoko-chan's parents are dead.`
` I think the Sonozaki family should speak out, and publicly forgive the Houjou family."`
`"But once again, there's an issue.`
` Granny is afraid that the elderly people here will lose their trust in her if she publicly forgives the Houjou family."`
`"...Seems like the Sonozaki family's as worried about people taking them lightly as the consultation center is."`
`"I heard this directly from her, so I'm sure that's what's happening.`
` All she could do was tell everyone not to bother the Houjou family anymore. `
`When she dies, she wants the next family head to officially declare the end of the dam conflict, and stop discriminating against the Houjou family.`
` ...My mom knows about this too."`
`"I heard about it from her, actually.`
` It's just that old hag's stubborn pride..."`
`"Let me ask you this.`
` It sounds to me like the mayor and his people threatened Mion and told Chie-sensei they'd close the school.`
` How about them?`
` Do they still have bitter feeling toward the Houjou family?"`
`"...It's ridiculous.`
` Even Uncle Kimiyoshi thinks no one in the village hates the Houjou family."`
`"It's just sad that the dam conflict hasn't completely ended for these people.`
` They're still afraid of being badmouthed behind their backs if they interact with the Houjou family."`
`"But people like you and Rika-chan interact with her."`
`"I'm young, and I don't have many ties to the town council either.`
` Plus, Rika-chan is special.`
` She's the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama..."`
`"Oyashiro-sama was the one who brought humans and demons together.`
` Which means..."`
`"She was able to live with Satoko, even though Satoko's not accepted by the villagers..."`
`After hearing all this, I'm beginning to understand how difficult it was for Satoko to live in this village.`
`She always acted bright and cheerful in school and in the club.`
`I thought that was her whole world.`
`But I had no idea how she felt when she was walking around alone in the village...`
`She probably went grocery shopping even knowing that people were going to ignore her.`
`She felt the coldness from them, but she was standing strong on her feet.`
`I had no idea she was going through something like that.`
`I knew she went through tough times during the dam conflict...`
` but I had no clue that she was struggling to this day.`
`"What a sad story...`
` And the whole thing is just nonsense, too."`
`"Do you feel that way too, Rena?`
` I feel exactly the same."`
`"No one feels bitter toward Satoko-chan, but everyone is afraid that something bad will happen to them if they interact with her!`
` Whose fault is this?`
` No one's?`
` Is the land or society making them think that way?!"`
`"It's no one's fault.`
` ...Yet they're so worried about everyone else's opinions they can't forgive her, huh."`
`"Yes...`
` That kind of atmosphere is great when the wind's blowing in a good direction.`
` People would act kindly and help each other.`
`But the case of the Houjou family... is totally the opposite. `
`It's spreading like a mold, and no one can do anything about it.`
` What do you do with a rotten tatami mat?`
` You have no choice but to toss it out and get a new one..."`
`"So the mayor is pressuring us not because he hates Satoko...`
` but because he thinks that if he lets us run free,`
` 'someone,' who doesn't even exist, might talk badly about him. So that's why he can't leave us be?"`
`"I call that 'someone' the 'curse of Oyashiro-sama'.`
` Everyone is afraid of that 'someone,' even though he doesn't exist.`
` But that 'someone' doesn't exist, and they're not a real person."`
`Shion's theory sounded interesting.`
`Everyone follows the rules because they're afraid of that someone.`
`However, even the leaders of the village are afraid of the same thing.`
`Everyone in the village is following the rules because they're afraid of someone who doesn't even exist.`
`They still follow the rules of dam conflict, thinking that they'll be cursed if they forgive Satoko.`
`Who the hell is that someone?`
`They could only call it the "curse of Oyashiro-sama".`
`Oyashiro-sama cursed the Houjou family because they supported the dam project.`
`They still believe that, and Satoko is struggling because of it.`
`"......Oyashiro-sama will not curse Satoko.`
` She thinks Satoko is adorable...`
` Please don't use her name for something horrible like that..."`
`Rika-chan made a sad face.`
`She's the shrine maiden for Oyashiro-sama, and the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`I don't think there's a curse in this village at all.`
`Everyone is just convinced that there is.`
`"...If that's the case...`
` This isn't the child consultation center's fault at all.`
` The whole village bears responsibility."`
`"Yes.`
` I think so too.`
` I thought appealing to the child consultation center would solve the problem, but that's not going to do anything."`
`"A rotten tatami mat, huh?`
` We can't just clean the surface...`
` Even if the consultation center does save Satoko, that's nothing but a temporary fix. `
`I guess we need to throw away the rotten tatami mat so we can save her for good."`
`"I think those tatami mats are all assembled nearby..."`
`"I agree.`
` Most of them are within a twenty meter radius of here."`
`"H-Hey, Kei-chan, Rena!`
` What are you guys going to do...?"`
`"Mion.`
` You're deeply involved in the village.`
` I know you feel hesitant to save Satoko, as one of the leaders here.`
` I understand why you and Chie-sensei almost gave up under the pressure... `
`But I have nothing to lose...!"`
`".........Maebara-san.`
` ...Are you really going to...?`
` Right here...?"`
`"I'm going to do it.`
` I'm going to get rid of that rotten tatami mat...!`
` Will you join me, Rena?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'm tougher than you think!"`
`"Heh heh, I know.`
` But you should settle down just a little bit.`
` ...I feel like you could blow up a school if you got too serious."`
`"Ahahaha. I think you could beat up someone with a metal bat if you got too serious!"`
`"Ah ha ha ha ha.`
` We're both pretty tough, huh?`
` Welp, let's go."`
`"Yeah, let's go."`
`"I understand your position, Mion.`
` You don't have to come with me.`
` Just leave if you think things are going to get out of control.`
` This is more dangerous than any club activity.`
` I'm damn serious about this!"`
`"..........."`
`As the next head of her family, she shouldn't agree with me, but she stared in silent approval of what I was about to do.`
`"......Okay.`
` ...If you're going to take that risk...`
` then I'm coming with you too."`
`"Heh heh, that's the way!`
` Just watch how I'll take care of this!"`
`"What about you, Shii-chan?"`
`"Fortunately, I have nothing to lose.`
` I'll support you guys."`
`"Chie-sensei, Mr. Principal, I understand your stance.`
` We're not in school right now.`
` Please forgive what we're about to do now."`
`"......You're right.`
` I'm not your teacher right now.`
`The principal and I... will entrust our will to you!"`
`"I'm supporting you guys too.`
` If they want me out of the village, I'm willing to close down my clinic.`
`It's only natural for a master to sacrifice everything to save his future maid!"`
`Oooooooooooh, I can feel everyone's power flowing into me...`
`I'm not even going to try and cool down.`
` I need to be fired up for something like this.`
`As I turned back, I noticed Ooishi-san and my dad.`
`I didn't know how long they'd been standing there.`
`"......Nfu fu fu.`
` You seem excited about something, Maebara-san."`
`"Ooishi-san.`
` You told me last night`
` that there are some things that a man can't give up on.`
` We have to take a chance, even when it's risky!!"`
`"Keiichi."`
`"Don't stop me, dad.`
` I know it's important to be polite... But I need to do this for my friend..."`
`"I'm not going to stop you."`
`"Huh?"`
`He gave me a big smile.`
`I've never seen my dad smile like that before.`
`"I believe in what you just told Ooishi-san.`
` There are some things that a man should not give up on.`
` You'll encounter something like that in your life sooner or later. `
`If this is that time, then I'm not going to stop you."`
`"...Hauu... Keiichi-kun's father is so cool."`
`"Of course. He's my dad!`
` He's at least half as cool as me!"`
`"I'm not from Hinamizawa.`
` I can't take either side... but I'll be watching you closely, Maebara-san.`
`'When it's make or break the game, take the risk and discard for the middle wait!' ...is something my old friend used to say.`
`You can't compromise once you make a decision.`
` If you're going to forfeit, do so immediately. But if you're going to fight, be confident in yourself."`
`"Mahjong uses double-double scoring, after all.`
` Even if you get a small amount of points several times in succession, you'll lose if someone scores a lot of points all at once. `
`You just have to be confident when you're ready to fight."`
`"Do you play mahjong too, Maebara-san...?"`
`They start talking about mahjong together.`
`Heh heh heh heh... This is going to be interesting...`
`Someone from the committee came out and told us to come inside for the meeting.`
`It was time for it to start.`
`"All right.`
` Let's go inside.`
` I feel like we're finally getting up on the stage!"`
`"No wonder we felt something was missing at the child consultation center."`
`"Yeah...`
` This was supposed to be the stage all along.`
` We were fighting with the wrong people for the past three days...`
` Let's go."`
`Someone pulled my shirt.`
` ...It was Rika-chan.`
`"......Keiichi..."`
`"You're not only Satoko's best friend, but you're also a member of the village's Three Families.`
` You can just watch what Rena and I are going to do.`
` But if you're willing to help us save Satoko... I want you to support us..."`
`"......You're going to try and change those hard-headed men...?"`
`"I'm going to change them!`
` I told you before.`
` Fate is thinner than a piece of paper!`
` I'll tear it down with ease!"`
`"......Au au... What is going to happen...?"`
`"They're calling the traditions of the village the 'curse of Oyashiro-sama'...`
` Shion sure has an interesting theory...`
` Is Keiichi going to smash it in two...?`
` Can he destroy the 'curse of Oyashiro-sama'...?"`
`He will break it. Keiichi has the power to break everything.`
`It's not just Keiichi's power, though.`
`Because everyone is working together, Keiichi is able to break anything.`
`This energy is more powerful than the lucky six on the die.`
`"......It's not luck.`
` He's destroying fate with his own two hands..."`
`Everyone followed Keiichi and entered the assembly hall.`
` ...I followed in after them.`
`I'm going to do this.`
` I'm going to do this with Keiichi.`
`If this doesn't work out, that's it for me.`
` I'm going to give it my very best...!`
