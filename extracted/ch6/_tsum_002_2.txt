`I quickly changed and ran to the front door. Rena was chatting with my parents.`
`...I always feel uncomfortable when my parents talk to my friends.`
`I'm afraid they'll say something embarrassing about me.`
`If they told Rena that I wet my bed till I was X years old or something,`
` she wouldn't wait until Monday to tell everybody in my school, or maybe even everybody in Hinamizawa!`
`"Hey, Rena!`
` Good morning.`
` I'm sorry for making you wait."`
`"Keiichi-ku~n, ahahahahahahaha."`
`Rena and my parents looked at me and laughed.`
`I said good morning and they laughed...`
`...I guess I was too late.`
`My parents must have already told Rena some embarrassing secrets about me.`
`I don't want my parents to tell her anything else, so I put on my shoes in a rush and pushed Rena out of the house.`
`My parents waved at us, smiling.`
`"Have a nice day.`
` Rena-chan, please take care of Keiichi!"`
`"Hauu!`
`Don't worry!!`
`I'll take good care of Keiichi-kun!"`
`"I have no idea why you'd have to do that. I don't need you to take care of me!"`
`I dragged Rena away from the house, and we were on our way.`
`We rode our bicycles to the town of Okinomiya. It's a long way away.`
`It's an easy ride to the town because it's mostly downhill...`
`But needless to say, it's a hard ride on the way back.`
`I felt like Rena was giggling whenever she looked at me...`
`I badly wanted to know what kind of embarrassing information my parents had fed her before I came downstairs...`
`I tried to give her a new subject to talk about in order to get whatever she heard from my parents out of her mind.`
`"How come you're so close to my folks?"`
`"Well,`
` we are very close`
` because we talk a lot."`
`"When do you talk to my parents?`
` I've never seen you having a conversation."`
`"I see your mother a lot at the grocery store.`
` She's there a lot on special bargain and extra point days."`
`"Ohh, yeah, my mom keeps a close eye on those.`
` She sticks notes like that on the refrigerator.`
` They're always all about when and where she can get things cheaper."`
`"Whenever I see her at the store, we talk about what we're making for dinner that night and we do the shopping together. `
`A few days ago, she told me that curry sauce was on sale and that she was going to have curry and rice for dinner that night, so I did the same!"`
`"I remember we had curry and rice the day before yesterday.`
` So, you had curry and rice that day too, huh?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You had pork curry, didn't you?`
` Pork was on sale that day, so your mom and I both bought some.`
` So, when I was eating my curry at home, I knew you were having the same dinner.`
` Hauuâ˜†."`
`...So she knows what I'm eating for dinner almost every day...`
`It didn't bother me, but I did kind of feel embarrassed.`
`"I usually see your father with your mother at the grocery store.`
` Your parents get along very well, huh?"`
`"Yeah, they like to go grocery shopping together.`
` ...I think they're a good couple, for their age."`
`"I think it's very important that your parents get along well.`
` It's cute that they still go grocery shopping together."`
`"That's enough about my parents.`
` What about yours, Rena?`
` Do they get along well?"`
`"Yes.`
` They do.`
` They're always hugging and kissing.`
` ...So, hauu...`
` I feel like there's no room for me in the house."`
`Her parents are a lovey-dovey couple, huh?`
`...I've never met Rena's mother, but I imagine she's just like Rena.`
`I could easily imagine her mother going crazy about the spot her husband missed when shaving, because it looks so cute to her, like sesame seeds on white rice.`
`...She must love to touch her husband's chubby stomach because it feels so soft.`
`It was funny how easily I could imagine her mother doing those things.`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha ha!"`
`"What's so funny...?"`
`"I'm curious about your mother now.`
` I'm going to go to your house next time and meet your mother!!"`
`"What?!`
` No! No, no, no!!"`
`"You talk to my mother.`
` It's only fair that I talk to yours too, isn't it?"`
`"Hau, but my mom isn't as interesting a person as you think...`
` She's normal and boring."`
`"I can even picture how she looks!`
` I know it!`
` She looks just like you, doesn't she?"`
`"What? What?!`
` No, she doesn't!`
` She doesn't look like me at all!"`
`"...Then, why are you acting so weird? Your reaction tells me everything.`
` Anyway!!`
` I'm really interested in your mother now!!`
` I'm going to see her sometime. Be prepared!"`
`"Hauu... No no no way!`
` If you really do come to my house, I'll be so mad at you!"`
`"Your daughter has been a great friend to me...`
` No, wait. It'll be more fun if I say something like,`
` 'I've been seeing your daughter, and I'm serious about her.'`
` Aha ha ha ha ha!"`
`"...Hauu...`
` If you come to my house... I'll tell Mii-chan and the others the stories from when you were little, little..."`
`"What? ...What kind of stories are you talking about exactly?"`
`"Well... the one that I heard from your mother is`
` about when you were four years old.`
` And the other one is about the slide when you were six years old, and`
` ...and another one is about when you were..."`
`"You got me, Rena-san.`
` I'll never get within a 100m radius of your house as long as you live."`
`"Ahahahahahahaha! Thank you!"`
`Dammit, Mom!`
` I'll remember this!!`
`We arrived at the station. The place we were going today is right near there.`
`It's a restaurant called Angel Mort. We were meeting up with the others there.`
`I was surprised when I saw the restaurant.`
`It's usually a normal and quiet restaurant... but today, there were many people in front of it.`
`They didn't look like they were waiting in line to get inside. It looked more like they were just loitering around.`
`They should just line up and go inside like normal people.`
`"Wow! What's going on?`
` There are so many people here!"`
`"The restaurant has a big event today.`
` I heard that many people are coming from far away."`
`There's a flag saying 'Dessert Festa' in front of the restaurant.`
`I heard that Angel Mort holds events like this several times a year, and a lot of people come to attend from all over.`
`"Today, only people who have a ticket can get into the restaurant.`
` And one ticket allows up to four people to get in."`
`"I see. So, these people are waiting for friends who have a ticket."`
`"Not exactly.`
` Some people have tickets but don't have four people to go with."`
`"...So you're saying that`
` these people are just here to find someone who'd like to share their empty seats?"`
`At that time, the crowd of people roared in excitement.`
` What was going on?`
`"This guy has a ticket!!"`
`"He's trying to get inside alone when he can bring three more with him!! How rude!!`
` Please let me join you!!!"`
`"I-If you let me join you, I'll honor you with a rare Angel Mort trading card!!" `
`"I'd come with Front Field's newest Summerket issue and its Limited Edition book!!!" `
`"I'll give you the beta version of Higurashi with a mode that lets you change everyone's outfits!" `
`"Make a deal with me for a modded version of G's figure!!" `
`"I... I'll give you 10,000 yen in real money!!"`
`"YOU FOOL!!!`
` RMT is prohibited!`
` Report!`
` Report!`
` Account,`
` BANNED!!"`
`"...I have no idea what they're talking about..."`
`"...Ahahahahaha.`
` The fans of this restaurant are a little scary, huh...?"`
`"Anyway, what about our ticket...?`
` There are five of us.`
` How are we all going to get in?"`
`"Shhhh!`
`...You know, Mii-chan's family owns this restaurant.`
` ...So, you know!"`
`"Mion is so cool sometimes..."`
`Rena makes a fist and gets all fired up.`
`"Well... Let's go!`
` We're going to dash through the crowd without stopping!"`
`"That seems like the best course of action, actually.`
` ...Okay."`
`We nodded at each other.`
`Since we were a group of two at present,`
` it looked like we had two more seats to share.`
` These people might try mobbing us in order to get a share...!`
`We crouched down, getting ready to run.`
`The crowd of people seemed to notice us.`
`"Look!!`
` Look at them! They're going to force their way through!!"`
`"And he's trying to fill a booth alone with his girlfriend! How reprehensible!!"`
`"We're going to sit with them and crush their lovey-dovey mood!!"`
`"Fight back to the last round!`
`Show them the iron will of the Germans!!"`
`Damn. They were going to tackle us!`
` They'd do whatever it took to stop us from getting inside the restaurant!!`
`"Today is the day Mii-chan and the others suffer their punishment!`
`If we can't get inside, our victory yesterday will have been in vain."`
`"I can't let that happen.`
` We exhausted ourselves to obtain that victory.`
` To watch our friends undergo the punishment is our right and..."`
`"Our duty as well!!"`
`"...But, no matter how cool we sound, what we're really after is one thing..."`
`"Hauuuu!!`
` I can't wait to see how Satoko-chan and Rika-chan look!!`
`I'm taking them home with me!!"`
`"Hey you, young couple!!`
` Share your empty seats with us, all nice and quiet-like!!"`
`"Hya hya hya!`
` We won't let you go through!!"`
`"I won't allow you to use your ticket for yourselves!!`
` You have to share the empty seats with us!!"`
`They reached their hands towards us like zombies!`
`They gradually got closer and closer...!`
`We were actually taking it easy, though.`
`In fact, I'd say the situation was rather enjoyable.`
`"Aha ha ha ha. It's like we're still in the middle of the game we played yesterday."`
`"Yeah, it's getting fun!`
` Let's kick their asses!!"`
`"Yep, roger that.`
` It's a lot easier to fight against them than against Mii-chan and Satoko-chan, you know? You know?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I'd say with even 20 to 30 of them... It's still easier than fighting against the other club members.`
` They don't have enough people to stop us!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Great! Let's do this!"`
`"Yeah!!"`
`Our enemies number about 20 to 30!`
`If they wanted to stop us, they should've gotten ten times more people than that!!`
`Ohhhhryaaahhh!!!`
