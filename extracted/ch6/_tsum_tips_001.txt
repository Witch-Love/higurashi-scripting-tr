`One reason I like my house is because it has good ventilation.`
`As long as there's a nice breeze, I don't have to rely on a fan to keep me cool.`
`I can take down my futon from the windowsill, place my cushion near the open window, and enjoy the cool breeze of the evening.`
`According to my page-a-day calendar, it's June, 1983 today.`
`While it was still June, it seemed like summer skipped the rainy season and was already coming around the corner.`
` ...This was very abnormal, apparently.`
`Even if it was abnormal weather that only comes around once in a hundred years, if it was supposed to come in June of 1983, then it wasn't so much of a big deal.`
`It was inevitable.`
`On the other hand, the sudden evening shower on the way home from school was more unpredictable than anything else.`
`Every day had been in perfect harmony, as if it was all carefully planned.`
`I felt like something good was going to happen this year.`
`...How should I put it...`
`It's like the feeling I get when I roll a six on the first throw of a board game and start off with a huge lead.`
`When it comes to a die, the more you roll it, the more the total averages out.`
`We actually roll a die many times every day of our lives.`
`So, it's not like one stroke of luck is really a big deal to be overly happy with.`
`...If I roll a six on my first throw and a one on the next throw, the total is seven.`
`If you believe in fate, you might say there's a higher possibility of a one to come up on the die.`
`But you can never actually tell what number you will roll.`
` That's what fate is all about.`
`...You might roll a six again.`
`The chance of rolling a six twice in a row is one out of thirty-six... but if you look at each throw one by one, there's only a one-sixth chance of that miracle.`
`The glass wind chime Satoko put up yesterday was making a refreshing sound...`
