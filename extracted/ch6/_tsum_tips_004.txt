`I opened the window, placed my cushion nearby, and prepared to enjoy the weather.`
`...But she came over and disrupted my peaceful evening.`
`She always ruins my time of solitude.`
`"...You look pleased.`
` Oh, that's right. You ate lots of your favorite sweets today."`
`This girl loves sweets more than anything.`
`...I like them too, but I can't eat like she does. It'd give me heartburn if I ate the amount she ate today.`
`She seemed to be very happy, so I'll leave her alone for a while.`
`I'd been making my favorite hot and salty food for the past few days, so she must be quite pleased today.`
`It was a very fun day for me, too.`
`I just wanted to enjoy the memory of the excitement I felt today by sitting here quietly, enjoying the sunset.`
`But when I looked up at the sky, I saw some thick clouds forming there.`
`...The wind was a bit cooler than usual.`
`It might start raining soon.`
`"......People say that when deep-sea animals come up to the shallows`
` it's a sign of a big earthquake or a tsunami."`
`We saw a very rare fish that dwells in deep water in the shallows today.`
`Just as the ancient stories of sea monsters say, people hate deep-sea animals and tend to interpret them as omens of a disaster.`
`It didn't matter if they showed up alive or dead.`
`Ah, I said something interesting just now.`
`Even if they showed up alive or dead,`
` it was an omen of a disaster.`
`Oh... It might start raining soon.`
`"...Yeah, yeah, I know. You don't have to tell me.`
` I'll get the laundry."`
`I grabbed a basket and went outside to take the laundry in.`
`The clouds were getting darker.`
`I normally like rain... but I didn't think I'd enjoy it today.`
