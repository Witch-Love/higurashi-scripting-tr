`...The chorus of the higurashi had replaced that of the cicadas.`
`Their cries came from a distance, echoed loudly, and then faded away. They sounded so weak and fragile.`
`Rena's voice was just like the cries of the higurashi. She'd say something, but the words would quickly fade away.`
`...She sounded so fragile that it made me worry she might vanish into thin air along with her words.`
`But nobody is pressuring her to continue.`
`Mion dusted off the hood of an abandoned car, and sat down on it as if to show how relaxed she was.`
`She actually did look very relaxed, as if she came here to enjoy the cool breeze of the evening or something.`
`Satoko followed Mion's example and sat down as well.`
`She didn't look nearly as relaxed, however.`
`I thought about following suit, but it felt rude to look away from Rena even for the short time it would take to look for a place to sit down. So, I decided to remain standing.`
`Rika-chan didn't sit down, either.`
`But she wasn't looking at Rena.`
`Everybody else was looking at Rena,`
` but Rika-chan...`
` was looking at the red sky.`
`Rika-chan's expression was hard to describe...`
`She looked pale and blank at the same time, as if all of her emotions were gone.`
`Rena wore the same kind of expression.`
`She kept trying to say something, but it seemed like the words were stuck in her throat.`
`...She noticed Rika-chan was looking at the sky, so she decided to look that way as well.`
`Mion did the same.`
`...So did I.`
`Satoko looked that way too.`
`          And with that, there was silence.`
`It was like we were in a concert hall, filled with the chorus of the higurashi. A concert hall with the highest roof in the world.`
`...A refreshingly cool breeze tickled our sweaty bodies.`
`I could almost make myself believe we came here to enjoy the breeze and the sunset...`
`I could only wish`
` that was what we came here for...`
`The shadows of the birds flying across the sky soured the feeling of our quiet concert.`
`...They reminded us that time hadn't stopped.`
`Nobody wanted to pressure Rena.`
`We didn't want time to pressure her, either.`
`We wanted to keep the cool red sky as long as we could, so Rena could calm down and talk.`
`Right then,`
` I heard a sound, and it brought us all back to reality.`
`...The hood Mion was sitting on had made a noise when she moved to cross her legs.`
`I don't know whether Mion made the noise on purpose or not`
` ...but it reminded us that time had been passing by.`
`The noise took our attention away from the sky and back to the ground.`
`Such a tasteless noise seemed to have urged Rena to speak.`
`Rena heaved a small sigh, nodded as if she understood something, and looked at us like she always did.`
`"...There's one thing I want to say...`
` before anything else."`
`She was probably saying it to everybody. But since I'm standing in the middle, with her looking at me... I nodded to her to represent our agreement.`
`"...I think I did the right thing."`
`Her voice wasn't hoarse anymore.`
`She sounded just like she always did.`
`"I wonder how much we're allowed to struggle in order to be happy..."`
`It sounded like a question, but nobody answered.`
`"That's why`
` I really like Mii-chan's club.`
` ...The one rule is to do whatever it takes to win, right?`
` I think that's wonderful. `
`...If we were only allowed to do nice things, and if there was a limit to how much we could struggle... people who aren't happy wouldn't be able to seize happiness at all.`
`Misfortunes are like a chain reaction, I think.`
` Once they begin, they're very, very hard to escape.`
` In order to escape the chain of misfortunes, you need more than just luck or even assistance.`
`I think you need to struggle as hard as you possibly can.`
` You need to do your best.`
` That's how you seize true happiness. That's what I believe."`
`Rena stopped talking, looked up, heaved a sigh, and opened her mouth again.`
`"But... I'm not saying that I expect you to accept what I did.`
`...I know that was a very bad thing to do.`
` Didn't you all look stunned a while ago?`
` That tells me everything..."`
`I've never seen her smile so... self-derisively like this.`
`That smile looked unbelievably painful.`
`...I could really feel how huge the distance between us was.`
`There's nothing physically there, but... I felt as if she's talking to us through iron bars or a chain-link fence. That's how great`
` the distance between us was.`
`"...But, it's okay.`
` There's nothing we can do about it.`
` That's just how things are in this world.`
`If I were you... I'd probably look just as stunned, and I'd say something irresponsible and merciless."`
`She probably... said that to hit back at us.`
`We're just putting on a mask of sympathy, enjoying the spectacle of a clown on a stage. That's why she said that.`
`She probably expected us to say something in return.`
`...But none of us knew what to say.`
`Rena looked disappointed for a moment, then turned and clambered on top of an abandoned car.`
`Then she spread her arms out and gave a little twirl, letting her skirt billow up before she grabbed both ends and gave us a graceful curtsy.`
`"Well then... are you ready for a story?`
` This is the story of how Rena Ryuugu did her best."`
`There was no curtain or spotlight.`
`She was atop an abandoned car amidst the trash piles, a stage specially made for her.`
`We tried not to miss a word of what she was about to say.`
`We believed that was the least we could do to not hurt her feelings.`
