`I finished talking with Ooishi on the phone, and soon left the phone booth.`
`...I realized something, and a chill ran through my body.`
`I was in a phone booth that stood out tremendously in the dark.`
`Somebody must've seen me.`
`I was certain`
` I was being <i>watched</i>.`
`I saw glowing eyes staring at me in the dark...`
`......It wasn't human.`
`Was it an illusion?`
` No.`
` I knew who they were.`
`...They were the ones controlling the Three Families who ruled Hinamizawa.`
`Its eye level was too low for it to be human... and its outline was vague.`
`...I knew from the past records that they were physically frail.`
`The silhouette, which indicated its inhuman appearance, was unbelievably unrealistic.`
`...Especially its protruding head.`
`...One of the scrapbooks I received from Miyo-san described their appearance in detail.`
`...Their eyeballs were pure red, like blood...`
` and their bodies smell like ammonia.`
` ...Even though some of them have, at times, been captured around the world...`
` all of them melted or disappeared, leaving no trace behind.`
`...The only traces remaining are the marks proving their descent to Earth...`
`Right then, the impossible unrealistic silhouette took a step closer...`
` and got closer and closer towards me...`
` making a realistic noise as it crunched across the gravel.`
`The noise pulled me back to reality.`
`"D-Don't come closer... you monster!!"`
`It kept walking towards me!!`
`It sounded like it was kicking pebbles everywhere as it walked.`
`It was coming closer and closer.`
`...I was scared, so I said the same thing once again.`
`And this time, the glass door of the phone booth I was just in started to rattle and shake!`
` Bang!`
` It made weird sounds as if being struck by something.`
`I screamed loudly in fear and started running.`
`I ran so hard that it felt like my lungs were about to explode. And then, I looked back... to find that the thing was no longer chasing after me.`
`......Was it my imagination...?`
`There's no way it was just my imagination. I definitely heard the sound of the gravel being kicked and the phone booth rattling!!`
`But I needed to calm down...!`
`...Right then, I needed to make my heart stop beating so fast.`
`...I'd have to fight them eventually.`
`...The next time they appeared, I was going to strike back at them...`
` I was going to squash their heads with my big hatchet...!`
`I'd protect Hinamizawa. It was my duty to do so.`
` I wouldn't allow them to do whatever they wanted...!!`
`I saw the lights flickering in my head again...`
