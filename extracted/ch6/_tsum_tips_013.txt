`"......Tomorrow... is the day."`
`"Hmm?`
` ............Oh, you mean the day we die?"`
`"......It's going to end up the same way this time, just like the last time."`
`"I don't know about that.`
` ...It's been very similar to the last one, but there were some things that were different, too.`
` ...Keiichi remembered what happened."`
`"...That's impossible.`
` There's no way he could remember. I mean, there's no way he could <i>know</i>."`
`"Hee hee hee...`
` The more you say that it's absolutely impossible... the more it makes me feel like this is a real miracle."`
`"There's nothing we can do. It's going to end up the same way again."`
`"I'm not sure about that."`
`"Yes, it will.`
` Everything will be over...`
` when the higurashi cry."`
`...Was it all going to end anyway?`
`The more often you throw a die, the closer the total will get to the average.`
`When you throw a die 100 times, even if a miracle happens and you get a six twice or three times in a row, the total will average out in the end.`
`...That's a fact of statistics.`
`But when you throw a die 100 times, the total number ranges from 100 to 600.`
`The more you throw, the greater the likelihood that the number will converge, on the average.`
` But the truth is, the more you throw, the more possible outcomes you create.`
`There are 500 different futures you can create by throwing a die 100 times.`
`There are 5,000 different futures you can create by throwing a die 1,000 times.`
`There might be one future among them that enables you to actually finish this never-ending game of dice.`
`...Keiichi showed me a miracle, and it taught me that it's not a waste of effort to keep throwing the die.`
`Don't give in to something like an average.`
`"..............."`
`"............You think we'll never have a different ending, don't you?`
` I can tell, because it's written all over your face."`
`"..............."`
`"...I think so, too... I think we're going to have the same ending this time again.`
` ...But I'm not going to give up hope until I throw the die for the last time.`
` Keiichi taught me that. `
`Something is going to be different this time.`
` ...I'll try to believe in that."`
`"......Rika... you're a very strong person."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` That's because I'm a lot younger than you."`
`"......Mmm...`
` Yawn.........`
` Rika...?"`
`"...Meep."`
`"Why are you still awake...?`
` ...Yawn...`
` It's not good to stay up so late..."`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I couldn't sleep, so I was just looking at the stars.`
` I'm going to bed now."`
`"Please do...`
` Good night, Rika......"`
`"...Good night, Satoko."`
