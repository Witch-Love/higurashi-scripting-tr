`"You don't need to get remarried."`
`That was the first thing I said after I got home. My father looked stunned.`
`He noticed the sad tone in my voice, and realizing that I didn't agree with the idea of his remarriage, he looked down.`
`"......I understand.`
` ...I know how you feel, Reina.`
` I should've talked about it with you first and..."`
`"That woman is lying to you about her pregnancy."`
`"Don't talk like that.`
` Rina-san is..."`
`"I'll tell you the truth.`
` That woman and a guy called 'Tecchan' are a team of bad people.`
` She went out with you only because she was trying to get our money."`
`My father didn't get it right away, of course. He looked upset instead because I called her "that woman".`
`I should've chosen my words a little more carefully, but I think I told him the truth clearly enough.`
`I told him everything I heard and saw at the coffee house.`
`...As I expected, he defended Rina anyway.`
`I was upset, but at the same time, it made me certain that there was no other way than to kill her. I felt the pressure on my shoulders lessen for some reason.`
`My father thought he needed my approval for his remarriage, so he held back his anger and put a fake smile on his face instead.`
`"Hey, Reina... Let's sit down with a cup of tea and talk.`
` I'm sure you'll understand once you hear me out."`
`...A tamed animal`
` is still tamed`
` even after the owner is dead.`
`That's okay.`
` I'll open the gate anyway.`
`...Even a tamed animal will notice one day that he's no longer in captivity.`
`That's not something that I could teach him.`
` He had to realize it on his own.`
`I couldn't stand his fake smile anymore, so I left the living room.`
`Time healed the pain from the divorce.`
`...Time heals any kind of pain, just like how dripping water will eventually bore a hole through solid rock.`
`I did what I could do.`
` Now, I'd have to wait.`
`But the day I was going to wait for came earlier than I expected.`
`At midnight of the following day,`
` we had a visitor.`
`It was that "Tecchan" man.`
`Teppei Houjou.`
`Teppei didn't even knock on the door to get in. He broke into the house by smashing the window.`
`At first, I thought he came here to ask us about Rina's whereabouts, but I was wrong.`
`The real reason why Teppei came here was because... it was their plan.`
`It was the last stage of their badger game.`
`Rina was probably supposed to be in bed with my father at that time tonight.`
`Teppei must've wanted to show up and catch them sleeping together.`
`Teppei looked around the house, but he couldn't find Rina.`
`He didn't change the plan, though. He grabbed my father by his collar and started yelling threats.`
`He showed my father a certificate of marriage to Rina, and shouted at him saying, "you got my wife pregnant! How are you going to take responsibility?"`
`My father had no idea she was married. He looked shocked.`
`My father is a short guy who is faint of heart.`
`He just let Teppei do and say whatever he wanted from beginning to end.`
`I looked at them from a distance coldly.`
`...The more Teppei yelled and threatened my father, the faster he'd wake up from his bad dream.`
`This was a medicine for him.`
`Teppei was cutting out the cancer that I was going to depend on time to do, and he was doing a great job of it.`
`I waited to help my father until I was sure that he had finally awakened from his bad dream.`
`I told Teppei that I had something very important to tell him and took him outside.`
`"So,`
` whaddya want?"`
`"Has Rina-san...`
` come back to Okinomiya`
` since yesterday?"`
`"......Nnn?"`
`"As a matter of fact... she's hiding somewhere."`
`"What?!`
` I don't get it!!"`
`"Rina-san told me to take you to her when you came to my house."`
`"...Hah??`
` The fuck is Ritsuko thinkin'...?"`
`Teppei followed me without hesitation.`
`We walked in the dark with a flashlight`
` to the place where`
` nobody comes`
` and nobody can hear us,`
` the place forgotten.`
`He asked me many things on the way, but I couldn't answer any of them.`
`I just told him to ask Rina.`
`The way I said it seemed to make him think that Rina was going to betray him and get married to my father for real.`
`Even though he was breathing heavily in a rage, he walked right behind me without any suspicions.`
`I knew this day was going to come very soon, so I was well prepared for it.`
` We reached the place where I originally planned to bring him, and I turned off the flashlight all of a sudden.`
`"Oh...!`
` What's goin' on...?"`
`Everyone gets nervous when the only light in the dark goes off.`
`...But this is my territory.`
`I didn't need any light.`
`I could feel my surroundings even better with my eyes closed.`
`I grabbed the big hatchet I'd hidden in a bush, and lifted it up high.`
`"I'm sorry. I guess the battery went out...`
` Hold on a second..."`
`"'Kay. Hurry it up."`
`I purposely sounded weak and helpless`
` while I raised the hatchet into the air.`
`"...Oh, I got a lighter.`
` I'll just fire this baby up..."`
`Teppei found a lighter in his pocket and lit it up.`
`He probably couldn't understand the sight illuminated by that small light.`
`He saw a girl lifting up a big hatchet right in front of him.`
`".........!!!!"`
`Teppei's eyes went wide.`
`He didn't understand what was going on, but he understood that his life was in danger.`
`And yet, he must not have been able to think fast enough to deal with it even though he understood what he should do.`
`Even if he could think fast enough and blocked his head with his arms, it wouldn't have meant anything.`
`I knew Teppei would come to my house eventually!`
`That's why I prepared for that day.`
`I just didn't think that preparation was going to bear fruit tonight.`
`I chose my weapon very carefully.`
`I planned when, where, and how I was going to attack him.`
`And so, there can only be one result!`
`The hatchet cut deeply into his forehead.`
`I felt an indescribable vibration through the hatchet when it hit him, and this told me that I broke his skull.`
`He bragged about how good he was at fighting at the coffee house, but he sure went down quickly when faced with a murderous weapon.`
`He was done in by a single blow.`
`Teppei slowly fell to his side with the hatchet in his forehead.`
`He looked like a victim in a B movie.`
`I killed this big guy with just one hatchet.`
`...He was probably quite experienced in the world of violence.`
`But, I was better than him when it came to killing.`
` Why? Because I've killed someone before.`
`It's all done now.`
`The bad people who deceived my father and tried to rob him blind are all gone.`
`I did what I had to do in order to protect my life.`
`...If I had this much courage and determination when my mom told me about the divorce, I might've killed Akihito.`
`If I did, I would've taken the life of only one.`
`...Because I couldn't do it back then, I've had to kill two people in the last two days.`
`Rena.`
` Let's finish it up.`
`There's already a place to hide his body.`
` I took care of everything.`
`My hands were wet, so I shone the flashlight at them.`
`...I thought it was blood, but it was just sweat.`
`Even so, I still felt uncomfortable, and shone the flashlight at my hands several times.`
`I did all this... in order to be happy.`
`I did all this, so I should be happy now.`
`I tried so hard that I got blood on my hands.`
`I wanted to get credit for that from him.`
`Oyashiro-sama.`
`Let me ask you a question. I can finally rewind the time back to the day everything started to go wrong, can't I?`
`I'm going to stay in Hinamizawa.`
`I'm going to live happily`
` with my father forever.`
`It's rare to see Rena sleep in class.`
`She isn't the kind of girl who sleeps in class because of staying up so late.`
`She had to be tired from doing housework or something.`
`Everybody seemed to be thinking the same thing. Nobody tried to wake her up, not even Chie-sensei.`
`She got up for a few seconds and went back to sleep.`
`She swayed back and forth like she was rowing a boat.`
`But... she's in class, so I should wake her up... right?`
`I was about to wake her up, but before my hand touched her, Mion gave me a sign not to.`
`"Let her sleep.`
` She must be really tired today."`
`"...Ah.`
` You're right."`
`I heard a few days ago that Rena lives with her father.`
`She studies during the day, plays a lot after school, and does things around the house after that.`
`...I didn't know that.`
`...I also didn't know her mother had divorced her father.`
`Mion told me that, and she also told me not to talk about it because Rena is still hurt by the divorce.`
`"...I didn't even notice that she's been through such a tough time."`
`"Rena is the kind of girl who doesn't show her pain to others.`
` She always looks happy and cheerful, but she might be acting that way on purpose."`
`Rena told me that happy days will one day come to an end.`
`She told me she knew that firsthand... what could she have been through?`
` I had no idea.`
`That's probably why she tried to spend as much time as peacefully and cheerfully as she could.`
`I must've hurt her feelings when I said I was bored of having happy days.`
`...When I thought about it, I felt bad for living off my parents, who are both healthy and happy.`
`For that matter... Satoko and Rika-chan lost their parents, too.`
`Mion lives with her grandmother, away from her parents, because she needs to learn to be the head of the Sonozaki family in the future.`
`When I realized all that... I felt bad about my situation.`
`"You don't have to feel bad about living with your parents."`
`Mion seemed to have read my mind.`
` She said it with a cool expression on her face.`
`"A family is the most common community for kids like us to live in.`
` But it's not the only community we have."`
`"...You mean friends?"`
`"You're right."`
`"Do you think we're as good as family to Rena...?"`
`"Rena does cleaning, laundry, cooking, and shopping, so she must be tired every day.`
` She could spend her afternoon taking naps.`
`But she doesn't do that.`
` She spends her afternoons playing with us. `
`That means... how should I put it...?`
` ...That means we're her best friends."`
`"So you're saying... we're friends with as much value as family to her?"`
`"..............."`
`Mion looked stunned.`
`As if she didn't understand what I was talking about.`
`"Ah... I didn't know what friends meant for you until today.`
` ...But I believe friends are just as important and valuable as family."`
`"......It's actually very easy to understand."`
`Rika-chan joined our conversation.`
`"The important thing is to have people around whom you can feel comfortable.`
` Sometimes you call them family or sometimes you call them friends. It's just a matter of the word you use."`
`"...Are friends the same as family to you, Rika-chan?"`
`"...Yes, they are.`
` I believe they are to Satoko, Mii, and Rena, too."`
`"I guess that's why we always try to stay together."`
`"Do you ever feel lonely when you're with your friends?"`
`"......They're my family.`
` So, I'm not lonely."`
`Mion nodded in agreement.`
`Satoko was talking with her other classmates, but I'm sure she would nod as well.`
`...Rena would, too.`
`"I'm... a little embarrassed."`
`"Why?"`
`"I've been using the word, 'friends'.`
` ...But I don't think I understood its true meaning until today.`
` Friends are... more important and irreplaceable than I thought they were."`
`"That's like...... common sense.`
` So, you should take this opportunity to remember that."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I will."`
`"I also recommend that you don't say that again!`
`Kei-chan, you just said something very embarrassing, you know?"`
`After all that, Mion still made fun of me.`
`I think I understand a little better why Rena was always so serious about having fun.`
`I want to be her best friend, and I want to do my best to be deserving of her effort.`
`"......Zzz......"`
`Rena snored. It sounded cute.`
`Chie-sensei let her sleep in class, but she couldn't let her get away with snoring.`
`"Class president, wake her up, please."`
`"Rena, get up."`
`"Hwwaaaa..."`
`Rena was still half asleep and made a strange noise. Everybody in the class laughed.`
`Rena noticed they were laughing at her, woke up right away, and acted like she wasn't sleeping at all.`
`It looked really funny, and I burst into a fit of laughter.`
`Outside the window, the sky was blue, and the clouds were pure white. It was still June, but it looked like the middle of summer.`
`This perfect weather wouldn't last forever.`
`It could get cloudy and rain all of a sudden.`
`That's why we had to play and raise a ruckus while we still had this perfect weather.`
`The cries of the cicadas sound as if they're laughing at us because we still have some classes left.`
` Ahh, damn it. I can't wait for school to finish.`
`"Keiichi-kun,`
` you look very happy. Did something special happen today?"`
`"Nothing.`
` Today is today. Tomorrow is tomorrow, right?"`
`"......Yeah..."`
`"I'm just happy that we have perfect weather today.`
` I don't care about the weather tomorrow.`
` I want to enjoy today as much as I can.`
` When the weather changes, I don't want to regret that I didn't."`
`I learned that from Rena.`
`I learned that peaceful days are the happiest days you can have and that they're irreplaceable.`
`"Mion, what are we doing today for club activities?`
` We need something very exciting for the punishment, too."`
`"Heh heh heh!`
` That's the spirit I like, Kei-chan.`
` Because you insist, I'll put you through a living hell...!"`
`"K-Keiichi-kun, don't provoke her too much..."`
`"Hey, are you scared, Rena?`
` I know you're better than that!`
` Let's show her our true power again!`
` Remember, we haven't brought an end to our last battle."`
`I grinned at her, and she grinned back.`
`"Ahaha, I do remember that.`
` Okay, let's do it, then!"`
`"Rena-san, you certainly got me last time!`
`For that, I must pay you back with interest!"`
`"This is getting very interesting.`
`It's going to be a blast! Heh heh heh!"`
`"......I can't wait for school to finish."`
`I couldn't wait either, but...`
`That time we spend just talking together is also very precious.`
`"Yeah.`
` It would be nice if school ended soon."`
