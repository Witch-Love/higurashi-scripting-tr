`Walking with only Mion to school made me miss Rena a lot.`
`"...What's wrong, Kei-chan?`
` Why are you looking around?"`
`"What?`
` Oh, nothing."`
`It was the same old path to school... but I felt nervous for some reason.`
`...I wondered what Rena meant when she said she was going to win a come-from-behind victory last night.`
`I couldn't stop feeling like something dangerous was going to happen.`
`Rena thought Mion was one of her enemies.`
`...She could be lying in wait to attack Mion with a knife...`
`"Don't worry.`
` Rena isn't going to do something as rash as that.`
` Even if she does, I can protect myself!"`
`Mion said it brightly as if trying to tell me she wasn't afraid of anything.`
`But... I couldn't be optimistic like her, because I knew exactly what Rena was going through.`
`Rena must be determined by now, and she probably wouldn't mind dying fighting against Mion if she wasn't going to win anyway...`
`...Of course, that didn't mean she was definitely going to take violent action.`
` ...But I couldn't deny the possibility, either.`
`"This ol' man is more concerned about the reason why Rena went crazy all of a sudden."`
`...Was there any reason...?`
`I remembered... the tragedy.`
`...I couldn't remember`
` what made the world go crazy...`
`But I remembered we got lost in that awfully scary world.`
`It started... with small things, and those small things continued to pile up one after another.`
`If you thought about it calmly, you'd laugh, because it was really a stupid thing.`
`...But once those little tiny stupid things started to bother you, you couldn't ignore them... It was that kind of disease.`
`...If you could call it one.`
`But... there must have been a reason.`
`There must have been a reason that made the world go crazy.`
`But it must be such a small thing that you couldn't even notice.`
`...And unfortunately, the reason was very difficult to understand... and you wouldn't be able to figure it out until you died.`
`"I have a relative who is a doctor.`
` He said that if you have a tumor in specific parts of your brain, it can change your personality. Make you a totally different person.`
`People who suffered from this disease used to be considered haunted by devils or possessed by foxes. People dramatized it like it was something occult."`
`"...You mean Rena is suffering from a physical disease in her brain?"`
`"In her case, it might be better to say that it's a mental disease.`
` ...Rena was upset and mentally unstable because of the murder of Rina and Teppei. `
`At a time like that, that stupid Ooishi told her about what happened to Tomitake-san in an exaggerated way..."`
`"...I think Ooishi-san and Takano-san's scrapbooks have many things in common."`
`"Really? Like what?"`
`"...Well... he believes in the series of mysterious deaths of Hinamizawa, but that's a delusion, isn't it?`
` ...I mean, something actually did happen for five years in a row. `
`...But I think... there is no series of murders in the first place."`
`It was true that the mysterious incidents happened five years in a row.`
`...But they were each solved individually... It was the same as a past you didn't need to talk about.`
`We thought of them as a series of mysterious deaths, which is why we thought something was going to happen this year, too.`
`It led us to think that there was a conspiracy`
` and that the Sonozaki family was behind it...`
` We connect those things to the series of mysterious deaths, but we shouldn't do that in the first place.`
`Just like I tried to keep my distance from Rena when I found out about her dark past...`
` wasn't everybody trying to keep their distance from the dark past of Hinamizawa...?`
`Takano-san's scrapbooks are a good example. She dramatized both recent incidents and old cruel history,`
` and she made feasible stories out of them, saying that the Sonozaki family was behind it all.`
`Ooishi-san did the same thing, too.`
` He was so convinced that the Sonozaki family was behind it all that it was making him interpret things the wrong way.`
`...In that sense, we could say Ooishi-san believed in the same delusion as Rena.`
`"I think the Sonozaki family is partially accountable for that because you guys act like you're behind it every time something happens. `
`...In this village, people think it's the doing of the Sonozaki family whenever something strange happens.`
` ...It's like a magic word that makes everything settle down. `
`...It's like those people who say they can explain all phenomena in this world with plasma."`
`"Oh, and what's that supposed to mean?`
` Are you saying all of this is the Sonozaki family's fault?"`
`"Exactly. It's all your fault.`
` So, I'll call you Plasma Mion from now on.`
` Aha, that sounds like a wrestler's name."`
`"Well, I like professional wrestlers!`
`Hey Kei-chan, do you know what abdominal stretching is?!"`
`"S-Stop, I don't want to wrestle with you in this freaking hot weather!!`
` N-no, that hurts!!`
` Stooop!!!"`
`"Good morning, Keiichi-san."`
`"...Good morning."`
`Satoko and Rika-chan looked a little sad when they saw only the two of us.`
`...If the three of us came to school together like always, they would've been really happy.`
`But our classmates were as noisy as usual. Nobody seemed to make a big deal about Rena's absence.`
`Chie-sensei was going to be here soon, and she'd start morning homeroom.`
`Everyone was fooling around as if they didn't want to miss a second of the time until then.`
`"Hey, something stinks today. Close the windows!"`
`"Silly, it'll be hotter in here if we do that!!"`
`It smelled like gasoline or something, and it really stank.`
`Someone from the forestry service must have been putting gasoline into the construction equipment or something.`
`Some students near the windows were making a fuss because they wanted to close the windows to shut out the smell.`
`Our school wasn't a normal school, compared to others.`
` We were using a part of the forestry service building. Unusual things like this happened sometimes.`
`"This is nothing!`
` I remember they once brought a few big piles of juniper branches!`
`That was awful. It had this distinct irritating odor that gave us all headaches."`
`"What's a 'juniper'?"`
`"......Meep,`
` that's a name of a vegetable.`
`We sometimes put it in curry."`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` You should look for it next time you go grocery shopping."`
`"Huh???`
` I know little about vegetables, but it sounds like it would be better to make Rika and Keiichi-san taste it first, just in case."`
`"What?!`
` Our ball is missing!`
` You hid it again, didn't you, Houjou?"`
`The boys seemed to be looking for their ball for a while, and they yelled at Satoko.`
`"Why would I hide such a stupid thing?`
`If I was going to hide anything, I'd hide something better than that."`
`"Hey, Chie-sensei is coming!!`
` Everybody take a seat!!"`
`"Hello, everyone.`
` Get to your seats."`
`I kept thinking about Rena the whole time during class.`
`I thought about what she said last night... I wonder what her "come-from-behind victory" means.`
`According to Takano-san's delusion, the masterminds behind the bioterrorism were the Three Families and a group of fanatical believers that controlled those Three.`
`...In other words, the Sonozaki family.`
`What could Rena do alone against them?`
`Mion lived with her grandmother, the leader of the Sonozaki family. There were only two of them in the house.`
`...It was possible that Rena would try to break into their house with a knife.`
`But I'd already come up with that possibility last night.`
`That's why I called Mion and warned her.`
`On the way to school this morning, Mion told me some bodyguards from the Corps had been at her house since this morning.`
`She told me she'd be guarded herself, too.`
`...There was a black car parked near the school gate. They must have been the bodyguards.`
`...But... according to Takano's parasite theory, the battle wouldn't end just by attacking the leader of the Sonozaki family.`
`According to the delusion she believes in, the conditions of her victory were more complicated than that.`
`She needed to expose the group of fanatics who are behind the Sonozaki family,`
` and she needed to destroy their research on the "parasite".`
`Plus, Rena didn't have much time left, thanks to that suspicious poison she mentioned.`
`...But how exactly could she win a come-from-behind victory under circumstances like that?`
`...She might interpret that the town council are the group of fanatics.`
`If so, she might attack them the next time they have a meeting at the Shrine.`
`The town council meets once a month at most.`
` It would be hard to believe that they were holding a meeting today.`
`She probably thought the place researching the "parasite" is... the Irie Clinic.`
`Rena suspected that there was something fishy about the clinic from the beginning.`
` ...And that suspicion must've changed to certainty in her head by now.`
`Did that mean she was going to attack the clinic?`
`...This wasn't like an action movie. What could she do all by herself?`
` ...Was she going to start a fire?`
`No, that would be pointless.`
`In order to expose the conspiracy, she'd have to get proof that they were actually studying the parasite.`
`...Was she going to break into the clinic and get questionable weird samples...?`
`The last problem of all was how much time she had left.`
`...If she believed she didn't have much time left, especially under desperate, disadvantageous conditions, she might try to stab whoever she thought of as an enemy.`
`...But Rena sounded like she really believed she would regain her happy and peaceful days after everything was over.`
`Rena probably meant she was going to stay alive and win.`
`Was there something like an antidote?`
`It didn't have to be real.`
`As long as it was an antidote to Rena's delusion, it didn't matter what it was. It could even be the water you washed your vegetables with.`
`But if she thought she could get the antidote so easily, she wouldn't have been so desperate about the time she has left.`
`...The antidote must be difficult for her to get.`
`...The easiest place for that, in her delusion... was that it was hidden somewhere in the clinic.`
`Putting it all together like that... I felt like Irie and his clinic were in danger.`
`Now that I thought about it, the elderly people in the village, including the members of the town council, hung out in the waiting room of the clinic all the time!`
`...If most of the board members happened to gather there, for her, it'd be the perfect place to attack...`
`I told Mion about that during lunch break.`
`"...If this were a normal situation, I'd say she wouldn't do such a stupid thing... but...`
`I can't actually deny the possibility...`
` I'm going to call my house. `
`I'll make sure that they send some people to the clinic."`
`Mion didn't object to my crazy idea.`
`She put down her chopsticks and went to the teacher's office to make a phone call.`
`"It sounds so dangerous.`
` ...I can hardly believe Rena-san is going to do such a scary thing.`
` Are you sure she's going to attack the clinic?"`
`"Maybe she will,`
` maybe she won't.`
` ...But if that happens, we're screwed.`
` ...We need to prevent that disaster from happening."`
`"......I hope nothing happens at all."`
