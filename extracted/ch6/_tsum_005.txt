`My mother was a very busy woman.`
`The harder she worked, the more her work was valued, and she kept getting promoted.`
`She sought to go higher and higher. She was always shining, and she was my hero.`
`My mother started her career as a fashion designer at a small clothing factory in Okinomiya.`
`My father was a designer, too.`
`They met through their jobs, and soon got married.`
`They lived in a small apartment in Okinomiya,`
` but they moved to my grandma's house, our current house, in Hinamizawa when she got pregnant with me.`
`We lived there until right before I went to elementary school.`
`Now that I think about it, that was the happiest time of my life.`
`I felt happy every day and believed without a doubt that tomorrow would be the same.`
`I was so happy that I took it for granted and didn't even feel the happiness.`
`I really did feel happy every day.`
`I was small at that time and didn't really understand what was going on, but it seemed like the company my parents were working for was having financial difficulties.`
`So, my mother and a few other young designers started talking about leaving the company and going independent.`
`...After many things happened and the situation grew complicated,`
` they got an offer to work at a big design firm in Ibaraki and they took the offer.`
`At that time, I heard my mother saying many difficult words like 'limited partnership' and 'business alliance', but in short, what she wanted to do was move to Ibaraki.`
`My mother and her peers were hired because their talent and experience made them immediate assets at their new company.`
`However, my father wasn't one of them.`
`Unfortunately, my father wasn't as talented as my mother was.`
`So, moving to Ibaraki meant that my father had to give up being a fashion designer.`
`My mother's new company had high expectations of her talent and promised her a responsible project.`
`She didn't want to waste her growing talent and passion by living in a rural town like Hinamizawa.`
`So my mother convinced my father to quit his job and move to Ibaraki to support her and to help her build her career.`
`Back then, moving meant that I had to say goodbye to my close friends.`
`I didn't want to move, and I kept crying about it.`
`After we moved to Ibaraki, my mother was a big success.`
`Not only did she have great leadership skills, she was full of energy, and I believe she made the best use of her talents to succeed.`
`She came home late every night and barely had any days off.`
`When she had a big project, she often stayed entire nights at her office.`
`But when she came home, she always looked fulfilled and wore a happy smile that she had never worn when she was in Hinamizawa.`
`She was shining, and I remember I always wanted to shine like her when I grew up.`
`On the other hand, my father wasn't doing so well.`
`He couldn't find a job as a fashion designer, so he took a clerical job at a small company, but he kept changing positions.`
`He couldn't use the experience that he had cultivated, and it was very hard for him.`
`But, he was very understanding.`
`He started to take care of things around the house for my mother, who got busier and busier, having one project after another.`
`He cleaned the house, did the laundry, and came to my school events.`
`However, he couldn't cook. He did cook rice, but always bought side dishes from a grocery store.`
`We ate dinner without my mother more and more often.`
`"I guess she's busy again."`
`Every time I said that, he always told me, "your mother is working very hard.`
` So, let's support her, Reina."`
`That was what he always told me.`
`I decided to help my father with the cooking.`
`I thought it was a good idea to learn how to cook, since he wasn't good at it.`
`Whenever my mother cooked, I helped her and tried to learn how to cook from her.`
`She apologized for not having enough time to cook for us, but she was happy that I was learning.`
`I think I wrote in my school yearbook that I wanted to be a clothing designer in the future, just like my mother.`
`But... apparently I lacked my mother's exceptional sense of style.`
`She used to tell me, "taste is something that you're born with, not something that you cultivate."`
`...I remember I was discouraged to be a designer because of that.`
`That was why I decided to reach her by getting better at things she wasn't so good at, instead of trying to be like her.`
`I wanted to be good not only at cooking, but also at doing things around the house such as cleaning, doing the laundry, and grocery shopping.`
`I remember my father was really happy that I did all that for him, because he wasn't good at it at all.`
`He couldn't find a job and spent a lot of time at home, so he seemed to enjoy spending time doing the housework with his daughter more than anything.`
`I started to become better and better at filling in for my mother,`
` and she started to get too busy to do any of the house work at all, and she moved on to a more responsible position at her job.`
`She took me out to many places, as if to compensate for leaving me alone all the time.`
`She used to say, "let's go eat something delicious without telling your father" and took me out to a restaurant.`
`She took me to high-class restaurants and amusement parks.`
`Sometimes it was only me and my mother. Sometimes it was with her friends from work.`
`She took me to a beach barbecue one summer with those friends.`
`I was introduced as her daughter, and every one of them pampered me.`
`I still remember there was this one guy who particularly doted on me. He was a good-looking young man (I called him "Uncle" once and he got mad at me) who was nicely tanned with dyed brown hair.`
`This young man often came with us when we went out.`
`When my mother took me somewhere, she usually made several phone calls for her work during the day, and sometimes she took me out to a place where she could also do her work at the same time. `
`So, I didn't feel awkward when people from her work came with us.`
`But I always preferred to be alone with her, so I was happier when we could do that.`
`One day, she took me to a very high-end part of town.`
`Of course, she always spoiled me whenever we went out.`
`She bought me things and let me eat whatever I wanted.`
`But, she especially spoiled me on that day.`
`She took me to many expensive-looking boutiques and accessory stores.`
`She was about to buy me something, but I told her not to get it because it didn't look good on me. Without hesitation, she bought it anyway.`
`I remember there were many zeros on the price tag.`
`On that day, I realized my mother's design work had made her a very successful woman and she was earning a lot of money.`
`We took a break at a ridiculously expensive-looking restaurant that probably charged 1,000 yen for a glass of orange juice.`
`My mother clapped her hands and spoke to me with a smile on her face.`
`She asked, "Reina, would you like to make your dream come true?"`
`When I was in kindergarten, my teacher gave students a topic to draw a picture of. The topic was "my dream" and I drew myself eating a mountain of fruit parfait all by myself.`
`What my mother meant to say was that she was going to make that dream come true for me.`
`It was a normal day.`
`It wasn't my birthday or anything.`
`But since my mother always spoiled me when we went out together, I didn't feel awkward about it at all and I accepted her offer with a happy smile.`
`There were five or six of fruit parfaits in front of me.`
`I remember it looked exactly like the world I drew, and I felt like I was floating in that dream world.`
`It was too much for us to finish,`
` but we dug our spoons into it as if we were playing in the mud, and we really enjoyed eating it together.`
`It was my first time to experience getting full by eating only fruit parfaits, and I remember I was very happy.`
`I enjoyed tasting the happiness and chatting with my mother.`
`"Reina-chan,`
` do you remember the man who went to the movie and had dinner with us last time?"`
`"...Umm, are you talking about Uncle Akihito?`
` Hau, though I can't call him that or he's going to hit me."`
`"Hahahahahaha.`
` Reina-chan, do you like Akihito-san?"`
`"I hate him!!`
` He always teases me."`
`"That's because he likes you.`
` You got along well with him at the barbecue."`
`"Well...`
` I get along with him every now and then.`
` Every now and then."`
`My mother laughed.`
`I didn't know why she brought up the subject, but I didn't really pay attention to it, because I was too young.`
`Now that I think about it, she was breaking the news.`
`I just didn't notice it.`
`"Reina-chan,`
` who do you like better, your father or me?"`
`"You."`
`It wasn't that I hated my father or anything, but I thought giving her that answer was appropriate, after she spoiled me so much.`
`"If I said I'm going to live in another house away from your father, which of us would you like to live with?"`
`"...Ummm.`
` Huh.........?"`
`"I'm thinking`
` about divorcing your father and getting married to Akihito-san."`
`At that time, my mother was a very successful woman.`
`I didn't know this at the time, but she was drafted by a headhunter to work at a bigger company, where she was promoted to a higher and more responsible position, one where she could bring out the most of her talent.`
`Of course, the position wasn't the only thing she gained.`
`Compared to my father's low salary, my mother was earning enough money to support a family of three and still have some left over.`
`I'd kind of realized it from the way she spent money.`
`The greater a position she achieved, the more she spent time with people at her level.`
`All of them were bright and talented.`
`Compared to them, my father might've looked unattractive to her.`
`I liked Uncle Akihito.`
`But, I liked him as one of my mother's friends, not in the same way I liked my father.`
`I liked my father and mother equally, so it was very shocking to me that my mother wanted to divorce him. I felt as if the ground below me was beginning to crack.`
`That expression, I realized, actually fit my situation very well.`
`I had to choose which side of the cracked ground I wanted to stand on.`
`My mother told me to live with her, at her new house.`
`'Her new house' meant the house Uncle Akihito lived in.`
`I thought a house was a sanctuary for a family.`
`I believed that a house was a holy place where strangers couldn't easily enter.`
`...That was why I couldn't believe her. How could she let a stranger invade such a holy place so easily?`
`Why do you hate my father?`
`My mother looked down and didn't answer.`
`I asked her another question.`
`Why can't you stay with my father?`
`I think that was the hardest and the most heartbreaking of all questions for my mother to answer.`
`In short, my mother had cheated on him.`
`She loved another man who was more attractive than my father. It was just that and nothing more.`
`I knew more than anybody that it wasn't my father's fault.`
`First of all, he decided to move from Hinamizawa to support my mother as much as he could.`
`For him, nothing good had come from that.`
`Actually, I think he had a very tough time since we moved to Ibaraki.`
`But, he volunteered to be her support and tried very hard to do that.`
`I thought my mother appreciated his support.`
`So...`
` I took her decision as a betrayal.`
`I told her that I disagreed with everything, including their divorce.`
`I said it very loudly and made everybody in the store jump.`
`Sure, continue your relationship with Uncle Akihito, but don't divorce my father.`
`I feel bad for him.`
`I feel terrible for him.`
`He has been doing nothing but support you patiently this whole time. How could you do such a cruel thing to him?`
`I screamed as loud as I could.`
`Then my mother answered.`
`"...It's`
` too`
` late."`
`Why?!`
` You haven't talked with my father about this, have you? It's not too late!`
`"I'm...`
`...... pregnant."`
`I don't know whether my mother actually told him about the divorce in person.`
`A middle-aged woman who called herself a lawyer came to the house several times to talk to my father on my mother's behalf. She sometimes called him, too.`
`My father begged the lawyer to let him speak directly to my mother many times, but it never happened.`
`I could tell by the way they talked that he had no clue when my mother told him she wanted a divorce.`
`Well, again, I'm not even sure if she told him in person.`
`The lawyer told him not to meet my mother, not to call her at work, and many other things, too.`
` To top it all off,`
` she told him not to see my mother ever again.`
`He wanted to talk to her. He called some of their mutual friends, but he only found out the name of the guy she was having affair with and nothing more.`
`He asked me,`
`"Do you know the guy?"`
`I told him,`
` "I do."`
`I also told him`
` that he was a funny guy and had given me candy many times.`
`...I'll never forget how he looked when I told him that.`
`He hit me for the first time.`
`He hit me so hard that his hand print stayed on my cheek for a while.`
` Then, he fell on the floor and cried loudly.`
`And then, I started to cry, too.`
`...I didn't cry because he hit me.`
`Uncle Akihito was kind to me, so I liked him, and talked to him out of courtesy.`
`...No, that wasn't it. Girls had to be kind to everybody.`
` ...That's what I thought.`
`But, I was wrong.`
`I learned in this world that there are people you should be nice to, and "enemies" you shouldn't be nice to.`
`The "enemies" are the ones who would destroy my life with their very existence.`
`Whether they mean to harm me or not doesn't matter.`
`They're like weeds growing in a flowerbed.`
`Dandelions are innocent, but they take all of the nutrition for the tulips from the soil. That's why we have to pull them out.`
`The dandelions did nothing wrong...`
` But, they're`
` the enemy.`
` Enemies are bad people.`
`That guy was a bad person.`
`I shouldn't have accepted him.`
`I should've rejected him with everything I had.`
`By doing so, I might've been able to disrupt their relationship.`
`By doing so, I might've been able to make my mother feel like their relationship was not going to work.`
`If I tried to do so... my parents wouldn't have had to break up.`
`My father and I cried together... but, we cried for different reasons.`
`He must've cried because it happened so fast and didn't make any sense to him.`
`I cried`
` because I regretted that I let it happen when I had the chance to prevent it.`
`My father stroked my cheek and opened his mouth to apologize`
` ...but he couldn't speak and just cried with me.`
`One day, the lawyer let me see my mother.`
`My mother asked me to live with her at her house again.`
`I didn't know what to say, so I just kept looking down and listened to her apologies.`
`My father knew that I was going to see my mother on that day.`
`So, he handed me a letter and told me to give it to her.`
`I don't know what he wrote in that letter.`
`But for some reason, I was able to imagine what kind of things he wrote when I felt it through the envelope.`
`...After all,`
` the letter inside the envelope had`
` a rough surface.`
`He must've been crying while writing the letter, and his tears made the letter all wrinkled when it dried.`
`My mother took the letter from me, told me that she'd read it later, and was about to put it in her bag.`
`I stopped her and told her to read it there.`
`I wanted to see`
` how she was going to take the last words that my father had left to her.`
`But my mother didn't read it.`
`She told me she wanted to read it alone later, and she put it in her bag.`
`At that time,`
` I realized.`
`...No, it was more than that.`
`I should say`
` I knew`
` because it was so obvious.`
`I knew that my mother was lying.`
`She had no intention of reading my father's letter.`
`She was going to throw it away after I was gone, but she lied just because she wanted to seem like a nice person in front of me.`
`The slight curl in her eyebrows and lips told me that more clearly than anything else.`
`At that moment, I finally knew something else.`
`The guy she was having an affair with wasn't the only bad person.`
`My mother was also a bad person.`
`Since that moment,`
` the existence of my mother disappeared from my world like dry ice evaporating.`
`I didn't have to hesitate about whom to live with anymore.`
`"I don't want to go to your house.`
` The Ryuugu house is my home.`
` I don't want to see you anymore.`
` Please don't even call me."`
`"But Reina, if you live with your father, you won't have..."`
`At that moment, I hated my name for the first time in my life.`
`"Please`
` don't call me Reina ever again.`
` ...I have to go now.`
` Goodbye."`
`Those were`
` my last words to my mother...`
` no, to the woman who used to be my mother.`
`After that, I spent many days without feeling anything. I didn't know if the days were long or short. I didn't know which season I was living in.`
`It was supposed to be nothing out of the ordinary, not having my mother around.`
`...But, every time my father saw things that reminded him of her...`
` like her toothbrush,`
` her tea cup,`
` or her favorite books,`
` he shed tears, which left me frustrated.`
`That's why I decided to completely remove her belongings from the house.`
`I roughly threw her things into a black trash bag.`
` I started to do so frantically. `
`By the time I knocked down her wardrobe,`
` threw her music box hard on the floor,`
` and broke her mirror...`
`.........`
` my mind was already not working properly.`
`.........When I try to remember what happened after that...`
` I feel disoriented.`
`That's because the pills the doctor gave me back then made me feel disoriented and lethargic every time I took them.`
`It seems that dullness hit me especially hard,`
` since every time I try to remember that time, it makes me feel disoriented and lethargic, just like the pills made me feel...`
`...I destroyed everything that smelled like my mother,`
` but the thing I wanted to destroy the most might've been myself.`
`Even after I threw all of her belongings away, I still couldn't stop feeling regret, and I decided to blame myself in the end.`
`Maybe I was thinking that I wanted to do damage to her reputation and successful life by destroying her daughter, destroying myself.`
`When I was about to reach`
` that very last resolution...`
`Oyashiro-sama came to me.`
`Oyashiro-sama told me`
` to go back to Hinamizawa.`
`Yes, all of this was because of his curse.`
`Oyashiro-sama brought a curse upon the Ryuugu family because we broke his rule and abandoned Hinamizawa.`
`After I figured that out,`
` .........`
`everything started to make sense to me, all the crazy things that happened after my mother was gone.`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama did all of that to us.`
`It was Oyashiro-sama's voice that was telling us to come back to Hinamizawa.`
`That's right.`
` We should've stayed in Hinamizawa.`
` Everything went crazy because we moved.`
` We had to go back to Hinamizawa.`
`...I started feeling disoriented again... and a dull pain ran through my head.`
`It might be a scream from within me telling me not to push myself too hard to remember any further.`
`The house where we used to live in Hinamizawa was still there.`
`My grandma already passed away, and the house was the only property she left for us.`
`I remembered that I used to live in Hinamizawa, but all I remembered was that it was a village that I used to live in until right before I went to elementary school.`
`I remembered the atmosphere of the village, too, but that was all I remembered.`
`I forgot the streets and even the names of close friends I used to play with.`
`The neighbors knew that the son of the deceased woman had come back divorced,`
` but they didn't know us and we didn't know them.`
`So, it was almost like we moved to a new place.`
`...However, as far as I was concerned,`
`it still was my hometown that I had to come back to.`
`At first, everything was inconvenient compared to life in Ibaraki, and it was hard for both of us to adjust.`
`But, we renovated the old house, and it was only me and my father.`
`Life here seemed to make my father forget his pain from the divorce.`
`Mii-chan was very kind to me, and I started to get used to my new life, too.`
`I did everything around the house, and we gradually went back to a time when we used to live happily.`
`Anybody can live a happy life.`
`People sometimes say that some people are born to be unhappy, but I believe that's just an excuse for people who don't even want to try.`
`I won't give in to fate.`
`I'll never give up trying to recapture the happy times that I lost...`
` ...I'm going to become happy to the point where I don't even feel the happiness anymore.`
`I'm not going to cry anymore.`
` I'll never cry again.`
` I used up all of my tears on that night my father hit me.`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama is over because we came back to Hinamizawa.`
`So, I'm going to have a happy life from now on...`
`All of a sudden, big raindrops hit the roof of the car, and I recovered my senses.`
`It was still raining hard.`
`It had already gotten dark outside.`
`The shadows the table lamp created were very dark, and it looked as if there's nothing else around me.`
`If I turned off this light`
` ...would everything in this world disappear?`
`I turned off...`
` the light.`
`Darkness swallowed me.`
`But, the cold air and the sound of rain didn't change a bit, and that made me realize I was still in this world.`
`The curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Did the curse of Oyashiro-sama do those crazy things to my family?`
`Or did I convince myself it did as an excuse for myself because I didn't want to feel guilty about the divorce?`
` ...Sometimes I'm not sure.`
`Since that time, Oyashiro-sama hasn't come to me.`
`...I sometimes feel like it was a delusion I created because I was mentally ill.`
`But...`
` ...he did come`
` at that time.`
`I'm sure about that.`
`Am I right, Oyashiro-sama?`
`I was unhappy after I left Hinamizawa. But, I came back and I'm happy now.`
`But,`
` where am I supposed to go now that I'm unhappy in Hinamizawa?`
` ...Where?`
`"Stop it, Rena...`
` ...Don't think that you're unhappy.`
` I am happy.`
` I will be happy.`
` I can definitely be happy...!"`
`Suddenly, I felt that if this darkness swallowed me, I'd never be able to be happy again.`
`I found the switch of the table lamp, and turned it back on.`
`When I looked at the clock, it was already past\n11 PM.`
`I had to go home. I wouldn't have time to prepare my lunch for tomorrow.`
` At least, I'd have to set the timer on the rice cooker.`
`It didn't look like the rain was going to stop anytime soon.`
`...I looked out of the window to see the rain, but could only see my reflection.`
`I talked to that reflection in the window.`
`I'm so glad that my father's happy.`
`...He'd been acting like he was dead for a long time.`
`The smile on his face is a good sign that he's regaining his former happy life.`
`He became miserable...`
` because of me.`
`That's why I don't mind doing things for him until he regains his smile and we become truly happy.`
`When I stay here alone for a while, it gives him some time to be alone with her...`
` plus I don't have to fake a smile.`
`But then...`
` my reflection in the window tells me.`
`Rena, you're such a good girl.`
`...You're kind to everybody and love them equally.`
` You can make anybody like you.`
`But, did you forget something...?`
`In this world, there are people you should be kind to...`
` and`
` enemies`
` that you have to reject with all you've got. I thought you learned that lesson...`
`No, don't listen to her.`
`...My reflection is always mean.`
`She always says mean things and makes fun of my worries.`
`...But, she always tells me things that I can't say myself...`
`Let's go home, Rena.`
` To your home.`
`Forget about the mean Rena in the mirror.`
`I was a bit hungry by then.`
`After all the desserts I ate... I still got hungry.`
`I almost forgot.`
` ...Rina-san bought me a shortcake.`
`I've never had a shortcake from Angel Mort, but I bet it'll taste good.`
`I'd have to give my thanks to Rina-san the next time I see her.`
`...Rina-san speaks in a way that makes it very clear how she grew up, but I'm sure she's a good person.`
`That's because she's so good to my father.`
`I did everything I could to make my father smile, but I failed. On the other hand, Rina-san can put a big smile on his face so easily.`
`I have to thank Rina-san.`
`I have to thank her for cheering up my father.`
`But... I don't know why.`
`......I just don't like...`
` her perfume...`
