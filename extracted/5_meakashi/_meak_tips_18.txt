`After that, I joined the youth group in the search for Kimiyoshi.`
`I went down the town council's phone directory and called to see if he had visited, then had the group split according to the circular notice divisions and sent them to search the town.`
`Everybody seemed to be assuming they wouldn't find him.`
`But since I knew they definitely never would, it was just bothersome to me.`
`Even after midnight, they were all still enthusiastically looking for him.`
`I bore the sleepiness while yawning.`
`Then I heard somebody whisper.`
`"Last year...... we did the same thing when Satoshi Houjou-kun went missing."`
`...The youth group was looking for someone who would never be found...`
` just like last year.`
`I was yawning because I knew this.`
`Last year, there must also have been some people who were yawning... and grinning on the inside.`
`"......When did we stop searching last year, do you remember?"`
`"Hmm?`
` When Satoshi Houjou-kun was missing?`
` Oh, what time was it?"`
`"I guess that was around midnight."`
`It was already two in the morning.`
`Although they spent this much time searching for Kimiyoshi... they didn't do the same when Satoshi-kun went missing.`
`After all, some people knew they wouldn't find him.`
`They must've been sleepy.`
`They must've said they should leave it to the police.`
` Shit... shit... I want to kill the people who said that...`
