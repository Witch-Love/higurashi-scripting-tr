`June, 1983.`
`A case of serial disappearances occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City.`
`The suspect is Shion Sonozaki.`
`Allegedly, she abducted, imprisoned and killed four Hinamizawan residents (Oryou Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou) between June 19th and the 21st.`
`Preliminary investigation into the incident was delayed at the time due to insufficient evidence, but by chance, the case was solved rather abruptly.`
`On the morning of the 22nd, a patrol vehicle stationed outside the Sonozaki mansion heard screams from within, and personnel infiltrated the premises as an emergency measure.`
`The suspect's missing elder sister (Mion Sonozaki) and two of her classmates (Keiichi Maebara and Reina Ryuugu) were taken into custody.`
`However, Keiichi Maebara who had previously been lured into the crime scene had sustained stab wounds perpetrated by the suspect. He was immediately transferred to an emergency unit, but they were diagnosed as a minor injury. `
`Having been the one with the utmost opportunity to engage in conversation with the suspect until the very end, he will be subject to interrogation once he has recovered from the shock.`
`Furthermore, the apprehended suspect was found collapsed at a place approximately 2 meters away from where Keiichi Maebara was restrained, and sustained scratch wounds on her throat. She was also transferred to an emergency facility, but was pronounced dead at 13:48 on the 22nd. `
`The official autopsy determines that the immediate cause of death was hemorrhagic shock due to excessive blood loss. `
`Hair, pieces of skin, and blood of the four missing people (Oryou Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou) were recovered from the hidden chamber that was discovered in the outbuilding basement of the Sonozaki family property, where they were supposedly killed. `
`It was concluded that the victims were assaulted in that hidden chamber.`
`The victims' bodies were discovered at the bottom of an old well, as per the testimony of the victim, Mion Sonozaki`
`In addition, investigations continue into any possible connection to the Series of Mysterious Deaths in recent years, but no evidence of Shion Sonozaki's direct or indirect involvement has been found.`
`There are still many obscurities to the motive behind the incident, and due to extreme non-cooperation from the Sonozaki family and residents of Hinamizawa, a large amount of time will be required to clarify matters on this front.`
`The local police who are familiar with the region offer that this may have been an internal lynching incident, as punishment for sacrilegious acts carried out against Hinamizawa's religious beliefs.`
`It has been established that the incident is unique and rooted in the regional community beliefs, and a cautious investigation has been ordered by the prefectural police.`
`We expected to gain valuable hints from the missing person and the suspect's sister, Mion Sonozaki, who was under confinement for the longest time period, `
`but it was observed that she had sustained severe mental trauma from the incident, and her inquiry has been postponed in favor of her psychological and physical recovery.`
`According to her primary care physician, although her condition is fairly serious, there is a strong prospect of recovery, and she is at present undergoing rehabilitation with support from her close friends.`
`...Several weeks have passed since then.`
`After that incident, I was rescued by Ooishi-san and his team whom Rena had summoned.`
`I had no other after-effects aside from my consciousness that had been wiped white.`
`If I were to have any at all... it would have to be the deep scars that had been left inside my heart. `
`As I was being examined at the hospital, I was subjected to various queries from Ooishi-san.`
`I tried to answer him with whatever little I knew... but I had no idea if it met his expectations and neither did I bear any responsibility to do so.`
`From what I had heard, Shion had already lost too much blood by the time the police had arrived... and she had stopped breathing.`
`They urgently called for an ambulance and took her to the clinic, but there was barely any time for first aid and she took her last breath... `
`The silver lining was that Mion who had been captive in her cell, was safe, and taken into custody by the police.`
`Up until the moment I lost consciousness, I was afraid that Shion may fly into a rage and murder Mion... but I was just glad we had managed to avoid the worst-case scenario. `
`Only... when Mion was rescued, she was emaciated and had sustained severe psychological trauma.`
`...Apparently at the time of her rescue, she had been completely unable to respond to the police's questions.`
`Right now, Mion is admitted at a large hospital in the vicinity and undergoing treatment for her psychological and physical injuries.`
`In the beginning, when Rena and I went to visit, her eyes were downcast in desolation and she looked completely worn out... it was a horrible state to be in.`
`But despite it all, as of late, she is on her way to recovery... finally well enough to show us a few smiles.`
`Of course, we have been careful to not bring up Satoko or Rika-chan, and especially Shion...`
`The police later conducted an on-site investigation at the Sonozaki House's underground storehouse, several days after the incident took place. `
`Particularly, the well inside which Satoko and Rika-chan's bodies were disposed of by Shion was carefully surveyed by the prefectural forensic investigators... and true to Shion's testimony, 'the girls' were discovered.`
`Apparently, sediment had accumulated at the bottom of the well, and hence the discovery had taken several days.`
`Along with Satoko and the other victims, skeletal remains that were several years, even several decades old were found, but it's not like I would know much about that.`
`Even I was once summoned back to that place to assist with the crime scene investigation, but I didn't really help them find anything important...`
`The Sonozaki Family in Okinomiya, in other words, Mion and Shion's parents, came home everyday several times along with many of their followers to formally apologize.`
`And no matter how much my parents refused, they kept piling up bank notes worth millions of yen as compensation.`
`And once that money had piled up and reached a certain amount... on the same day, there came an envelope with a letter instead.`
`I have no idea what was written in that letter.`
`But, my parents had discussed amongst themselves for two nights straight without consulting me... and decided we would move away from Hinamizawa.`
`"...I see.`
` You're moving away, huh?`
` ...When are you going?"`
`"The end of next month.`
` In the end, I guess I wasn't able to stay in Hinamizawa for even six months."`
`"...It's going to be lonely around here.`
` Even Mii-chan would be sad, you know?"`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I don't know if I should talk to Mion about this or not... I feel lost."`
`Once Rena had heard me say that, she strongly insisted, "I had to tell her, no matter what."`
`"I'm sure you may feel it's an awful thing to tell her,`
` but I'm sure Mii-chan will be more hurt if you quietly disappear without letting her know.`
` So... how about we go tell her together? Okay?"`
`"...`
` Yeah, you're right."`
`"...`
` Oh, I see...`
` So Kei-chan's going away from Hinamizawa, huh..."`
`Even though she had heard it from me... Mion whispered those words sadly, but she didn't seem that surprised. Surely, she had mentally prepared herself for this outcome somewhere inside her heart... `
`"...`
` Sorry.`
` But you know what, I plan on returning to Hinamizawa someday.`
` ...I promise."`
`"...It's alright. You don't have to force yourself.`
` Even if you come back, there probably isn't anything good for you here..."`
`"...Mii-chan."`
`Both Rena and I wanted to say it wasn't so.`
`But... after such a tragic incident, what verbal consolation could we offer that would help... to Mion who had suffered a much greater pain than we ever had?`
`And so we just stood there... unable to say anything, just wallowing in silence.`
`"Maybe I should just go to Tokyo as well."`
`"...huh?"`
`"I heard I'll be discharged from the hospital next week... and there isn't anything much for me around here either.`
`Even if it isn't Tokyo, I just want it to be somewhere far away... where nobody knows about me, nor Hinamizawa.`
`I'm not really thinking about something convenient like 'starting over'... I'm just exhausted.`
` I just want to throw everything away. Ahaha..."`
`"Mion..."`
`Mion had been forced to carry the name of the next head of the Sonozaki family and the representative of the Three Great Families, all due to a small misunderstanding.`
`Despite feeling uncertain and weary about her unplanned responsibility, she had nevertheless been earnest and given her all to fulfill her duties.`
`But to think, all of that had been concluded in such a manner...`
`It was such a tremendous loss that it's almost a surprise she hasn't completely lost her mind.`
`Who can really blame Mion anymore for making such a faint-hearted remark...?`
`.........`
`And so I...`
`...wanted to devote even a little bit of my remaining time here, for her.`
`"...`
` That's right, Mion.`
` You wanna go out somewhere together?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ...W...where?"`
`"You know, like a trip or something.`
` I don't have a lot of time left here, so I thought we should at least recover some good memories.`
`Tokyo's... kinda far away, but how about another big city, where we could try some good food and do some shopping?`
` ...Well?"`
`"W...Well, I don't know..."`
`"...Yeah!`
` I think that sounds wonderful!`
` You should go, Mii-chan. Okay?"`
`"B-But...`
` wait, Rena... aren't you coming with us?"`
`After hearing that, even I grow puzzled.`
`Hadn't I suggested all three of us hang out together...?`
`"Ahahaha!`
` Well, I don't really want to be the third wheel.`
` So you two should go all by yourselves♪`
` Ah, I'll be looking forward to souvenirs. Hau～☆"`
`"～～?!"`
`Boom~! Mion blushes vigorously.`
`I was slow to react because I didn't understand what Rena was getting at... but seeing Mion's face imbued with color after a long time, my heartbeat grew faster for a moment.`
`No... it wasn't what I implied when I suggested the idea, but depending on the point of view, wouldn't this be an invitation to a date?`
`(No, I'm probably getting way ahead of myself...)`
`Indeed, after seeing it that way, I was overcome with embarrassment... but there was no way I could back out after coming this far.`
`Gah, this was all for Mion's sake! Pull yourself together, Keiichi Maebara!!`
`"Erm... well how about it, Mion?`
` Ah, of course it'll be after getting permission from the doctor and your parents.`
` I'll make sure you don't tire yourself out... so think about it, okay?"`
`"...Uh... ummm.`
` O-okay... I-I gotcha....`
` I-I'll, uh, think about it... okay...?"`
`"Hauu～ Mii-chan looks so kyute today for a change!`
` I'm so happy, I'm so happy! Hau hau, hauuuuuu~!☆"`
`.........`
`After that, we spent the day talking about harmless stuff that happened at school or in the neighbourhood until it was evening.`
`I felt like Mion had regained some of her spirit and acted a bit like she used to, so I was happy.`
`After a few days, Mion had contacted me to say she was okay with my plan.`
`And after spending a few more days to convince my folks and Mion's parents, we set off on a day's trip to a metropolis that had one of those bullet train stations.`
`"...Woah~!`
` I haven't been here in a while, but it's grown so much!"`
`As soon as she stepped out of the station, Mion set eyes on a scenery sprawling with people and cars. She shared her feelings in excitement as she looked on admiringly.`
`From what I heard, unless it's on very important business, Mion rarely gets to leave the village... let alone come out to a big city like this.`
`Because of that, everything she saw looked fresh and fascinating to her, and she pranced around merrily, almost like a child.`
`"Hey, hey, Kei-chan?`
` ...Where are we going after this?"`
`"Let's see...`
` judging by your preferences... how about there?"`
`The place I was pointing to—one I had checked out in advance—was a massive beautifully decorated game arcade that towered over a corner of the station shopping square. `
`"...Phew~!`
` We sure had one hell of a time, huh?"`
`"Aha ha ha ha, I had so much fun!`
` It's been a long time since I played so many games at once!"`
`As I sat down on the bench, Mion was gleefully draining her can of juice with a huge smile.`
`That expression was unlike the gloomy one Mion had worn at the hospital—next to me was the Mion I knew well.`
`Earlier, we'd had a blast, vowing to conquer all the game consoles in the vicinity and made quite the ruckus, without caring about the people watching.`
`Mion was enjoying herself playing on consoles she wasn't used to, and had gone on a rampage; laughing out loud, getting worked up and challenging me to matches.`
`"......"`
`Although, I couldn't help thinking about "what ifs" as I was playing with her.`
`About how much fun it would've been if only it weren't just the two of us, but also Rena, Satoko and Rika-chan as well.`
`I'm sure Mion must've been thinking the same thing. Which was also why I outdid myself, making so much noise, trying to battle the loneliness... when I had realized.`
`"Hey, Mion."`
`"Mm? What's up, Kei-chan?"`
`With faint drops of sweat coating her forehead, Mion turned to face me with a broad smile.`
`...Mion's cheerfulness was most likely just her being considerate towards me for having brought her here. If that was so, then I needed to do the same for her.`
`"You told me it was your first time seeing those, but were you serious?`
` You got two highscores on your first time playing, you're unbelievable!"`
`"Tsk tsk tsk. That was actually four, Kei-chan!`
` These games are all about sense, intuition and having great eyesight!`
` It's all thanks to never neglecting my everyday discipline!`
`More importantly, Kei-chan, shouldn't you be feeling ashamed of having your advantage used against you?"`
`"Hey, woah, hold it right there!`
` Remember how you distracted me by randomly pointing somewhere during air hockey and saying, 'Look, what's that?'. That's against the rules!`
` You're goddamn brutal!"`
`"Ah ha ha ha!`
` Winner takes all, losers gotta fall, right~?"`
`...For the time being, it's alright if her well-being is a front.`
`All I hope for is that someday, this becomes real and she recovers her old cheerful self...`
`"Speaking of which, the game arcade's changed quite a bit, huh.`
` A little while ago, I would've expected a dim place stinking of cigarettes, but I'm surprised I got to see so many people there with their families."`
`"You're right.`
` I guess hanging out like this once is a while is pretty fun too!`
` ...Oh yeah, what time is it now?"`
`"Ummm... it's around 5PM now, I guess?"`
`"Oh—! Then it's not long before we have dinner, right?`
` Where do you want to go before we leave?"`
`"Hmmm.`
` How about fast food, like hamburgers or something?"`
`"Oh, sounds nice.`
` ...Ah, before we go, just excuse me for bit."`
`Mion said that and stood up from the bench. I found it odd for a minute, but then I understood her intention and...`
`"They'll have toilets at the restaurants too, you know...?`
` ...ughmpf?!"`
`Instead of a reply, I had empty cans thrown at me. Mion stuck her tongue out at me and left in a hurry... and after I watched her retreating figure, I plopped back down on the bench and looked up at the sky.`
`"*sigh*"`
`The sky was pure blue and crystal clear, and it felt amazing. Everything seemed to be glowing, bathed in the brilliant summer sun.`
`It was a good thing we came here. Mion also seemed to show signs of recovery.`
`"...Oh yeah.`
` Then I might as well try asking her if she wants to come see me at Tokyo next time."`
`It would be cheaper if she stayed at our new place there, but I feel like our parents may be concerned for a while. We still needed some more time to go back to how it was.`
`"Ah, then I'll have to look for a place she can stay at.`
` After that..."`
`......Why hello there.`
`"Eh?`
` Oh, hello... Wha....., ..."`
`.........`
`"Hey... I'm so sorry, Kei-chan.`
` The line for the toilet was really long~!`
` Look, I bought some drinks because I made you wait so long.`
` Which one would you like?"`
`.........`
`"...My my, Kei-chan, don't tell me you fell asleep?`
` Wow, this is pathetic.`
` It's not very gentlemanly to doze off on a date with a girl, you know~."`
`.........`
`"Kei-chan?`
` ...Seriously, how long are you going to be out?`
` Come on, wake up!"`
`"...Kei-chan?`
` Eh... Ah-?!"`
`.........`
`"N-Nooooooooooooo!!"`
