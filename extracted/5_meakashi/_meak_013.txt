`I woke up.`
`...My memories were missing. I couldn't remember how I got back to my room...`
` I held my head with both hands.`
`My left hand was bandaged.`
`The fingers that had their nails removed had swollen like hotdogs.`
`...I'd paid with those three fingernails for what I did.`
`The hag had said something after the punishment, but I didn't remember any of it.`
`I was taken to a hospital in Okinomiya.`
`The car shook on the way, adding extra pain on top of what I already felt.`
`...Somebody gave me some aspirin.`
`They worked just like they said on TV...`
`but they didn't last more than ten minutes...`
` I swallowed the pills without water.`
`...While I was spacing out in the waiting lounge...`
` ......Kasai showed up.`
`He probably came to check if I was all right.`
`I obviously wasn't. He must've understood that from my bandaged left arm dangling from my shoulder.`
`Kasai, on the other hand, looked just fine.`
`...At least on the outside.`
`...I was relieved that my sacrifice had meant something.`
`Kasai didn't say anything.`
`......I couldn't tell if he wanted to tell me something or not, because he looked so emotionless.`
`".....................Kasai."`
`".........Yes?"`
`"....................."`
`He paused shortly before answering. I could tell he was upset.`
`...I didn't regret revealing my true identity in order to protect Satoshi-kun.`
`But... I hadn't wanted Kasai or Uncle Yoshiroh to be hurt...... I had been contradicting myself.`
`"......Do you know how Uncle Yoshiroh is doing...?"`
`"No."`
`"....................."`
`"...I'm sure he's all right,`
` because he's strong.`
` Even so, you should apologize to him."`
`"..............................Okay..."`
`...I wanted to ask him about Satoshi-kun, too.`
`I wondered if he was captured or harassed by the Sonozaki family because of me.`
`But... I was hesitant to ask Kasai...`
`After all, I'd chosen Satoshi-kun over them...`
`...Was Satoshi-kun all right?`
`I hoped he wouldn't get caught or incarcerated somewhere...`
`...I paid the hospital bill, and Kasai gave me a ride home...`
`...I finally realized that somebody was knocking on my door.`
`"Shion-san...`
` it's not healthy to sleep so much."`
`It was Kasai.`
`He put some side dishes on the table, and we started nibbling at them...`
`"....How do you feel?"`
`"...Depressed...`
` Hah..."`
`"Have you been resting?`
` Have you been eating?"`
`"...I've been eating the stuff left in the fridge.`
` Otherwise, I've been either sleeping or staring at the ceiling."`
`It had been three days...`
` I'd just been lying down since then.`
`I woke up every now and then in my shallow sleep, but I didn't feel like getting up or thinking. I felt like I'd just been floating the whole time.`
`My appetite was gone, but it came back with the smell of the food Kasai brought.`
`I wasn't able to think of anything to talk to Kasai about... so I just ate silently.`
`"I got a call from Mion-san yesterday......`
` She was saying she called you a few times, but never got through."`
`The moment I heard Mion's name... I felt my wounds throb.`
`But I didn't stop Kasai, who continued.`
`".........They're finally acknowledging my right to make my own decisions, huh...?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` They said you could live as yourself now... under a few conditions.`
` You will stay away from Hinamizawa,`
` you won't pretend to be Mion Sonozaki, `
`you won't show up in public places... and so on. This means..."`
`"In exchange for acknowledging me, they don't want me to hang around."`
`"That's correct...`
` Of course, it is only temporary`
` until things cool down.`
` There is no set duration, but I think you should stay inconspicuous at least until the end of the year."`
`"...It'd be good enough just to live in Okinomiya quietly...`
` the way it was before."`
`Kasai put on a sad smile.`
`I smiled back at him likewise.`
`Before the conversation ended... I should ask him what I wanted to know.`
`".........How's Satoshi-kun`
` doing......?"`
`"....................."`
`I wished that Kasai would assure me of his safety right away.`
`But he didn't answer like that.`
`"...Kasai.`
` ...Is he all right...?"`
`"...Shion-san."`
`Kasai put his chopsticks down.`
`"The family wants you to forget about him."`
`".....................`
`What?"`
`"Shion-san.`
` I don't want to get in an argument with you, so I will not get into the details...`
` I'm only relaying to you what the family wants."`
`"Wh-What are you talking about...?`
` What details, Kasai?!"`
`"....................."`
`Kasai pretended as though he didn't hear me and started eating again.`
`...I'd never seen him get so stubborn like this.`
`...The Sonozaki family had been using the Houjou family as a scapegoat.`
`...They must have concluded that a Sonozaki shouldn't be in love with a Houjou.`
`...I didn't like that.`
`...Satoko is a friend of Mion's at school.`
`Would it be okay if Satoshi-kun and I were the same gender?`
`.........Anyway, if I did something conspicuous again, they might do something to him for real.`
`Just like they forced me to remove my own fingernails.`
`...The Sonozaki family wouldn't hesitate...`
` They'd torture him if need be.`
`...Maybe, if I really loved him, I should stay away...`
`Satoshi-kun won't show up in Okinomiya`
` unless he rejoins the Hinamizawa Fighters.`
`I'd have to pretend to be Mion if I wanted to go to Hinamizawa.`
`But... I didn't think she'd cooperate with me.`
`Even if she did, it'd be some time down the road.`
`...Even if they told me not to see him...`
`I already had no means of doing that again.`
`Oh... wait.`
`...Mion gave me his number a little while ago...`
` I could call him...`
` and maybe ask to meet with him secretly.`
`.........But if I got caught again, they wouldn't cut me any slack......`
` Should I risk it? What the hell did I even want from Satoshi-kun...?`
`".....................Kasai.`
` Can I be alone for a moment?"`
`Kasai started putting away his food in a rush, assuming that I wanted him to leave.`
`"Oh, no, that's not what I meant.`
` Take your time and finish your food.`
` I just want to take a walk."`
`"...You can't lock this place up if I don't step out with you."`
`Kasai quickly put away his meal and followed me out.`
`"...Uh, just to be clear, I'm not going out to see Satoshi-kun, all right?"`
`"I see."`
`I turned around and started walking.`
`My destination was... rather pathetic.`
`It was the toy store that sold that giant teddy bear.`
`I couldn't deny that I was somewhat expecting Satoshi-kun to pass by there.`
`I couldn't stop myself from looking at the faces of passersby who resembled him.`
`I looked into the store's window.`
`...The teddy bear was gone.`
`"Congrats, Satoshi-kun......`
` Looks like you were able to buy it."`
`His evil aunt had died and his wicked uncle was living with his mistress.`
`Satoshi-kun succeeded in fulfilling his duty as a big brother by buying his little sister that huge teddy bear.`
`There was nobody left to hurt him.`
`He was free from his tiresome efforts.`
`...He was completely free from pain.`
`Over time, he'd retrieve his smile...`
` and he'd go back to being the Satoshi-kun I love.`
`...............But,`
` I wouldn't be there with him.`
`I heard a car honking.`
`I didn't think it was honking at me at first, but it was so persistent that I had to look up.`
`The person waving at me from their car...`
` was Irie.`
`He was waving at me all carefree, oblivious to my feelings.`
`"Sonozaki-san.`
` Long time no see.`
` Oh, are you meeting up with Houjou-san?"`
`"......No, I'm not."`
`"I know he looks into that store's windows all the time...`
` So I assumed you were expecting him here, or something..."`
`"...No, I'm just passing by.........`
` Looks like he was able to buy that teddy bear."`
`Irie seemed to know about the teddy bear as well.`
`He smiled upon seeing its empty display space.`
`"......Yesterday was Satoko-chan's birthday.`
` He must've celebrated it with that teddy bear."`
`"He doesn't have to work so hard anymore, huh?"`
`"Indeed."`
`"...Did he... turn in his resignation to the Hinamizawa Fighters?"`
`"Oh, does that even exist?`
` I never received one.`
` Did you, Sonozaki-san?"`
`"...Ahahaha. No, I didn't."`
`"So, that means he still belongs to the team.`
` I think he'll be back after things have settled down.`
` But I know he'll be sad if he doesn't see you there."`
`Irie teased me...`
` He's a grownup, after all.`
`He must have been trying to sound optimistic because he knew I was feeling a bit down.`
`"...You can come back to the team anytime you want.`
` It might as well be empty without you.`
` ...I'm thinking of providing you with a maid costume once you come back."`
`I burst into laughter.`
` Irie sure hadn't changed.`
`"...Oh, I almost forgot.`
` I can tell you my name now.`
` Sorry. Coach. I was lying about my identity...`
` I'm not Mion.`
` I'm her twin sister, Shion.`
` I've been pretending to be her for a few reasons."`
`"Eh... what?`
` You're Mion-san's twin... sister?!"`
`He was totally taken aback. I burst into laughter again.`
`"Yes,`
` I am Shion Sonozaki.`
` I'm forced to live quietly because my grandmother hates me, though."`
`"...I never realized...`
` that Mion-san had a twin sister..."`
`"Na ha ha ha. Same here."`
`Suddenly, a loud voice interrupted us.`
`The voice sounded mean and greasy, unlike Irie's.`
`...It was him.`
` Ooishi.`
`"Hello, Dr. Irie.`
` Thank you for your cooperation last night."`
`"Don't mention it. I wasn't of much help."`
`...They were just going through the motions.`
`It was obvious that they hated each other.`
`Irie whispered to me.`
`"......I'm leaving now. Do you want to get in my car?`
` I can drive you home."`
`Irie figured that Ooishi was after me, so he was giving me a chance to slip away.`
`Looking at Ooishi's face, it was clear that his focus was on me, not Irie.`
`...He probably intended to interrogate me until my testimony broke.`
`...I was sure I could talk my way out of it, but it'd just be a waste of time.`
`"All right,`
` Coach.`
` Let's get going."`
`"...Oh, are you two going somewhere together?"`
`"Yes.`
` We're on our way to get some stuff for the team.`
` We have to drop by a few places, so will you excuse us?"`
`Irie bowed. I followed suit.`
`...I had to admire how good he was at lying.`
` He's a grownup, after all.`
`Ooishi seemed to know it was a lie.`
`But he didn't have a warrant, so he couldn't stop us. I moved to get into Irie's car.`
`"...How are your wounds,`
` Shion Sonozaki-san?"`
`I gasped when I heard that.`
`...My left hand was bandaged.`
`...It was unsightly, so I'd kept it in my pocket.`
`There was no way Ooishi could have been able to see it.`
`"They'll heal with no problems if they don't get infected.`
` I tore my fingernails off a couple of times myself when I was a kid. But look, they look beautiful now, don't they?`
` Nfu fu fu."`
`"......Men's fingernails shouldn't look beautiful. That gives me the creeps."`
`Ooishi scratched his head and chuckled.`
`...He's supposed to be one of the best cops at the Okinomiya PD, and he knows about all the underground activities in the region.`
`He must've heard about my payment from somewhere...`
`...Still, that happened in the secret basement of the Sonozaki main house...`
`I couldn't underestimate this guy's sources.`
`"Thank you for your kind words...`
` We'll be going now.`
` Excuse us."`
`"Shion Sonozaki-san.`
` Why don't we get coffee together sometime?"`
`"...What?`
` Are you hitting on me?"`
`"If you like.`
` Nfu fu fu."`
`"Sorry.`
` Time flies.`
` I can't waste any of that precious time on things that don't interest me."`
`"Ah... you got me there...`
` How about this, then?`
` You can leave anytime if you get bored of talking to me.`
` I won't stop you.`
` How does that sound?"`
`"...I don't mind you talking, but I won't talk back.`
` I doubt you could call it a conversation."`
`"Yes, that'd be fine.`
` You can just listen`
` and I'll talk...`
` You can just listen to an old man ramble while sipping on a cup of coffee."`
`...He was being strangely persistent.`
`It didn't look like he was trying to poke a hole in my statement.`
`What would he even talk about?`
` I got a bit curious, even though I was still skeptical.`
`"...Coach.`
` I think I'll go with the old man instead."`
`"Mio... I mean, Shion-san......?"`
`I winked at him and told him not to worry.`
`...Irie didn't insist. He got in his car and drove off.`
`Ooishi backed his car up so I could get in.`
`I hopped in the back seat, since I didn't want to sit next to him.`
`"...Are we really going to a cafe?"`
`"Hmm... if you could direct me to one with no connection to your family, that'd be great."`
`"Tssk...`
` Why don't you just take me to the station, then?"`
`Ooishi carefully checked for oncoming traffic, and then started driving.`
`Ooishi took me to the police station, as I thought he might.`
`...If he had taken me to a nice cafe, he would've scored some points...`
` but whatever.`
`"I thought it'd be more convenient if we came here...`
` you can still go home if you get bored."`
`"......Humph, try your best not to bore me, then...`
` Do you want me to go into the station hand in hand with you?"`
`Ooishi chuckled and got out of the car. He escorted me inside the station...`
`I thought he'd take me to an interrogation room, but instead he took me to an office of the investigation division.`
`...Officers in both suits and uniforms were working at their desks, answering phones.`
`There was a desk with a plate that said "section manager," and nearby there were couches and a table.`
`Ooishi told me to sit on the couch, and started making some instant coffee.`
`I'd never been to this part of the police station. I looked around in curiosity.`
`"Did you think I'd take you to an interrogation room?"`
`Ooishi brought over a tray with coffee cups on it.`
`"My tastes don't run that way.`
` Na ha ha ha ha."`
`"So?`
` I thought you wanted to talk."`
`"All right. I'll cut to the chase.`
` Are you in love with Satoshi Houjou-san?"`
`"...What?`
` It's getting boring already. I'm going home."`
`"Na ha ha ha ha... okay, please forget that."`
`...Ooishi must have known why I had to remove my fingernails.`
`He wasn't trying to confirm that I liked Satoshi-kun. What he was really saying was that he knew already.`
`"...I already talked to Detective Kumagai about Satoshi-kun's alibi that day."`
`"Of course, I read Kuma-cha... I mean, Kumagai-kun's report.`
` I know you were with him."`
`"I'll just repeat the same statement no matter how many times you ask.`
` Don't think you can poke holes in it."`
`"No, no. That's not what I want.`
` You're a smart person.`
` I know that wouldn't work for you."`
`"I wonder what you're after.`
` You're wasting your time if you want information on Satoshi-kun.`
` There's nothing more to talk about.`
` Ah, this is boring me after all.`
` I'm going home,`
` since that was our agreement. `
`Excuse me."`
`I got up off the couch.`
`"Shion-san.`
` I did want to get Satoshi-san's alibi from you.`
` I admit it."`
`"...That's it, then.`
` It's boring.`
` I'm going home."`
`I turned around and started walking.`
`Ooishi didn't get anxious, but instead spoke a little louder.`
`"But Shion-san,`
` what I want to ask you about is his alibi for yesterday,`
` not the day of the murder."`
`"His alibi for yesterday...? Why?`
` What does that have to do with his aunt's death?"`
`"It's because Satoshi-kun has been missing since then."`
`...What?`
`"...Didn't you know that he went missing?"`
`"....................."`
`I couldn't say anything, but my expression answered Ooishi's question anyway.`
`"What's going on...?`
` Missing...? What?"`
`"Why don't you take a seat?"`
`"What do you mean, Satoshi-kun has gone missing...?!`
` What the hell?!"`
`"We only know one thing for sure. He withdrew all of his savings at an ATM in the Okinomiya post office before 3 PM yesterday.`
` We don't know his whereabouts after that."`
`I knew why he withdrew that money.`
`He wanted to buy Satoko's birthday present.`
`...Yes, he definitely bought that teddy bear yesterday.`
`"...This is just my guess,`
` but... I think he skipped town with that money."`
`"You mean he used the money to run away?`
` That's stupid.`
` He was saving to buy Satoko a birthday present.`
` He bought a big expensive teddy bear from that toy store.`
` He'd never use that money to skip town."`
`"Yes, the most expensive teddy bear in that toy store was sold.`
` But we can't confirm that it was Satoshi-kun who bought it."`
`"Why don't you ask the clerk?!`
` Satoshi-kun and I reserved that teddy bear together!`
` ...Oh..."`
`I had a bad feeling.`
`......That old man who was watching that store was sleeping when we were there.`
` He'd looked very senile.`
`...Maybe he was also watching that store on that day and...`
` even though Satoshi-kun bought the teddy bear,`
` he didn't remember...`
`Ooishi put on a wry smile.`
`...It looked like he'd already tried to question that old man.`
`"A-Anyway!!`
` It's Satoshi-kun who bought that teddy bear!`
` He must've saved just enough to buy it,`
` so he shouldn't have been able to run away after!`
` That's nonsense!"`
`"All right.`
` Let's say he really did buy the teddy bear,`
` then why didn't he come home with it?"`
`At that point...`
` I felt as though my heart had turned to ice.`
`Satoshi-kun had been working hard to buy that teddy bear even though he was under extreme mental and physical stress.`
`After all that, he finally managed to buy it.`
`It's unthinkable that somebody else just showed up and bought the same teddy bear!`
`The teddy bear was gone because Satoshi-kun bought it!`
`Nobody else!`
`But if so...`
`...Satoshi-kun should've given it to Satoko.`
`But...... though he bought a present for her...`
` he didn't come home.`
`He didn't come home?`
`That wasn't possible.`
`He would've gone straight home with that teddy bear.`
`He wouldn't think of running away after buying the teddy bear.`
`Even though Satoshi-kun wanted to run away from the police......`
`He'd never leave without giving Satoko her present.`
`Anyway, it must have been Satoshi-kun who bought that teddy bear!`
` I can say that with one-hundred-percent certainty.`
`The question was--why didn't he bring it home?`
`That teddy bear was huge.`
`It wouldn't fit into the basket of a bicycle.`
`He might've brought some straps to tie it to his bike.`
`He wouldn't have thought of running away on a wobbly bicycle like that.`
`He necessarily had to go home after buying the teddy bear from the store after withdrawing the money.`
`Nothing could have happened when he was going between the ATM and the toy store!`
` It was impossible!!`
` Nobody else could possibly have bought that teddy bear!!!`
` Never!`
`That teddy bear had been sitting in the showcase up until that day.`
`Everybody could see it when they passed by.`
`But nobody wanted it!`
`It's impossible that it could've been somebody else!!!`
`There should be no question that he went to the toy store after he withdrew the money.`
`What about the route between the toy store and his home?`
`There shouldn't be any question there either.`
`He shouldn't have been able to do anything with that huge toy.`
`He shouldn't even have thought of making a stop on the way!`
`So he must've headed home`
` right after he bought the teddy bear!!`
`But... nobody saw him after that.`
`It was simple, then.`
` Satoshi-kun went missing on his way home from the toy store.`
`He went missing?`
` What did that mean...?`
`I was sure he killed his aunt.`
`He's not that shrewd.`
`Maybe he couldn't bear the pressure from the police?`
`Was he resigned to the idea that the police were going to arrest him soon, regardless of my help?`
`Did he decide to run away?`
`Did he think that he should disappear until things cooled down, rather than get arrested?`
`That was, definitely, absolutely impossible!!!`
`It was impossible that he came to that conclusion on his way home from the toy store!!!`
`Even if he did, he would've waited until he gave Satoko her birthday present.`
`Satoshi-kun loved Satoko.`
`He shouldn't have spoiled her like that, but anyway, he always tried to be a good brother to her.`
`So he'd never disappear before going home!!`
`I felt as though the ice was cutting through my heart, expanding the frost.`
`If Satoshi-kun didn't disappear by his own will...`
`The answer was simple.`
`Satoshi-kun disappeared by somebody else's will.`
`"Was Satoshi-kun...... eliminated......?`
` Aha...... ahahahahahaahahahahaha!!`
` Th-That's really stupid, old man.`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`I thought I could shake off the frost in my heart if I laughed loudly enough.`
`I kept laughing until it happened.`
` I kept laughing.`
` And laughing.`
`All the cops in the room stared at me.`
`They thought I'd gone crazy.`
`I didn't care what they thought...`
` I kept laughing until it turned into a cough...`
`"Ahahahahaha...... ahahahaha, huff!`
` Cough, cough!`
` Coff!!"`
`...I finished laughing, and took a sip of lukewarm coffee.`
`I felt as though the frost in my heart had spread all throughout my guts. I was chilled to the bone.`
`I was freezing...... my fingers shook as I held the coffee cup.`
`"Shion-san.`
` Please listen to me without interrupting.`
` What I'm about to tell you is only a hypothesis.`
` It's all just a theory.`
` You might start laughing in the middle, because it may sound ridiculous. `
`But I want you to hear me out.`
` ...Can you do that?"`
`"Wh-Whatever... Just talk..."`
`I was feeling far too cold... My teeth were chattering.`
`I felt as though my brain had frozen as well... I lost my ability to think.`
`...I couldn't do anything by myself.`
` I could only do as Ooishi told me...`
`What he was going to tell me might be the worst possible theory.`
`But I had to listen to it.`
`"...I know that Satoshi-kun's and Satoko-san's aunt was abusing them,`
` especially Satoko-san......`
`In my opinion, it's normal that Satoshi-kun started thinking about murdering his aunt,`
` because he was just a human being..."`
`I had to deny that Satoshi-kun murdered her.`
`...But what Ooishi was saying was true...`
`I couldn't deny his hypothesis right away... I just kept silent.`
`"...This is only a hypothesis, all right?!`
` Please don't be upset!`
` And no interruptions!`
` Agreed?!"`
`"I-I know...!`
` Just go on!!"`
`"Satoshi Houjou planned the murder of his aunt and executed it.`
` We have no proof, okay?!`
` It's all theoretical."`
`"All right!`
` I heard!`
` Just keep talking...!!"`
`"I'll switch the subject now...`
` Shion-san,`
` you were forbidden from having a relationship with Satoshi-kun, weren't you?`
` They told you to stay away from him, correct? `
`I believe the reason behind that is... not that your family hated the Houjous, but... that they didn't like the fact that you were involved with a murder suspect."`
`...That is... actually possible.`
`After all, when I was pretending to be Mion, I already had a connection with Satoshi-kun...`
`...before anyone knew it was Shion who was spending time around him.`
`I could've been accused when I was helping out the Hinamizawa Fighters if the relationship between the Houjous and the Sonozakis was the problem.`
`It wouldn't be difficult for the Sonozaki family to know that Satoshi-kun murdered his aunt, if it happened in Hinamizawa.`
`Maybe one of them even saw the murder.`
`The Sonozaki family didn't like that I was in love with a murderer. They decided to step in...`
`"Also... you're known to not give up easily, aren't you?`
` Which means, even if the Sonozaki family threatened you or ripped off your nails,`
` you still wouldn't cut ties with Satoshi-kun, would you?"`
`I couldn't deny that.`
`I lost most of my means to access Hinamizawa, so my ties to Satoshi-kun were essentially cut, true.`
`But I still knew Satoshi-kun's phone number, and I expected him to rejoin the Hinamizawa Fighters eventually.`
`"I believe your family knew that a few threats would never be enough for you to break ties with Satoshi-kun.`
` They could threaten you all they liked to no avail. `
`So... their only option would be to do something about the other person, wouldn't it...?"`
`"Wh-Wh-What do you mean, 'do something'?!?!`
` What would they do?!!!`
` What?!!`
` What?!!!!!"`
`If threatening me was useless, then...`
` ...they'd do something about Satoshi-kun.`
`What would they have done?!?!`
`If they pulled something, then wouldn't that interrupt his path from the toy store to home?!`
`Toy store to home!!`
`Toy store to X to home!!!`
`What's X?! What is X?!`
`X marks the spot where his path was interrupted.`
` But what interrupted it?!`
`Why couldn't Satoshi-kun make it home from the toy store if something interrupted him?!?!`
`Why why why?!?!`
` What's X?!!`
` X!!!`
`I ran out of air, became dizzy, and then collapsed.`
`...The floor felt cold.`
`...I felt no pain. I had fallen to the floor like a plastic doll.`
`Ooishi and some others rushed over to me and helped me up.`
`"Calm down, Shion-san...`
` We're not certain that Satoshi-kun was killed yet."`
`You're not certain he was killed?!`
`What the fuck are you talking about?!`
`Don't you know about that torture room where they forced me to rip off my fingernails?!`
`Don't you know that they say there are prison cells and a well for disposing of corpses in the back?!!`
`If the Sonozaki family wants to eliminate somebody, they'd definitely kill them in that torture room and dump the body down there!!!`
`You're not certain?!`
` Are you dumb?`
` Is your brain made of tofu?!`
` If I were in the hag's position, I'd kill him for sure!!!`
` I wouldn't let him get away!! If I would kill him, then the hag would definitely kill him!!!`
`"Shion-san, please calm down.`
` This is unconfirmed, but I have information that somebody witnessed a young runaway male at Nagoya Station,`
` who took a train from there to Tokyo. `
`The clothes didn't match, but it is possible that he changed what he was wearing to hide from the police.`
` It's still possible that it was him."`
`"...I-Is he... alive?!`
` Is he...?!"`
`"This is also a theory, but let me go on.`
` Your twin sister Mion-san...`
` is the closest person to Oryou Sonozaki, correct?`
`I'm assuming that Mion-san stopped Oryou`
` when she suggested murdering Satoshi-kun furtively."`
`...Mion?`
` ...That was possible.`
`She could've tried to calm things down out of pity for me.`
`That idiot was always so indecisive.`
`She should have been clear on if she wanted to save him or not!!`
`But she probably seemed vague about that.`
` She must've persuaded the hag to reduce the punishment to banishment instead of death, just to avoid feeling guilty.`
`"I believe that the Sonozaki family contacted Satoshi-kun.`
` They probably told him that they couldn't cover up the murder, and told him to disappear somewhere far away...`
` They forced him to, to be more accurate."`
`"Satoshi-kun would've rejected that.`
` He would never leave Satoko behind!!"`
`"I agree with you...`
` Satoshi-kun was working at the places Mion-san referred him to, wasn't he?`
` So, the family knew that he had enough money for a getaway."`
`"But he'd never use it for anything other than buying that teddy bear."`
`"You're right.`
` He must've gone straight to the toy store after he withdrew the money.`
`But...`
` what if the teddy bear was already sold when he got there...?"`
`That would've been...... a very desolate situation.`
`He'd been working hard.`
`...While his aunt abused him, he worked at many different jobs...`
`...The money was worth all that pain.`
`He went to the toy store with that money in order to buy his beloved sister a present. That was the only purpose for that money.`
`He must've looked for the teddy bear as he'd always done.`
`But... it was gone.`
`He wouldn't have gone into a panic right away.`
`...Because he was always so optimistic.`
`...He might've thought the store was wrapping the gift for him, because he told them that he'd pick it up that day.`
`...He must've gone into the store joyously.`
`...I couldn't guess exactly what happened next.`
`My heart would tear up if I tried to imagine it, anyway.`
`Why didn't they have it,`
` even though he had it reserved?`
`Did that old man understand the situation, or was he just zoning out...?`
`......Maybe it would have been the same even if it wasn't that old man who was at the store at that time.`
`If a bunch of fierce-looking subordinates from the Sonozaki family went in and showed them the money, nobody could've rejected it.`
`Satoshi-kun must've sunk into silence.`
`...No matter how hard he complained, the teddy bear was gone.`
`......He probably`
` never even considered that his dream might be taken away.`
`He must've been wobbling his way home in sorrow,`
` leaning on the telephone poles every now and then...`
`It was the day he wanted Satoko to be happy the most.`
`He couldn't get the present she wanted the most.`
`He probably didn't think of getting another gift...`
` because it was unimaginable that he couldn't get that teddy bear.`
`He might've imagined how Satoko would react when she found out he had no present for her.`
`......He must've looked unbelievably sad...... and empty.`
`The money he'd been saving`
` meant nothing anymore.`
`Satoshi-kun never cried, even at his toughest moments.`
`Did he even know how to cry......?`
`It was always Satoko who was crying.`
`...So, Satoshi-kun never learned how to cry, and he grew up that way.`
`Did you know...?`
`...People shed sadness from their hearts with tears...`
`Satoshi-kun wasn't even allowed to do that.`
`Even though his heart was filled with sorrow,`
` he couldn't let it out.`
`"...You insisted he wouldn't leave Satoko-san behind, didn't you?`
` But think...`
` What if the Sonozaki family told him that they'd look after her after his disappearance?"`
`...After Satoshi-kun found out the teddy bear was gone...`
`...All he had left were some crumpled bills.`
`...The family told him it was just a matter of time before the police got to him. They told him to run away.`
` They said they'd take care of Satoko.`
`Satoshi-kun didn't feel like seeing his sister.`
`...He wandered... and found himself at Okinomiya Station......`
`He must've been apologizing to Satoko so many times in his mind.`
`......He swore to come back someday.`
` He headed to Nagoya,`
` and then to Tokyo...`
`But that meant... he's alive.`
`......He's alive.`
`...I should be able to see him again someday.`
`...He must be coming back, so I'll definitely see him again...!`
`"I assume that the Sonozaki family set up some place for him to stay.`
` Satoshi-kun must've gone there."`
`"So... he's safe......`
` He's coming back someday, right...?"`
`Ooishi looked up at the ceiling, and stretched.`
` He didn't answer me.`
`On June 24th, 1982, Satoshi Houjou went missing.`
`There is a possibility that he ran away, as he was the prime suspect of the murder that happened on the 20th of the same month.`
`Allegedly, someone resembling him was seen at Nagoya Station embarking on a train heading to Tokyo. But the truth is unknown.`
`No one has seen him since.`
`As a matter of fact, no one even knows if he's still alive.`
