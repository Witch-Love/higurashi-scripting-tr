`"Welcome!`
` Here's your net and a bowl."`
`"Great!"`
`"Wow... these fish are so active!!`
` They look delicious!"`
`"I could eat this little one raw right here!"`
`Huh...?`
`"What are you saying, Mion-san...?"`
`"Mii-chan... you eat goldfish...?`
` Did you eat the one I gave you last year too...?"`
`"No...! I didn't say that...!!"`
`Sis shook her head hard. She'd turned all red.`
`"But you just said it...`
` You said they look delicious..."`
`"I heard it too.`
` Sis eats everything, as long as it fits inside her mouth."`
`"......If it's really good, I'll try it once."`
`"No, you can't, Rika-chan! You're going to get sick!!"`
`"Wait a minute...`
` Hey, you...`
` How long have you been here... Shion?"`
`"Hi, Kei-chan, Sis, and everyone else!`
` Good evening!"`
`"Aaaaaaah!!`
` When did you get here, Shion?"`
`"I've been here since you were at the chow mein booth. I found you guys quickly since you were making so much noise."`
`"Hey!!`
` You're not in our club!`
` Get lost!"`
`"Don't be mean, Sis.`
` Right,`
` Kei-chan?`
` You're fine if I come with you guys, right?"`
`I took Kei-chan's arm and held it between my breasts.`
` Puff, puff.`
`We were going to have a ball.`
`I went around the booths with Sis and her friends.`
`I joked around and laughed out loud.`
`I teased Kei-chan and Sis too.`
`Kei-chan was at the center of the group, so if I did something to him, it naturally involved everybody else.`
`It looked like Satoshi-kun was having a hard time finding his own spot in the crowd.`
`When I glanced at him in a quiet moment, he smiled and told me to have fun without worrying about him.`
`...If he were tangible, I'd pull his arm to join the crowd...`
` It made me sad that I couldn't do that.`
`I bumped into somebody's shoulder.`
`It was obviously my fault, so I apologized right away.`
`As it turned out, it was somebody I knew.`
`"Oh,`
` looks like you're having fun.`
` Good evening, Shion-chan.`
` The moon looks beautiful tonight, doesn't it?"`
`"......Oh, it's been forever, Takano-san!`
` And you were......"`
`"Nice to meet you.`
` I'm Tomitake.`
` I heard you were Mion-chan's twin sister."`
`"Nice to meet you too, Tomitake-san.`
` I heard you were a great cameraman.`
` Please take a picture of me someday."`
`"Ahahahahaha... I'm just an amateur dreaming of going professional."`
`"Well, you're actually great,`
` Jirou-san.`
` You're good at many things...`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`"No, I need to study more.`
` I have no talent, so I have to put out a lot of effort to compensate."`
`They must've been in a relationship.`
`"You two look so happy together.`
` Am I interrupting you?"`
`"Oh, no.`
` I appreciate your consideration, but you're not interrupting us at all.`
` And... you can call me Miyo like before,`
` not Takano-san."`
`"Aha ha ha ha... It's a bit hard for me to call someone older than me by her first name...`
` Well, never mind."`
`I smiled bashfully, and Takano-san smiled back elegantly.`
`"I haven't seen you in the library since.`
` I wanted to talk to you more, as a fellow researcher."`
`"Ahahaha... well, when I feel like it."`
`"A fellow researcher...? Are you interested in it, too, Shion-chan?`
`I mean... in the legend of this village?"`
`Tomitake-san raised his eyebrows.`
`As far as I knew, Takano-san's hobby wasn't exactly normal.`
`On the surface, her research dealt with the cultural history of ancient Hinamizawa, but its main focus was the 'Watanagashi' festival from ancient times.`
`The cannibal banquet in which they captured and gutted a living sacrifice.`
`Her research covered various stories surrounding that, and other legends of cruelty... It was nothing if not gory.`
`That was where her main interests lay.`
`So, I didn't feel comfortable being called a fellow researcher, to be honest.`
`But objectively speaking, her research notes were fun to read.`
`It was then that I heard the loud booms`
` of the taiko drums.`
`The main event of the Watanagashi festival, the dedication dance, was about to start.`
`According to Takano-san's hypothesis, the part of the dance where the shrine maiden tears open a futon mat represents gutting a living victim.`
`"It's starting.`
` I should head over.`
` Aren't you guys coming to see Rika-chama's performance?"`
`"Hmm?`
` ......Hmm.... Ahahahaha."`
`Tomitake-san looked bewildered......`
` Did that mean he wasn't coming?`
`Takano-san giggled, then whispered in my ear.`
`"To tell you the truth...`
` ...We're thinking of sneaking into the ritual storehouse."`
`".........Eh?"`
`She made it sound like she was going to do something fun...... but it wouldn't be amusing to anyone who knew what the ritual storehouse was.`
`The ritual storehouse, or the storehouse for ritual implements, is sort of a treasure house belonging to the Furude Shrine.`
`I'd heard that Oyashiro-sama's sacred treasures were stored in there.`
`Only people from the Furude family and selected members of the other two Three Families are allowed to enter.`
`...They believe that if other people enter, the place will be desecrated.`
`Everybody in Hinamizawa must've been curious about what was in there when they were kids.`
`But the storehouse was always tightly locked. You couldn't just peek into it either.`
`Kids would get chided if they played around it, so they'd learn to stay away.`
`I didn't like being around it myself, since I was familiar with all that.`
`Even though I didn't believe in curses, I still didn't want to be near it.`
`Nothing good can come from breaking the rules.`
`Were they still going to enter the ritual storehouse despite all that?`
`"...I'm pretty sure it's tightly locked..."`
`"It was, until last year...`
` Rika-chan had the heavy bolt changed to a cheap padlock`
` because the bolt was too heavy for her to lift.`
` Did you know that?"`
`"N-No...`
` but even if it's cheap, it's still locked, isn't it...?"`
`"Jirou-san is very skilled."`
`"Once the Watanagashi ritual starts, everybody will gather around the stage, right?`
` Then the area around this storehouse will be completely devoid of people.`
` Tonight, this place will be a blind spot. `
`Can't see the forest for the trees, I suppose."`
`According to her hypothesis, the ancient tools used for human dissection and torture would be found in the ritual storehouse.`
`"Why don't you join us in a bit?`
` It's now or never.`
` Hee hee hee hee.`
` So, maybe I'll see you then."`
`"Takano-san, what are you telling her?"`
`"Just girl talk.`
` Let's go to some dark place for a quick date.`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ahahahahahaha..."`
`Takano-san walked against the flow of the crowd alongside Tomitake-san.`
`...The ritual storehouse, huh?`
` It was supposedly filled with torture tools...`
`Considering what they had in the underground torture room at the Sonozaki house... that's quite possible.`
`......Satoshi-kun fell victim to the curse in the fourth year.`
`His aunt's death was the sign of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`...Satoshi-kun was the sacrifice to pacify Oyashiro-sama's anger.`
`.........That was what Takano-san said last year.`
`It was just her hypothesis.`
`...At present, I wanted to deny her hypothesis because I wanted to believe that Satoshi-kun was still alive.`
`If her hypothesis was correct,`
` either some religious fanatic or somebody from the Three Families must be imitating the curse in order to revive the ancient custom of Onigafuchi.`
`That would mean that it was them who killed Satoshi-kun.`
`......So what if...`
`What if the ritual storehouse was filled with garbage instead of torture implements?`
`Maybe it was filled with broken palanquins, or freshly painted signboards for the festival.`
`What then...?`
`It wasn't really hard for me to believe`
`......`
` that it was filled with the chemical smell of paint.`
`Maybe I'll get to deny the hypothesis that Satoshi-kun was sacrificed by seeing the inside of the ritual storehouse for myself.`
`...Whatever was in there... it didn't mean that Satoshi-kun would come back.`
`.........`
`"Satoshi-kun... `
` ...What should I do?"`
`Since most people went to see Rika-chama's ritual dance, the festival grounds were deadly quiet.`
`Even so... I couldn't sense Satoshi-kun.`
`Did he go somewhere? Or was I not paying enough attention? `
`...Or maybe he wasn't feeling any emotions in particular?`
`After thinking for a while, I decided to go in with them.`
`It had been almost a year since Satoshi-kun's disappearance.`
`...I'd been avoiding the truth because I was afraid he might be dead.`
`But... now I had a chance.`
`...I had a chance to see the inside of the ritual storehouse.`
`I felt as though something divine had arranged that coincidence.`
`On my way to the storehouse, I noticed Keiichi. He was jumping up and down, trying to see Rika-chama's dedication dance over people's shoulders.`
`If I took him along, we could split the guilt.`
`...Oyashiro-sama might put a curse on me for entering his divine storehouse.`
`I wanted a partner in crime.`
`.....................Since the boy I love disappeared last year because of the curse...`
`...Maybe Mion's love should disappear this year.`
`"......Whoa...... What am I thinking...?"`
`That must've been the demon inside me. I shook the thought out of my head...`
`"What's going on, Shion?`
` Where's the best place to see Rika-chan's dance from? Is it far?"`
`"Huh?`
` I never said I was going to show you that."`
`We made it to the ritual storehouse. Keiichi was baffled by the whole situation.`
`Our timing had been perfect.`
`...I could see Tomitake-san picking the lock...`
`Even though Keiichi must have been curious, he insisted that we shouldn't go in.`
`But I talked him into it anyway. He was quick to change his mind when Tomitake-san joined in.`
`It was completely dark inside, so Takano-san lit a battery-powered lantern. A small entry space appeared before us.`
`"It's so dark in here.`
` Take care not to trip over anything."`
`"I appreciate the concern.`
` ...Okay, doorman, keep a good watch.`
` We're shutting the door now."`
`Takano-san closed the door with a smile, as if leaving Tomitake-san out on purpose.`
`"Man...`
` ...All right, everyone, have fun."`
`As soon as the heavy door was closed, we were surrounded by a quiet darkness.`
`...All we could rely on was Takano-san's lantern.`
`"It'll be fine.`
` It's an outdoor lantern with backup batteries inside.`
` It won't go out or anything."`
`Takano-san teased Keiichi a little.`
`Keiichi, in turn, looked a little pale.`
`He seemed to be able to recognize the sanctity of the building even though he wasn't from Hinamizawa.`
`"Let's go in.`
` ...Here we go... There."`
`After Takano-san opened the heavy inner door, a dusty foul smell flowed out.`
`It was like the smell of a pantry that hadn't been opened in years and the smell of a fish market mixed together... I didn't know exactly how to describe it, but it was a bad smell.`
`From listening to the echo of our footsteps, I could tell that this room was much bigger than the one we were just in.`
`When Takano-san raised her lantern, I could clearly see just how big it was.`
`"Wow...!"`
`At the far side of the wall, there was a statue of some kind of god staring down at us intruders.`
`The way it was lit by the lantern gave it a powerful appearance, and it scared me.`
`"That's the guardian god of Hinamizawa... Oyashiro-sama."`
`...I looked up at the statue, which was holding its religious ornaments.`
`...If Satoshi-kun's disappearance really was a curse...`
`...I couldn't forgive this god.`
`I found myself irritated by the way the statue looked down at me.`
`...Damn you, Oyashiro-sama.`
`...If you really made Satoshi-kun disappear...`
` I'll never forgive you. Never.`
`Keiichi didn't seem to understand the significance of the storehouse. He looked bored.`
`Takano-san noticed that and took out her scrapbooks to show him the brutal history of ancient Hinamizawa.`
`I'd heard that story already... So I decided to walk around by myself.`
`...Since I knew the significance of all these tools, I felt a little nauseated.`
`Though they certainly wouldn't jump out to me, I still found them intimidating.`
` They looked as if they were craving for fresh blood after not having been used in hundreds of years.`
`All the tools looked similar to the ones I saw in the underground torture room at the Sonozaki main house.`
`......If those tools were the progenies of torture implements, these would be their ancestors.`
`All the implements here looked old. I doubted they could really be used.`
`They weren't kept maintained like the ones at the Sonozaki house...`
` So, did that mean they shouldn't scare me...?`
`No, on the contrary...`
`.........They told me that cruel rituals were indeed performed in this village at one point.`
`...Now <i>that</i> I found scary.`
`...What Takano-san told me was the truth.`
`When I stopped, Satoshi-kun also stopped behind me, one step later.`
`...I felt no emotional change in Satoshi-kun.`
`I couldn't tell if he was feeling something or not.`
`...I knew he was there, but I had no idea how he was feeling.`
`...I felt scared of him for the first time.`
`If he could answer me...`
`...I'd want to ask him.`
`...Who demoned you away...?`
`"Hey, Satoshi-kun...`
` ...Are you listening...?"`
`I couldn't tell if he heard me or not.`
`...He left`
` as if he didn't hear anything.`
`I could tell that he'd been sulky ever since we got here.`
`I suddenly felt lonely, so I looked for him while walking around.`
`I realized then that there was an altar in front of the statue.`
`...He might be there.`
`It was a clean altar.`
`An altar ornamented with religious artifacts.`
`It was kept well-maintained. I saw no dust.`
`That would mean... well...`
`The flowers in the vase weren't wilting.`
`...I saw a pretty handkerchief under the vase. It looked out of place amongst everything else.`
`...I was fairly certain it was Rika Furude's handkerchief.`
`That would mean...`
`...That this storehouse is maintained daily.`
`It wasn't a forgotten ruin buried in dust.`
`...So, the brutality that dwelled in this ritual storehouse...`
` is still alive and well in Hinamizawa.`
`That's right.`
` Something as ambiguous as Oyashiro-sama's curse is nothing more than a simple delusion of the villagers.`
`As Takano-san said...`
`"Everything that happens in this world is done by humans."`
`I'd accused Oyashiro-sama of demoning away Satoshi-kun.`
`But Oyashiro-sama is just a statue made of bronze or wood.`
`It's nothing but an icon.`
`...There are, however, human beings who would try to make that icon seem real.`
`The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa is the result of human action...`
` It shouldn't be called 'Oyashiro-sama's curse.'`
`If Satoshi-kun was the fourth year's victim...`
`Then he was victimized by a human being who just was acting the part of a curse.`
`The person who demoned away Satoshi-kun must not be very far from me.`
`...The truth behind Satoshi-kun's disappearance was...... not so far from my grasp...`
`Thump.`
`I was startled by the sound. It sounded like somebody had dropped something. I looked over at Takano-san and Keiichi.`
`Takano-san was still lecturing him.`
`...Did she drop her scrapbook or something...?`
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
` Thump.`
`......The sound came from right behind me, not from them.`
`I'd never heard Satoshi-kun do that.`
`...It sounded like somebody was stomping on the floor in frustration.`
`Wh-What is it...?`
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
` Thump.`
`The sound continued, ignoring my question.`
`Though I heard it right nearby...... it sounded as though a child was hopping on a wooden floor somewhere distant.`
`"......What's wrong, Satoshi-kun......?`
` Are you angry about something......?"`
`I couldn't read his expressions.`
`I thought he was mad, but I didn't sense any emotion from him at all.`
`...Was he mad that I touched the altar...?`
`Maybe you weren't supposed to do that.`
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
` Thump.`
`...It's not that I'd been able to communicate with Satoshi-kun in a concrete way.`
`I just talked to him.`
`...I was never expecting him to react like that.`
`I didn't sense a willingness to communicate from this creepy sound.`
`Then a chill ran up my spine...`
` I felt as if all my pores were opening.`
`I'd been thinking that it was Satoshi-kun stomping on the floor.`
`.........Hey......`
` you.`
`.........You're Satoshi-kun.........`
` aren't you...?`
`...The sound stopped`
` when I asked that.`
`It wasn't a yes or a no. Just silence.`
`...Satoshi-kun wouldn't scare me like that.`
`I realized suddenly that the sound hadn't come from Satoshi-kun.`
`A cold shiver shot through my feet, and I sprung a step backward.`
`The sound had come from right there.`
`...Even though I'd jumped back, it was still just a few meters away.`
`Satoshi-kun would sometimes let me hear his footsteps when I walked.`
`...But ...if that wasn't Satoshi-kun, then... there was no guarantee I'd hear its footsteps.`
`So... that invisible being could already be right in front of my eyes...`
` ...and I just wouldn't see it?!!`
`I forgot everything and ran.`
`Straining my ears as much as possible for any sound.`
` Listening for any footsteps pursuing me.`
`I ran right into Keiichi and clung to him, timidly turning back to look.`
`...The dimly lit area before the altar was quiet, like nothing was happening.`
`But seeing that chilling dark stillness... realizing I was just in that space, made me even more frightened now...`
`"What's up, Shion...?`
` Did you get scared?"`
`Keiichi made fun of me.`
`Even though he'd looked horrified just a little while ago, he now looked satisfied to see me scared too.`
`"Ahahahaha. I know girls tend to get freaked out by haunted houses.`
` Well, I don't mind it.`
` Anyway, let's go.`
` Before Takano-san leaves us behind."`
`I pretended to be fine, but I wasn't sure if I was able to hide my fear entirely.`
`The footsteps were chasing me...`
`They were outside the illumination of the lantern as if they couldn't go into the light.`
`...The presence never left us, however.`
`...It followed us like a fourth member of the party.`
`Sometimes it made a stomping sound as if wanting some recognition.`
`But neither Takano-san nor Keiichi...`
` seemed to notice it.`
`It was possible for Takano-san to be ignoring it.`
`But Keiichi would never ignore it.`
`If he could hear it, he would have said something.`
`So... just like with Satoshi-kun...`
`...Only I could hear it...`
`What was this thing that was making me so scared?`
`Was it Satoshi-kun in a bad mood?`
`Or was it possible that the presence I believed to be Satoshi-kun might not have been him at all?`
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
`...What are you upset about... Satoshi-kun...?`
` Tell me if I did something wrong... I'll apologize...`
`Thump thump!`
` Thump!`
`...If you aren't Satoshi-kun... then where did he go...?`
`When did you take his place...?`
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
` Thump!!`
`"...Shion, are you all right?"`
`"Huh?`
` I'm fine.`
` You look pale, though."`
`"Then I'd appreciate it if you didn't stretch my clothes too much..."`
`"Oh, sorry......"`
`"Oh.`
` Am I interrupting you two?`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`I decided to engage in the conversation to help myself ignore the sound from behind.`
`I didn't hear the sound as much... and it became a bit more distant.`
`Yeah, I shouldn't pay attention to it.`
`It wouldn't bother me if I didn't hear it.`
`...I should just ignore the noise...`
`"Takano-san, you're researching whether those customs survived into the present.`
` ...You are, right?" `
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
`"...What I'm about to tell you is a secret, all right?`
` I told you, Shion-chan, because you're an understanding person, but the other villagers don't want to hear it. `
`...If things go awry, I could be ganged up on and punished."`
`She smiled at me like a witch. `
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
`"Maebara-kun, you keep it a secret too, okay?`
` If this gets out, I could suffer Oyashiro-sama's curse, or be made into a sacrifice. `
`If it's the curse, then I wonder what kind of death it'll be this year? `
`If it's the sacrifice... then will I be thrown into the Onigafuchi Swamp while still alive?`
` ...And it is tonight, you know.`
` The night of Oyashiro-sama's curse."`
`...It certainly is....`
` If the curse strikes for a fifth time, it'll happen tonight. `
`Thump.`
` Thump.`
` Thump!`
`Takano-san pulled out an old scrapbook from her paper bag, and started turning the pages.`
`She opened it to the page with that one article.`
`It was the article about the brutal murder of a Watanagashi victim. It happened in the Meiji Era.`
`"This is a story that actually happened.`
` It was around the end of the Meiji Era.`
` ...They discovered an unknown, mangled corpse, the victim of a murder, in Onigafuchi Village."`
`Thump.`
` Thump-thump-thump-thump!!`
`"...Never before has there been a corpse treated with such cruelty and inhumanity..." `
`Thump-thump-thump!`
`......Hey,`
` you guys seriously don't hear that...?`
`It's freaking loud...... How can you not hear it?`
`Ah... hell... it's freaking noisy... Cut it out already...`
`And the next moment, we all heard a squeaking noise!`
`We turned around in surprise.`
`It was just Tomitake-san opening the door...`
`"Aha ha ha ha.`
` Did I startle you?"`
`"Oh, Jirou-san, could you not resist seeing inside?`
` ...This is a splendid treasure trove of torture devices."`
`"I'll pass on that.`
` Ahahaha...`
` I'm bad with this sort of thing by nature."`
`Takano-san laughed as if making fun of Tomitake-san for being such a scaredy-cat.`
`"In any case.`
` The dance and ceremony are over, and everyone's going down to the river.`
` The festival as a whole will be over within minutes."`
`Time was up.`
`...I'd never expected that Tomitake-san would save me from this nightmare. His face suddenly looked heroic.`
`"Oh?`
` Keiichi-kun, are you leaving too?"`
`"...I've seen enough.`
` ...Shion, you're good too, right?`
` Let's get out of here.`
` ...I want some fresh air."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's leave."`
`I went into the entry room and turned around.`
`Takano-san was taking photos in a mad rush, though our time was up.`
`...I didn't hear that sound anymore.`
`I didn't feel that presence.`
`...I didn't feel Satoshi-kun either...`
` but somehow I wasn't too sad about that.`
`Even if he followed me out here...`
`......I wouldn't be able to tell if it was really him... or somebody else......`
