`Rika Furude.`
`She was the head of the Furude family, but she never even appeared at the most important meetings.`
`Even if she did show up, nobody would ask for her opinion, so it never really mattered if she was there or not.`
`A legend in the Furude family says that if their firstborn child is a girl for eight generations in a row, that eighth girl would be the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama. `
`According to Takano-san's research, Rika Furude is very likely to be the one.`
`Surely, she must be an important icon in the cult of Oyashiro-sama. The true believers are devoted to her.`
`So, it's quite surprising to me that Rika Furude herself was the assassin.`
`It's unbelievable.`
`It's just too abnormal.`
`Usually, a VIP like her wouldn't be the one to assassinate someone.`
`It's possible that... it was a Rika Furude lookalike.`
`From the way she moved, she seemed experienced in fighting.`
`It's not normal that a small girl like her would jump me without faltering.`
`I just got lucky because I had a stun gun.`
`Without it, I don't know what would have happened.`
`She was far more skilled`
` than she looked.`
`Was she trained as an assassin??`
`Or was it a body double?`
`Everything is a mystery, including that creepy syringe.`
` What's going on?`
` I can't understand.`
`She was like`
` an apparition, or something.`
`Did Oryou Sonozaki know of her existence...?`
`What is hiding on the underside of this village?`
`That underside...`
` might run much deeper than I thought.`
