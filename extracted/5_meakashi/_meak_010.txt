`The day of the Watanagashi festival.`
` June 20th, 1982 1:40 PM`
`What was I doing today?`
`Nothing in particular.`
`Nothing at all.`
` I just wanted to play hooky.`
`I woke up in the afternoon.`
`I ate instant food for lunch while watching boring TV programs.`
`I had a light headache, so I lay down on the sofa.`
`I wouldn't wake up again if I went to sleep.`
`...Whatever.`
`I decided to sleep.`
`...I'd already told Sis that Satoshi-kun had asked her to look after Satoko.`
`I didn't have to do anything myself.`
`I fell asleep, though my head was aching a little bit...`
`That would be all I'd have to deal with.`
` June 20th, 1982 5:02 PM`
`The aunt believed that all the villagers frowned upon her because her brother-in-law and his wife were pro-dam activists.`
`She surely experienced some fallout during the time of the dispute.`
`But people had stopped looking coldly upon her, even though she assumed otherwise.`
`She was paranoid, believing that all the villagers hated her.`
`And so, she decided to hate them back.`
`Her attitude, of course, begot hatred from the villagers...`
` and the situation became exactly the way she thought it was from the start.`
`What came first, their poor relationships with the neighbors...`
`Or her husband's affair?`
`...She didn't know, herself.`
`Her husband claimed that he got a lover because he was fed up with her attitude.`
`She, in turn, claimed that their relationships with the neighbors went sour because her husband had damaged their reputation.`
`Only Satoshi was aware that both happened at almost the same time.`
`Their quarrels had become a daily routine now.`
`When the husband came home late, the wife would shout at him at the entrance.`
`Satoshi wondered why they didn't get a divorce, their marriage being as rotten as it was.`
`But he secretly knew the reason for that, too.`
`It was the fortune his parents had left.`
`His aunt had hidden their bankbook and stamp and never allowed her husband access to them.`
`(So, her husband would search the house for them. She'd find out he stole some money from her purse.`
` This would cause yet another fight.)`
`...Satoshi had never been aware that his parents had that much money when they were alive.`
`After their death, however, one of his relatives told him.`
`He was informed that his parents had left a large sum of money in some bank account.`
`Satoshi couldn't understand why they had that kind of money, because his family had been, as far as he knew, poor.`
`It was because of the dam project.`
` His parents probably got the money in return for their cooperation with the government.`
`They had strived to get more villagers on their side, provided information to them, and whatnot.`
`The money was probably compensation for their efforts.`
`His aunt and uncle never had any intention to adopt them until they heard about the money.`
`After someone from some financial institution revealed its existence, they appeared to adopt Satoko and Satoshi.`
`The couple would fight every day.`
`Eventually, Satoshi's uncle started spending more time at his mistress's home.`
`He realized that he had no reason to return to his own home,`
` because he'd just end up in a fight with his wife if he did.`
`When he stopped coming home, Satoshi felt relieved.`
`Neither their uncle nor their aunt treated the two siblings very well.`
` Satoshi's aunt wouldn't have to vent her frustration upon them.`
`The reason the couple fought was their corrupted relationship. So if they separated, there wouldn't be any more fights.`
`Satoshi had thought that at first.`
`But even after they separated, his aunt still had a short temper.`
`Another woman had stolen her husband.`
`The villagers must have been talking behind her back.`
`It was mortifyingly embarrassing.`
`Since she lost an opponent to fight,`
` Satoshi's aunt directed her hatred toward the siblings.`
`Satoshi had been observing her.`
`He learned when she would get upset and how to avoid her attention.`
`He managed to get by without upsetting her, by turning a keen eye to her behavior and avoiding conflicts.`
`...But Satoko couldn't do that.`
`She hated her aunt and didn't even try to hide it.`
`Satoshi told her to behave in their aunt's presence, but her eyes were always filled with hatred.`
`Satoshi strived to reduce the conflict between them as much as possible.`
` He stepped in`
` to mend their relationship.`
`It was a heavy burden for him though, because he was still just a boy.`
`He bore so much.`
` He covered for his little sister`
` by lying,`
` and maneuvering...`
` He tried to maintain a tangible sense of peace.`
`But... he couldn't do that forever.`
`..................The relationship between Satoko and her aunt had already spiraled out of control.`
`Satoshi found something in the trash.`
`...It probably wasn't a legitimate place for trash disposal.`
`...If it was, sanitation workers would come and pick it up.`
`He passed by this street all the time, so he noticed when there were new things dumped there.`
`He'd found a plain-looking desk, of the kind likely to be seen in offices.`
`Somebody must have dumped it within the past few days.`
`His aunt liked to bring usable trash home.`
`She'd had Satoshi help bring a chest home just a few days ago.`
`...If he told her about the desk, she'd want it.`
`His aunt hated to find bugs and garbage in the drawers,`
` so she'd always open them to check before carrying the thing home.`
`Satoshi opened all the drawers...`
` all of which were empty.`
`After that, he turned around and walked for about five steps.`
`He was standing in a knee-high bush.`
`There he laid something he'd been carrying all the time, until today.`
`It'd be very hard to find unless you specifically knew it was there to begin with.`
`...Looking satisfied, Satoshi looked around for some landmark to remember the place by.`
`June 20th, 1982 5:51 PM`
`"Hey, ol' pal!!`
` I see you showed up again this year!`
` You'd better get ready for us!"`
`"Gwa ha ha!`
` You're as peppy as ever!`
` Oh?`
` Is she a newcomer?"`
`"Uh-huh. This is Rena Ryuugu.`
` Don't underestimate her. She's good."`
`"Ahahahaha... No I'm not.`
` Nice to meet you."`
`"Yo! `
`You too!`
` I've brought all kinds of prizes this year!`
` They'll be a real battle to win!!`
` Try and take them all with you if you can!"`
`"......Rena tends to dote on cute stuff."`
`"Yeah, that stuffed animal looks like just her type..."`
`"Wha wha wha?!`
`Hauuu!!`
` Sho kyute!`
` I wanna take it home with me!!"`
`"H-Hey, the booth isn't open yet!! Whooa!!!"`
`"Aha ha ha!!`
` Stop it, Rena.`
` He says the booth isn't open yet.`
` You can run him into the ground once he opens it up!!"`
`"Hauuu, it's mine!`
` I'm taking it home!"`
`Rena lost her marbles over the stuffed animal. Everybody laughed.`
`Everybody except Satoko.`
`She was standing by herself, some distance from the crowd.`
`...Her eyes looked dull.`
`"......Meep~☆."`
`"...Wh-What is it, Rika?"`
`Rika walked up to Satoko,`
` smiling ear to ear in an effort to cheer her up.`
`"...Forget your worries today.`
` Let's just have fun."`
`".................."`
`Satoko looked down.`
`Even if she got to have fun today,`
` her circumstances at home wouldn't change.`
`"......Satoko,`
` your evil aunt isn't around."`
`"I... I know that."`
`"......So, why don't you have fun?`
` Nipah~☆."`
`"....................."`
`"......Nipah~☆."`
`"....................."`
`"......Nipah~☆."`
`"Oh... sorry, but I don't feel like it...`
` Could you please leave me alone...?"`
`"......Why aren't you smiling?"`
`Satoko sulkily glimpsed at Rika.`
`...She gave her a look`
` as though she wanted to say that Rika should know the reason.`
`Even if she could have fun today,`
` nothing would change between her and her evil aunt.`
`No matter how fun the festival was.`
`...Once she went home,`
` her aunt would be there.`
`...The aunt would find something wrong with Satoko, get mad, and shout at her so loudly that the neighbors would hear.`
`How can she have fun, even just for today, while knowing all that?`
`Satoko didn't say that out loud.`
`But her eyes betrayed her emotions to Rika.`
`"......So, Satoko...`
` If your suffering ends today, will you smile?"`
`Satoko gasped.`
`She thought that Rika might do something to help.`
`...But soon after, she realized that Rika was just trying to comfort her.`
`Could her suffering end today?`
` Because of Rika?`
` How?`
`Satoko knew that there was really nothing Rika could do.`
`And so, after just one moment of freedom, Satoko fell into depression again.`
`"Rika...`
` Don't give me false hopes..."`
`"......Satoko."`
`Rika's voice was clearer than Satoko had ever heard before.`
`"...It's already been decided."`
`June 20th, 1982 8:11 PM`
`Satoshi snuck out the window after supper.`
`He heard the distant ruckus of the festival.`
`The festival would end at 9:00 PM.`
`After the Watanagashi ceremony, there was going to be a raffle drawing.`
`So, there were two types of people in Hinamizawa.`
` The people who would go home for dinner, and the ones who would stay until the raffle was over.`
`Either relaxing at home or still at the festival.`
`There were only those two patterns.`
`On top of that,`
` there weren't many neighbors in the vicinity of Satoshi's house.`
`As a result, he found nobody on the streets.`
`...On that night, the small village seemed especially desolate.`
`Satoshi knew it was going to be like this.`
`But he would keep worrying until he saw it for himself.`
`He was barefooted, but started running without hesitation.`
`...He felt as though he'd become a wild animal, running on his bare feet.`
`He got the impression that he could run faster than usual.`
`Not only his running ability.`
`His vision,`
`his hearing,`
`and his sense of smell...`
`...All his senses were keener, including his sixth sense.`
`He could almost sense the presence of people in the distance`
` if only when crouching like an animal.`
`It felt strange...`
` As though he had stepped into another world...`
`He'd been feeling tense and anxious until today, battling with his own fear.`
`But now he felt as though he had metamorphosed into a different person...`
`June 20th, 1982 8:37 PM`
`"All right, everyone!`
` I'm going to explain how the raffle works!`
` Please gather around the altar!"`
`The festival had reached its climax. The raffle was going to start.`
`Both the women who were dancing and those who were waiting for the raffle gathered around the altar. `
`This was the first time they'd held a raffle.`
`The planning committee decided to hold one from this year onward, to attract more people to the festival.`
`At first, the prizes were things the committee members had donated. But Oryou, not appreciating how pathetic they looked, had them thrown away.`
`Oryou took the initiative and bought a brand-new TV, a washing machine, a cooling fan, and other such things for the raffle.`
`The committee wanted to keep it small initially,`
` but it turned out big, thanks to her.`
`Oryou was upset because the committee members weren't enthusiastic enough, in her opinion.`
`Some of the members thought it would be very difficult to prepare prizes of equal value the following year, so this might be the very first and last raffle.`
`"Thanks to you we have such wonderful prizes this year, Oryou-san.`
` They must have cost a lot, didn't they?`
` We can reimburse you from our budget."`
`"Buffoon! No point in reimbursing that.`
` It was never about the money.`
` ...Idiots."`
`"Now, now, don't say that...`
` This raffle's all thanks to you, Oryou-san."`
`"It's not like I'm doing this all by myself.`
` Don't be ridiculous."`
`The mayor, Kimiyoshi, was having a tough time pacifying Oryou.`
`All of a sudden, one of the committee members burst into the tent in a rush.`
`He looked upset, so Kimiyoshi assumed that somebody probably got hurt in an accident.`
`"What's going on, Makino-san?`
` I hope you're not having a heart attack."`
`Kimiyoshi made a joke to calm him down.`
`Makino, however, still looked tense. He whispered something to Kimiyoshi.`
`Even without hearing the exchange between Makino and Kimiyoshi, it was plain as day there was bad news.`
`"...Oryou-san.`
` I have unpleasant news, if you don't mind?"`
`Kimiyoshi, accompanied by Makino, moved to Oryou's side and spoke in a very serious tone.`
`Kimiyoshi whispered to her the exact same words Makino told him.`
`"......Oh, dear.`
` ...This is bad..."`
`"Ain't unexpected.`
` What happens thrice will happen a fourth time."`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` That's not funny, Oryou-san..."`
`"You're right, it isn't...`
` it's just another hassle..."`
`"The police are trying to identify the body.`
` I heard that the face was completely destroyed, so it'll be difficult..."`
`"...It's quite clear who it is, though..."`
`"Eh?`
` ...Do you know who it might be?"`
`Oryou glared at Kimiyoshi, then started chuckling.`
`"Hahahahaha, idiot!`
` It must be some impudent lad who didn't come to the Watanagashi festival!`
` People who respect Oyashiro-sama won't get involved in something like that."`
`Oryou kept laughing. Kimiyoshi and Makino didn't know how to react to that.`
` June 20th, 1982 9:04 PM`
`"...Hmm...`
` this is merciless."`
`"Kuma-chan,`
` every death is merciless, unless the dead wished for it.`
` They have my condolences...`
` How's it going over there?`
` Did you find something that could identify the body?"`
`The forensic investigators shook their heads.`
`"The victim's wearing sandals and casual clothes.`
` They must be from this neighborhood.`
` We should be able to identify the corpse by asking around."`
`"...That's the way we do it.`
` The section manager says this case might become classified.`
` So be careful with that."`
`"Gotcha."`
`Kumagai gathered some officers and gave them directions.`
`"Dr. Irie has arrived.`
` Doctor, it's over here."`
`A young doctor got out of his car and headed in the victim's direction.`
`"Hello...`
` I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.`
` I had to help with the raffle."`
`"You must have drunk a lot at the festival, doctor.`
` Are you sure you're sober?`
` Maybe I should run a breathalyzer test on you, just to be safe."`
`"I'm fine.`
` My assistant is driving."`
`"Clever of you...`
` Hey, let the doctor pass."`
`There was an area cordoned off with blue plastic sheets.`
`An officer rolled up the sheet and let Ooishi and Irie pass.`
`The forensic people were taking photos from many different angles.`
`The blood spatters and the bloody sandals were left untouched,`
` marked with chalk, and indicated with small alphabetized plates.`
`"...I'm not used to seeing things like this."`
`Irie took out a handkerchief and covered his nose.`
`"You should breathe through your mouth...`
` Well, you might sense the smell visually, though...`
` Na ha ha..."`
`The body appeared to be that of a middle-aged woman. It was soaked in blood.`
`It looked like a middle-aged woman because of the hair and what she was wearing.`
`The reason why no one could be certain it was a middle-aged woman was because...`
` its face was completely pulverized.`
`"...This is brutal."`
`"I'm sure it was done out of malice.`
` The victim must have been murdered right here, judging from the pattern of the blood spatters and the soles of the sandals. `
`And, even though not many people take this road, the body is right in the middle of it.`
` It's very unusual to see a culprit who would bludgeon their victim until their face was completely destroyed.`
`Also,`
` can you look at her arms?"`
`Ooishi put on latex gloves and lifted the corpse's arm.`
`"...See?`
` Spotless, aren't they?"`
`"Are you saying that the victim didn't try to protect her head? That there's no signs of struggle?"`
`"Right you are...`
` I think the victim lost consciousness with the first blow.`
`Then the culprit kept beating to complete the murder.`
` The victim was probably lying face-down at that time...`
` judging from the stains on her clothes."`
`"...The body is face-up now."`
`"The culprit seems to have flipped the victim over`
` in order to smash her face, even though by that point,`
` her death was certain."`
`"....................."`
`Irie looked like he was going to throw up, both because of the putrid smell and Ooishi's reasoning.`
`"Smashing the victim's face is clearly a sign of a grudge, in my experience.`
` It's a very profound grudge, too.`
` That means...`
` the culprit must be someone very close to the victim."`
`"...I understand you didn't call me to resuscitate her."`
`"Doctor.`
` Do you know who the victim is?`
` ...If you do, I don't have to waste time questioning the neighbors."`
`Irie looked at the body once again.`
`He looked away quickly and thought.`
`...Then, after a while.`
`Irie left the investigation area without saying anything.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I don't know."`
`"...Ehh......`
`Are you sure?"`
`Ooishi smirked and looked into Irie's eyes.`
`As though Irie was hiding something.`
`"...I'm not hiding anything."`
`"......Na ha ha ha.`
` I guess you're still under the influence, doctor.`
` Maybe you'll remember when you're sober.`
` Let me know if you do."`
`Ooishi tapped Irie on the back.`
`The doctor, saying he wanted some fresh air, left the scene.`
`Kumagai returned.`
`"Ooishi-san, the section manager is on the radio.`
` The one in the first car."`
`"...Irie lied."`
`"...Huh?"`
`"Nothing.`
` Hurry up and question the neighbors.`
` The victim must be from this area."`
` June 20th, 1982 9:39 PM`
`"Ooishi-san,`
` here he is!!"`
`"Thank you for coming here this late at night.`
` I know you have school tomorrow.`
` I'm really sorry to bother you."`
`"......No problem."`
`"Where's your father?"`
`"...My stepfather doesn't come home much..."`
`"Uh-huh?`
` Since when?`
` When did he come home last?"`
`"...I don't know...`
` I heard he's living with a woman who works at a club in Okinomiya or something.`
` I don't remember exactly when, but I guess I saw him a few weeks ago."`
`"......Uh-huh...`
` Do you have your father's address?"`
`"No."`
`"He's living with a woman who works at a club?`
`Do you know the name of the place?"`
`"...No.`
` I know it's in Okinomiya, and that's all."`
`"What's your father's name?"`
`"Teppei Houjou."`
`Ooishi signaled Kumagai with his chin, who nodded while taking notes.`
`"Were your mother and father getting along well?"`
`"...I don't know much about that, but...`
` I don't think so."`
`"I see...`
` I want you to tell me honestly. Do you know anyone who might have been holding a grudge against your stepmother?"`
`"...I don't."`
`"Na ha ha...`
` All right.`
` Please let me know if you remember something.`
` Here's my card.`
` My number is on it."`
`"...Okay."`
`"I might ask to see you again for further inquiries.`
` And if you see your stepfather, please let him know that we want to contact him...`
` Kuma-chan, drive him home, will you?"`
`"Oh, uh, no.`
` ...I can go home by myself."`
`"........................`
`Please, let us drive you home...`
` There's a possibility that the culprit who murdered your aunt is roaming around the neighborhood.`
` You might get hurt too."`
`".........Th-Thank you for your consideration,`
` but... really, I'm fine..."`
`Satoshi tried to reject the offer, but Ooishi and Kumagai insisted.`
`In the end, Satoshi was forced to accept.`
`He turned around to leave...`
`...When Ooishi spoke to him as if he remembered something he'd forgotten to say.`
`"Houjou-san...!"`
`"...Y-Yes...?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` It's no problem.`
` We'll catch the culprit soon."`
`"...Do you have any leads...?"`
`"Yes,`
` we do."`
`"...Like what?"`
`"...That's confidential.`
` Na ha ha ha ha...!"`
`Ordinary people might think that Ooishi was trying to cheer the poor kid up with a joke...`
`"...Well,`
` usually people get pretty worked up when they commit murder...`
` Though of course, there are some exceptions..."`
`"What kind of evidence do you find when the culprit's worked up...?"`
`"........."`
`"............"`
`"When somebody is in a very excited condition, their body shows many symptoms,`
` like sweat, loss of hair..."`
`"........."`
`"We often find the culprit's hair at crime scenes.`
` Well, this is outside,`
` so it's a bit different, but still."`
`"Did you find their hair...?"`
`"I don't know yet.`
` The forensic guys are searching the scene right now.`
` I'm anxious to see`
` what they'll bring me.`
` Nfu fu fu fu!"`
`".........Excuse me. I have to go now."`
`"Please.`
` Kuma-chan, would you?"`
`"Sure."`
`"Houjou-san,`
` see you again soon.`
` I'll let you know if there's any progress in the investigation...`
` Let me know when you remember something.`
` Let's cooperate to catch the murderer of your stepmother. `
`Nfu fu fu fu fu..."`
