`Either Satoshi-kun was smart, or very lucky.`
` Or maybe it wasn't him... The police found nothing at the crime scene to indicate his involvement in the murder.`
`Yet Satoshi-kun was still the prime suspect.`
`Considering his home environment, he had a strong enough motive.`
`He had no alibi.`
`The police had everything other than physical evidence.`
`It wasn't surprising that Ooishi took a chance.`
`He probably didn't expect me to step in. But what I did was too little to avert his suspicion of Satoshi-kun.`
`Ooishi believed that Satoshi-kun did it.`
`He was waiting for Satoshi-kun to fall apart and confess...`
`That's what`
` both Ooishi`
` and I were thinking.`
`But that hypothesis was destroyed later on.`
`I'll not talk about it now,`
` but Ooishi's theory will be disproven, and the police will be thrown into shock.`
`A question comes to mind.`
`That is....`
` who saved Satoshi-kun?`
`I can only think of the possibility that the Sonozaki family invented the culprit.`
