`The cops were smart enough to separate us during questioning.`
`Ooishi didn't come to talk to me.`
`His aim was Satoshi-kun and nobody else.`
`I got a young cop who just talked about ordinary things.`
`He must have been trying to ease me into the interrogation.`
`...When I realized that, the clumsy way he spoke began to frustrate me.`
`Is Satoshi-kun all right?`
`I didn't think Ooishi really bought my testimony.`
`He must have been trying to get Satoshi-kun to confess in spite of that.`
`......All I could do was pray that he'd keep quiet.`
`The phone on the desk rang,`
` and the cop picked it up.`
`"...This is Kumagai...`
` ...What?`
` All right...`
` I understand.`
` Right away."`
`He hung up and told me somebody had come to retrieve me.`
`Looked like Satoshi-kun had to stay.`
`...Were they going to continue the interrogation just because he had nobody to pick him up?`
`...Although, maybe I should have been worrying more about myself.`
`The hag had probably heard about me by now, since I revealed my real identity to the police.`
`I couldn't hide any longer.`
`I was going to receive some sort of punishment.`
`I had no idea what she'd end up doing to me.`
`The degree of punishment for a traitor is always severe in the world of the Sonozakis.`
`The punishment must be carried out.`
`...If it's to protect the family's reputation, it's carried out no matter what.`
`...Maybe I should kiss my pinky finger while I still can.`
`I asked the young cop just in case.`
`"Hey, `
`did you know that, in America, if a condemned criminal gets arrested in a state which has banned capital punishment, they'll refuse to surrender him to the state prosecuting him if that state hasn't banned it?"`
`"Huh...??"`
`...Maybe it was too difficult for him.`
` He just looked puzzled.`
`A glossy black car was waiting for me in front of the police station.`
`A few men from my dad's office bowed to me.`
`"It's been a long time, Shion-san."`
`"...Where's Kasai?"`
`"........."`
`Kasai had been helping me ever since my escape from the school......`
` They wouldn't allow him to walk free.`
`"...How's Sis doing?`
` Does she have something to say about this?"`
`"...We were only told to bring you to the main house.`
` Please ask her when you get there."`
`After saying that, he escorted me into the car.`
`A man sat on either side of me......`
` Obviously they didn't want me to escape.`
`...Thinking of Satoshi-kun, I looked back at the police station.`
`Hold on tight, Satoshi-kun...`
` I'll grin and bear it, too.`
`The car started off roughly.`
`It was never a good occasion when I went to this house.`
`Except when Mion and I were really small, oblivious of what the Sonozaki name meant for us...`
`...I'd been here only when I had to attend boring family councils.`
`The car parked behind the house.`
`Traitors aren't allowed in through the main gate.`
`I got out of the car. It looked like Sis would be the only person to receive me.`
`I almost spoke to her casually, but her cold gaze froze me before I could.`
`"...It's been a while, Shion.`
` I never expected to see you other than on New Year's."`
`It gave me the chills to hear her greet me in that cold manner.`
`"It's a pleasure to see you again, Mion-sama.`
` I feel overjoyed to have the chance to see you, other than on New Year's."`
`I responded, trying to sound likewise.`
`"Our leader is deeply upset.`
` I wonder how you'll explain yourself."`
`"......I have nothing to explain."`
`I had no excuse.`
`I'd escaped from the school solely because I couldn't stand it there.`
`That was all.`
`"Shion, come this way.`
` Everyone is waiting for you."`
`Mion escorted me, and the others followed...`
`We went to the garden, not into the house.`
`...As we passed through the huge yard into the woods, I realized where she was taking me.`
`When we were little, we were told never to go near these woods.`
`...I had a vague idea of what was in the back of them.`
`The more hideous rumors I heard about the family, the more credible those rumors seemed.`
`...Well, I wasn't completely certain about any of that.`
`I'd never expected to see the torture room for myself...`
`We came to a concave clearing in the middle of the woods.`
`I saw a metal door at the bottom of it. The door reminded me of a bomb shelter.`
`I was surprised to hear my own voice.`
`...My voice was trembling.`
` ...It made me realize that I was more scared than I thought.`
`Nobody answered my question...`
` The very air felt tense.`
`...According to the family rules,`
` one of the twins must be eliminated.`
`Was I... finally going to be eliminated?`
`I realized I had been underestimating my punishment.`
`I hadn't been aware of the real terror until now. I just thought I was.`
`Beyond the steel door, the air had an intimidating smell... this really was happening to me.`
`...I shouldn't allow myself to give in to fear.`
`I felt like saying something rude, but my lips were dry,`
` and my fingers were fidgeting.`
`I was escorted through the narrow hallway and down a few sets of stairs.`
`There, I saw another huge steel door.`
`...So, this was the place.`
`It was a spacious and...`
` utterly odd-looking room.`
`The room had two sections that looked completely different.`
`One side looked like a lounge.`
` I saw several high-ranking members of the family council sitting on cushions there, looking expressionless.`
`The other half was tiled, as if in a large public bath.`
`That was already puzzling enough.`
`...And... there were those things...`
`To be honest, they had captured my attention from the moment I arrived.`
`I noticed them even before I saw the lounge and tiled space...`
` I just didn't want to accept that they existed.`
`...I couldn't stand straight.`
` I almost dropped to my knees.`
`But I couldn't.`
`Two young men had been holding me by the arms since I got here.`
`There were oddly-shaped things hanging from the wall...`
`...Ah... I was just refusing to recognize what they were.`
`I knew exactly what they were called.`
`......Ahhh...`
` I see, I see.`
`I understood that`
` those eerily shaped objects were`
` torture devices from Hell...`
`"Damned fool!`
` How dare you return..."`
`The hag, sitting at the front of the lounge, intimidated me in a horrid voice.`
`She kept cursing me for a little while, but she was so incensed that I could barely tell what she was saying.`
`...I knew what she was trying to say, though.`
`...The hag was willing to forgive my escape from the school.`
`But once I revealed my identity to the police, she had to step in.`
`Since I had disobeyed the family rule, she, as the leader, was forced to punish me.`
`...Moreover.`
`There was one thing that bothered her more than anything else.`
`...The fact that I covered for Satoshi-kun.`
`...The Houjou family had been seen as traitors to the village ever since the dam conflict.`
`Satoshi-kun is still considered one of them.`
`She couldn't accept that I was connected to him.`
`To me, this was a bit unexpected.`
`I'd escaped from the school the hag had put me in.`
`All the while, I'd believed that was what she was upset about.`
`...But in fact, she said that she was the most uncomfortable with my connection with Satoshi-kun.`
`I couldn't believe this.`
`...Of course I knew that Satoshi-kun's family was persecuted for their betrayal.`
`But I didn't think that Satoshi-kun was also burdened with that responsibility.`
`"......He has nothing to do with that...`
` I understand that his parents were ostracized, but he shouldn't be..." `
`"Shut the hell up!!!!"`
`The hag interrupted me with a shout, which made me cower in fear.`
`She continued slandering the Houjous, and said that Satoshi-kun was a cursed child.`
`...I started feeling pissed off.`
`What did he do to deserve this?`
` What was he being blamed for?`
`It was too late when I realized I'd said that out loud.`
`The hag looked furious. I'd obviously upset her.`
`I decided to repeat myself, to make it very clear how I felt.`
`"...What are you saying, you old hag?`
` Everything you've spouted is nonsense!"`
`"Huhh?!`
` Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!!"`
`I shouted loudly to silence the hag.`
`"What the fuck do you know about Satoshi-kun?!`
` How could you talk about him like he's some pest when you don't know anything about him?!!`
` I know how sweet he is!`
` You don't like him because he's a Houjou?! `
`How fucking stupid is that?!!`
` Is even your brain archaic, or what?!`
` You hate the fact that a Sonozaki is with a Houjou that much?!`
` That's not just stupid--that's beyond stupid!!! `
`Boy, I never expected to feel like Juliet!`
` Aha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`My voice became hoarse from shouting.`
`My face was messy with tears.`
` Even so, I didn't feel like putting a stop to my emotional explosion.`
`...I was all too aware that I was doing this just to overwhelm my fear.`
`The hag was glaring at me while breathing heavily.`
`I glared back at her as fiercely as I could.`
`......Eventually,`
` I realized that her sticking point was my relationship with Satoshi-kun.`
`...She wasn't only upset that I had a mere connection with him.`
`"...I see... Looks like Mion mentioned that, too..."`
`It was as though Mion was wearing a mask.`
` She didn't budge under my penetrating glare.`
`...That was what the hag was really unhappy about.`
`...The fact that I was in love with Satoshi-kun...`
`"Ahahahahaha!`
` Aha hahahahahaha!!`
` I don't give a shit about his family background or my own!`
` Yeah, I'll admit that I'm in love with him!!`
` I love Satoshi Houjou-kun.`
` I love him so much!`
` Is that so wrong?! `
`Do you need a reason to love somebody?!"`
`I could see the relatives shaking their heads in turmoil.`
`Among them... I saw my mom. She must've been trying to protect me.`
`But even she wouldn't look at me.`
`Instead, she looked silently at the floor.`
`"Did you guys in the back hear me?!`
` Am I wrong?!`
` You'd know how sweet Satoshi-kun is in an instant if you bothered to get to know him!!`
` How can you put him down without......?"`
`Mion held out a hand to silence me.`
`Then, she slowly walked in my direction.`
`"......That is enough, Shion.`
` I understand what you wanted to say."`
`"....................."`
`Mion put her head close to mine and whispered.`
`"......Shion, I know how you feel...`
` but you can't go back after coming this far...`
` You have to pay for what you did."`
`"......What did I do?!`
` Why me?!`
` That's ridiculous..."`
`"Shion."`
`Mion's face turned cold again... and she calmly told me.`
`"...You're probably right,`
` but...`
` this is Hinamizawa, and we are Sonozakis, as I'm sure you understand.`
` We are the leaders of the Three Families,`
` and you are the twin sister of the successor, Mion Sonozaki. `
`Yet..."`
`I interrupted her.`
`"We haven't agreed on that matter ever since I came back.`
` You're full of this reputation shit!`
` Hinamizawa?`
` The Sonozakis?`
` So what?!`
` I don't give a fuck about..."`
`"Listen!"`
`Mion interrupted me, just like I did her.`
`"......How many people did you depend on`
` to start your new life in Okinomiya?"`
`...Chills shot through my spine.`
`"......Kasai-san is in the cell at the back."`
`"Wh-Why... Why Kasai?!"`
`I knew why, of course.`
`......The moment I got caught, those who helped me were destined to meet the same fate...`
` We were all subject to the punishment of betrayal.`
`Maybe my punishment would be lighter than what they'd be going through.`
`...Kasai and Uncle Yoshiroh must have been treated...`
` much worse than this.`
`Everybody who helped me was falling victim.`
`"...I know that you are prepared for your punishment,`
` but have you ever thought of the consequences that Kasai-san and Uncle Yoshiroh will have to face...?"`
`My head rapidly cooled down...`
` My aggression was all used up.`
`I should be able to bear whatever punishment they'd bring on me.`
`But I resented the fact that I'd be putting the people who supported me at risk.`
`"...Shion,`
` apologize to Granny.`
` If you do, the others won't have to suffer...`
` All right?"`
`"But... but, Mion,`
` did I really do something wrong...?`
` Was any of what I did that bad...?"`
`...The moment Mion learned that I wasn't willing to apologize, her expression turned cold again.`
`She turned her back to me, and returned to the lounge.`
`...I'd talked back to the hag in a really harsh manner.`
`...I'd told her that I didn't do anything wrong.`
`...Yet I had involved many people to who I owed so much.`
`...It went without saying, this was my responsibility.`
`...I was the sole person to blame... and no fault lay with them.`
`...Yes, Kasai and Yoshiroh-san were blameless, just as Satoshi-kun was.`
`But then... as if she read my mind,`
` Mion turned around...`
` and gave a slight nod.`
`It was possible that something was going to happen`
` to Satoshi-kun...`
`......On top of Kasai and Uncle Yoshiroh.`
`"Wa-Wait... Sis...!!"`
`That can't happen...`
` Satoshi-kun... I mean, nobody else should be punished.`
` Please forgive them!`
`"...What is it, Shion...?"`
`"......I'm`
`........."`
`Tears rolled down my cheeks.`
`...I no longer cared about my pride.`
`"...I'm sorry...`
` I was wrong...`
` Please forgive me."`
`I should've said what the hag wanted to hear.`
` Yet, she still looked unsatisfied.`
`...Maybe that wasn't too surprising.`
`...I had just denounced her so badly in front of the relatives...`
` She wouldn't forgive me so easily.`
`Just then, Mion spoke as the successor.`
`"So, Shion...`
` How do you propose to pay for this?"`
`"P-Pay...? What do you want me to do...?"`
`Nothing could be scarier than being told to pay up while standing next to horrid-looking torture devices.`
`...I was completely terrified.`
`I couldn't move from trembling. Mion saw that and whispered to our grandmother.`
`...The hag nodded.`
`Mion summoned some young minions and gave them an order.`
`They removed one of the torture devices hanging on the wall...`
`...then set a table in front of me and put the device on top of it.`
`"...What is... this...?"`
`"...It's a tool for removing fingernails.`
` Do you know how to use it...?"`
`"N-No way..."`
`I shook as I stared at the tool.`
`It looked like a giant nail clipper.`
`...You probably... put the part that looks like a beak between your finger and fingernail,`
` pulling them apart if you squeezed the handle.`
`The chills ran up and down my spine when I imagined that...`
`"Each fingernail represents one of your responsibilities...`
` Shion Sonozaki,`
` no matter which ones you choose,`
` you must remove three nails yourself."`
`Three...`
` One for Kasai,`
` one for Uncle Yoshiroh,`
` and... the last for Satoshi-kun.`
`...It was a fairly reasonable number.`
`"Will you... really not punish the others...?"`
`"....................."`
`"Promise me...`
` Please let them go if I do this..."`
`"This is a punishment, not a negotiation.`
` If you don't like the procedure..."`
`"I'll do it!!`
` Just give me a second... I'm doing it..."`
`I put the device to my little finger while shaking badly...`
`If my fingernail were shorter, it would have been harder.`
`...The metal beak captured my little finger beautifully.`
`The subordinates then stabilized my left hand with a different restraining tool.`
`...That seemed reasonable, because my finger would slip out if it weren't restrained like that.`
`As the subordinates buckled up the leather straps,`
` I realized that this was really happening,`
` and there was no escape.`
`Somewhere in my mind, I'd been thinking that they might forgive me after just the gesture alone.`
`I shouldn't have been so naive.`
`The emotions I'd been holding back appeared in the form of tears and kept rolling down my cheeks.`
`It was like my feelings were being squeezed out until the very last drip.`
`...Something even more horrifying followed this.`
`It was the silence that awaited my next action.`
`"...So...`
` what`
` should I do now.........?"`
`One of the subordinates pointed to the handle, and told me to either squeeze it or hit it.`
`...He recommended that the latter would be easier, to make it quick.`
`Nobody said anything after that.`
`There was nothing to hear but the sound of my sweat dripping onto the floor.`
`The onlookers were staring at me silently, waiting for me to execute my punishment.`
`...Both the hag and Mion...`
` they were also anticipating it.`
`......I could refuse.`
`...But that meant I wouldn't be paying up.`
`This punishment exists to offer payment in exchange for the safety of those who helped me.`
` ...If I refused, they would suffer.`
`"Huff`
`... huff`
`... hah... hah..."`
`I started breathing heavily...`
`I knew.`
` I knew that if I did this, the others would go free.`
`This was, if you thought about it, quite a good deal.`
`...If it weren't me, it wouldn't be just three fingernails.`
`...If it were Kasai, he'd have to sacrifice his little finger, or something even worse.`
`I knew. I knew that.`
`It was my selfish desire to get away from that school.`
`Why did Kasai have to suffer because of that?`
`I knew. I knew that.`
`Why did Uncle Yoshiroh have to suffer just because he provided me with a job?`
`"Huff... huff... huff... huff!"`
`I knew that the hag and the other relatives still hated the Houjous...`
`So I didn't know what they'd do to Satoshi-kun if I didn't do this...`
`...Would they bring Satoshi-kun here and tell him to do the same?`
`...Would they tell him to remove his fingernails in exchange for forgiving me?`
`"...Huff... huff... huff... huff... huff!"`
`...He'd do it.`
`...He'd sacrifice himself with no hesitation in order to save others.`
`My sweat dripped onto the table through my nose.`
`...I'd do it... yes...`
`...It was only three fingernails.`
`...It might hurt a lot, but I wouldn't die. The fingernails would grow back.`
` It wouldn't even leave a huge scar...`
`I shouldn't be afraid.`
`...The punishment was minimal because it was me.`
`If I refused to do this, the others would be punished much more severely...`
`I couldn't let that happen to Kasai, Uncle Yoshiroh... or Satoshi-kun...`
`I was the only one who should be punished...`
`So... So I just needed to bear the pain...`
`"Hah... ahh... oww... ahh...!"`
`I wasn't just breathing heavily anymore.`
`I was also moaning faintly,`
` ready to scream at any moment.`
`That's right... make it quick.`
`This wasn't torture, so I didn't have to prolong the moment of pain.`
`...I should do it in one swift blow.`
` That way, my pain and fear would be minimized......!`
`...I raised my right arm.`
`Quickly, quickly.`
`The pain would be lessened if I did it in one stroke.`
`...It'd be much more painful if I messed it up.`
`"Hah... hah!`
` Hahh`
`.....................!!"`
`I held my breath.`
`I felt as if my body was frozen. I was choking. The chills crept up my spine.`
`Don't be afraid, Shion.`
`...Fingernails are just a tiny fraction of the whole body. Just one square centimeter......`
` I could do this. I could bear it.`
`"Whooooooaaaaahhh!!"`
`I smacked my right hand onto the handle of the device.`
`".........Augh!!!!"`
`I sensed the noise through my body instead of through my ears. At the same time, I felt a pain I'd never experienced before.`
`A moment later, the pain pulsated with my heartbeat.`
`"......Ooooohhhh...... oooohhhhh!!!"`
`I clenched my teeth.`
`I felt like my teeth were cracking!`
` I tightly shut my eyes`
` until my eyeballs got squeezed up!!`
`The pain wouldn't fade.`
`Rather, it swelled with my blood pressure. I felt as though it was bloating like a balloon.`
`Timidly... I opened my eyes.`
`...I found that my little finger wasn't really drenched in blood.`
` It was bleeding, but not much. Certainly not enough to explain how much it hurt.`
`My fingernail was...`
` open just like the hood of a car...`
` I couldn't believe what I was seeing.`
` It was overwhelming.`
`It occurred to me that I'd only done one out of three.`
`...Did I have to repeat this two more times?`
`Did I have to remove the nails from my ring and middle fingers as well...?`
`I looked at the hag and at Mion, begging for mercy.`
`...But they were just silently staring at me,`
` as if the show had only just begun.`
`I saw no hint of mercy in their eyes.`
`...They wouldn't be changing their minds.`
`Since they said three, it had to be three!`
`They wouldn't forgive me until I removed two more fingernails...!`
`"...Mion... look, isn't this enough...?`
` It really hurts, you know that?`
` You see that in my eyes, don't you?`
` It really... hurts... Heh heh... heh heh heh heh..."`
`Mion answered, still wearing a cold look.`
`"...Shion.`
` You can't keep going...?"`
`She didn't mean that it was sufficient.`
`...What she meant is that the others would have to take the remaining punishment if I didn't.`
`I knew that... I really did know!`
`"I... I'll do it!!!`
` This is easy...!!`
` You sadists!!`
` Hah... hah!!`
` This doesn't scare me, this doesn't hurt...`
` Ahhhhhhhh...!!!"`
`I quickly moved the metal beak and set it on my ring finger.`
`...And smacked it with no hesitation.`
`...Instead of making it quick, maybe I was just rushing out of fear.`
`I'd messed up.`
`The torture tool had clipped just the tip of my fingernail.`
`The pain, however, was equal.`
` I couldn't believe I'd only chipped it.`
`...Did I have to do it again?`
`Did I have to continue removing the nail from my ring finger...?`
` That much pain, again...?`
` Again......?!`
`".........Shion?"`
`"No... ugh... I don't want to do it!!!"`
`I couldn't bear it anymore...`
` I started crying shamelessly.`
`"I can't take it anymore!!`
` It's too painful...!!`
` Forgive me, please!!`
` I'm sorry. I apologize!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!"`
`They didn't seem to hear my voice.`
`...It felt as though there was an invisible barrier between us.`
`They showed no mercy. They were just here to witness this ritual.`
`So, rather than sympathetic, they looked amazed by my screw-up.`
`Mion walked up to me...`
` and whispered to my crying face.`
`"...Shion...`
` there's just a bit more to go. Hang in there."`
`"No, no, no, no!!`
` I can't do this!! It really hurts! It really does!!`
` Ooh... ooh... waaaahhhh!!`
` Ahhhhhh!!"`
`Mion shook her head, then signaled the subordinates.`
`...They came from behind me.`
`They covered my head with something like a knit cap.`
` It was a blindfold.`
`One of them pinned me in a nelson hold, restricting my movement.`
`"No, stop it!`
` Noooooo!!!"`
`I couldn't overpower the guy behind me.`
`Then, I felt something strange on my left hand.`
`...The other guy was doing something with the torture tool.`
`...He... put the metal beak between my ring finger and its fingernail......`
`"Noooooo!!!`
` Mom, help me... Mooooomm!!`
` Ahhhhhhhhh!!!"`
`My left hand was fixed in the restraints, so I couldn't put up much protest anyway.`
`...But even that left hand was pressed down by his rough palms until it hurt, robbing it of the freedom even to tremble.`
`...They had no hesitation.`
`It was made very clear to me how merciless people could be.`
`Robbed of my vision, all I could do was clench my teeth against the pain assailing me.`
`If... there was anything I was thankful for...`
`...It was that he was well practiced, and had ripped off both of my fingernails cleanly.`
`Pain and screaming might induce narcotic chemicals in the brain......`
` While screaming, I started losing consciousness...`
