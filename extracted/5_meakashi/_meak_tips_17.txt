`The head of the Kimiyoshi family was the one who called the main house most often after the fifth year's curse.`
`My father called the second most.`
`My parents were still high in the hierarchy, but the stir caused by my mother's disownment still hung over us, so we got treated as outcasts.`
`So the fact that my father received so many calls proved how much the hag valued us despite the distance at which we were kept, demonstrating her own two-faced respect for both sides of the coin.`
`My father seems to be in charge of the intelligence bureau.`
`He reported police information, gossip, and rumors going around in the yakuza business to the hag.`
`He silences, stirs, and distorts that information at her request.`
`By the way, my servant Kasai is an old friend of my father's.`
`...That must be why Kasai knows many things.`
`But I don't know`
` if my father is involved in the curse's execution.`
`My assumption is that although he gathered information on the police investigation about the case,`
` he wasn't involved in the execution itself.`
`...The fact that my father and the hag have this close connection isn't widely known.`
`People know that she uses his information network, but they don't look very far beyond that.`
`In the same way...`
`It's possible that a 'curse execution team' exists under the hag's direct control. People just aren't aware of it...`
