`"Yes. When Mr. Kasai broke in, the room was empty, and the window leading to the balcony was open.`
` That was when she fell. `
`She hit the elevator housing right beneath, which gave her a concussion. `
`Then she rolled off the roof and hit the ground, killing her.`
`The reason Mr. Kasai didn't find her even though he suspected her suicide is that she was on the elevator housing at that time, unconscious.`
`Keiichi Maebara was stabbed at about the same time.`
` Was Shion Sonozaki unconscious on the roof then...?"`
`"I doubt it.`
` She must've snuck out of the building, stabbed Keiichi, `
`then accidentally fell when she came back...... Doesn't that sound right?`
` Ah, would you look at the neighboring balcony again?"`
`"Ooishi-san, you've got a call on line three."`
`"Oh, who is it from?"`
`"Sato, apparently.`
` He says the password is 'ron.'"`
`"Na ha ha!`
` Hello!`
` Ah, Sato-san.`
` You must have some good news."`
`"...An informant got in contact with me and you were right after all."`
`"Thank you!`
` I'll buy you a drink on Flower Road!"`
`"What was that call about?`
` A mahjong invitation?"`
`"Bingo.`
` The Sonozaki sisters switched places.`
` Mion is Shion, and Shion is Mion.`
` They made a mistake when they were supposed to tattoo the successor. `
`So, Mion and Shion are swapped around in this notebook. `
`So then Satoshi-kun and Shion-san... No, Mion-san?`
` This is confusing!`
` Anyway, with that, you gain a clearer understanding of their relationship."`
`"Are you talking about the mysterious notebook you received the other day?`
` Didn't you say it was all mumbo jumbo that could possibly confuse the case?"`
`"Even after switching the names, it's still confusing......`
` I don't know how much of the content I can trust...`
` Even if this is true, Rika Furude's death seems very suspicious..."`
`"...It's the diary of a lunatic.`
` It drove me nuts when I read it.`
` You know this line on the last page, about how she's sorry for being born...? That makes me want to jump out the window!"`
`"...Even so...`
` this is a happy diary."`
`"A happy diary`
`......?"`
`"Do you know how many times Satoshi-kun's name appears in this notebook......?`
` Shion-san really loved him.`
` But because she was so young, a few mistakes caused that love to be misdirected."`
