`<Implements Used For the Ritual>`
`Ritual tools utilized for ancient religious ceremonies are commonly referred to as 'implements' or 'ritual implements,' and even now, some of them are enshrined on the property of Furude Shrine and the Three Families.`
`However, the identifiable tools are all decorative, and none appear to have been used in rituals governing the dark side of Onigafuchi Village.`
`As the Edo era came to a close and many traditional rituals were lost, were they lost as well,`
` or perhaps buried in the darkness?`
`I don't believe so.`
`Both the implements used on the night of the feast of Onikakushi and those used during the sacrificial ceremony must still exist, enshrined away from the eyes of the masses.`
`Without a doubt, they exist here, today, at this very moment, in Hinamizawa.`
`Also, I'm nearly certain where they've been enshrined.`
`What was once locked steadfastly has, for some reason, changed this year to a cheap-looking padlock.`
` He may be able to do something about such a lock.`
`However, it is not far from the assembly hall, nor is it ever far from the presence of people.`
`However, I will not give up.`
`...The night when it becomes a blind spot to every villager in Hinamizawa is coming soon.`
`Soon, it will be`
` Watanagashi.`
