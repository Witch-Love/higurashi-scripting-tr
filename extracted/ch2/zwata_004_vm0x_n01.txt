`"You guys did tell me about the festival before. That's right, Rika-chan is on the festival committee, isn't she? Does it have something to do with that?"`
`"Rika-chan is a shrine maiden for the Watanagashi, so she has to perform a ritual dance. `
`It's practice for that."`
`Come to think of it, I have a feeling Mom did say something about it during dinner the other day.`
` So, Rika-chan plays the part of a shrine maiden?`
`"I see, Mom did say that futons, padded cloaks and stuff are made as offerings. ...So, does that mean the cotton stuffing gets pulled out during a dance or something?"`
`"They also pile futons up on the altar.`
` The Watanagashi is a festival that happens at the shrine on a Sunday every June.`
` It's very lively!"`
`Mion and Rena nodded back at me, looking a bit impressed.`
` It seemed that my observations were on mark.`
` Although, when I first heard about it, I imagined piling futons up in the swamp.`
` ...but that'd block the river, and be a real pain to clear up after.`
`"I've heard of people leaving offerings of things like needles or kitchen knives to their ancestors or to casualties of war...`
` But an offering of futons is a first for me.`
` What's the history behind that?"`
`"Ye fookin biiiiitch!!`
` I'll fookin bash yer ead in!!"`
`*sigh*... honestly!"`
`"More importantly, just now...`
` Were you surprised?"`
