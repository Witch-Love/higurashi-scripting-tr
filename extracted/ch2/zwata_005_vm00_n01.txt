`"I heard they're planning on selling Angel Mort figures.`
` We'll have to pay heed at the next Wonder Festival...!!"`
`"They sell used Angel Mort uniforms on the 4th floor of [redacted] in Akiba!!`
` But they cost 280,000..."`
`"'Tis an absurd price!`
` AnnMull cost 80,000; when BroBa closed down the going rate for theirs was 12,000. (That's the price for used ones. Knock-offs are less than half of that!)"`
`"A knock-off from [redacted] is fine with me, I wonder if they'll start selling them~☆`
` Then I'll put it on mine life-size figure I did buy off of [redacted] for several hundred thousand~☆ `
`If I can wake up every day to an angel from Angel, that'll really get my gears going~!!!"`
`"Shut up, you greasy fatass!`
` Get out of here before I get angry."`
`"It seems you don't understand.`
` Yonder waitress was the one who wet mine pants!`
` This is her punishment!!"`
`"...There's nothing I can say to that."`
`"Mew too.`
` Not a nyamber one, but a nyamber two!`
` I need to cash out meow!"`
`"Where's da toilet!?`
` I found eeeet!`
` Urine for it now!!!"`
`"*pant pant*... Women's toilets are the best~~!!!!!"`
`"That would be purrfect!!`
` Purrease, purrease!!`
` At this rate it'll end up becoming group enema purray~~!!"`
`"Listen up, you tubs of lard!!`
` You know what happens if you even set one foot outside this door, right!?"`
`"Ke-Keiichi-kun... was a pervert..."`
`"If you walked around with it, then you'd be treated like a weirdo starting tomorrow. Definitely!"`
`"Gya!?"`
` "Unf!!"`
` "Hwaaa!?!?"`
`"Hrngh..."`
` "...This is..."`
` "...Urk..."`
`"This time we'll have her spill everything on my pants, and have her wipey-wipey right down to my underwear!!"`
