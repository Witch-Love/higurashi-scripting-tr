`"Yep.`
` Sorry.`
` I suddenly got called in to my part-time job at my uncle's shop today."`
`"What's that?`
` No club today then?"`
`"Well, ah-ha-ha, I'm sorry...!"`
`Mion put her hands together in apology and grinned.`
`"If you really want to do club today, then you can always do it without this old man.`
` The club locker is stuffed full with games.`
` You can pick whatever."`
`The club locker was the transdimensional space from which Mion pulled games whenever we met for club activities.`
`I wondered how so many freaking games could be stored in the lockerâ€”it was even smaller than the one with the cleaning supplies in it...`
`Besides those games, it was also a cornucopia of suspicious objects (costumes?) for punishment games...!`
`If we lined them all up on the floor in order to sort them, they would definitely fill the entire classroom.`
`"...Nah, we shouldn't.`
` I get the feeling that if I mess around in that locker, everything inside will come tumbling down on me."`
`"Ah-ha-ha-ha!`
` Yeah, I guess you're right.`
` Maybe amateurs shouldn't meddle with this. He-he-he!"`
`Mion gave a hearty laugh, implying that the only one who could do so was the club president.`
`"......Mii.`
` The teacher is looking for the key to the gym storehouse.`
` Do you have any idea where it could be?"`
`"Eh?`
` ...Did I not return it to the teachers' lounge?"`
`Mion said, feeling about in her pocket.`
`...Judging by her expression, she must have planned on returning it, but it was still in her pocket.`
`"I knew you had it, Mion-san~!`
` I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you simply must have been the one who had it!"`
`"......I was right, too.`
` Satoko and I were both right."`
`Giggling, Satoko and Rika-chan clapped their hands together in celebration.`
`"You're annoying!"`
`Slap! Clap!`
`Mion elbowed Satoko and Rika-chan in their heads, then headed for the teachers' lounge.`
`"Oh, right.`
` Have you two heard?`
` Mion has a part-time job, and that's why she's not coming to the club."`
`"Oh, is that so?!`
` That's so very droll of her."`
`"......Meep."`
`The two of them made disappointed faces.`
`...Whatever anyone said, Mion's club was always the number one thing I looked forward to when going to school.`
`It wasn't hard to agree with their melancholic expressions after hearing it wouldn't be happening today.`
`"So Mion's got a part-time job.`
` ...I wonder what she's doing, anyway?"`
`Whenever Mion cancelled club, it was usually because of her job.`
`However, it also didn't seem like she went there every day.`
`She would go two or three days in a row, then not go at all for a while.`
`...It sounded like a pretty damn random part-time job.`
`"......She isn't working at any one shop or anything."`
`"She isn't? ...Then does that mean she's a day laborer?"`
`Mion, wearing socks and a helmet, sweating to death in a factory...`
` ...I couldn't imagine such a thing.`
`"Mion-san helps her uncles out whenever their employees go on vacations. She's like a handyman."`
`"Ah... I get it.`
` Now that you mention it, her having a job at her uncle's place...`
` I think I've heard about that before."`
`"......She has a lot of uncles who run their own shops, so Mii is in very high demand."`
`She has a lot of uncles who own shops?`
` A lot of them?`
`"Oh, you were unaware, Keiichi-san?`
` There are many relatives of Mion-san's in Okinomiya who run their own stores."`
`"Huh...`
` I didn't know that.`
` ...So, they're all different kinds?"`
`"Yes.`
` There's a bakery, a produce market, a ramen shop,`
` and many others besides.`
` That toy store we went to for the club the other day is one of them."`
`I was dumbfounded.`
` ...That's... amazing!`
`"...Is Mion's family blessed with some kind of crazy business sense?`
` They run so many different things, it's kind of amazing!"`
`Okay, a couple of weird things came up that time, but still!`
` I could tell it was pretty extensive.`
`Rika-chan and I gave her a pat on the head.`
`"...!?`
` ...W-Why are you petting me!? ...!?"`
`"......We're petting you because you're a good girl, Satoko."`
`Satoko was lost in confusion, but she seemed to understand she was being made fun of.`
