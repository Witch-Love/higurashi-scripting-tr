`"No, no, don't worry about it.`
` You see, when you order the oden here...`
` for some reason, it ends up on the annual invoice for our gas contracts.`
` So don't be shy and have another drink."`
`The man, red-faced, waved his hand to say that he'd had enough, and disappeared into the brilliant neon lights in front of the station.`
`"...Kuma-chan, you should be taking notes.`
` The most modest people are the ones who live the longest. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
`"Was all that... true?"`
`"Well, I don't know about that.`
` Whether or not it's true, I think there's meaning in hearing something that sounds so plausible."`
`"...Would something like that be a motive to go for the mayor...?"`
`"Kuma-chan, here's what I always say.`
` The motive only has to be enough for the person in question.`
` You need to think about how different people value different things.`
` ...Hey, bartender,`
` give me another mug."`
`Though we have been suppressing the information, Tomitake and Takano's deaths were already known throughout Hinamizawa.`
`All of the rumors pointed to them having incurred the wrath of Oyashiro-sama for setting foot in the forbidden temple—the storehouse for ritual implements.`
`According to the rumors, there were two other people who went in there with them.`
` ...Shion Sonozaki...`
` and Keiichi Maebara.`
`People were whispering in the shadows that those two would be cursed by Oyashiro-sama as well.`
`Apparently, however, the responsibility didn't fall solely on the four trespassers' shoulders.`
`Until last year, it was locked up tight, but this year it had been changed to a simpler lock—hadn't that been what allowed thieves to enter so easily?`
`...Those were the rumors going around.`
`"Have you ever seen it, Kuma-chan?`
` I remember it well—I had to go there for something quite a while back."`
`"Sorry, I don't really remember."`
`"It was locked up so tight it was scary.`
` There were these real heavy bars holding it shut.`
` It was sealed up as good as a bank vault."`
`This year, it was a very simple and cheap padlock.`
`......The lone girl protecting the shrine, Rika Furude, disliked the heavy locks, and consulted with the mayor...`
` who had replaced it with a simpler padlock.`
`"...So then the mayor and Rika Furude share the crime...?`
` So... then, after the mayor, wouldn't Rika Furude be in danger next?!"`
`"There's a decent possibility.`
` ...Kuma-chan.`
` I want you to contact all the cars we have in Hinamizawa.`
` Tell them to stick near the Furude Shrine."`
`"G-Got it!!!"`
