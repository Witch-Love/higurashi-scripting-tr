`<The Three Families>`
`"The Three Families" refers to the three old families who effectively came to rule Onigafuchi Village.`
`To break it down, there was the Kimiyoshi family, the Furude family, and the Sonozaki family, and each of them still exists today.`
`(Though they don't have as much control as they did in the remote past, they still hold considerable influence today.)`
`The Three Families are considered by legend to be those in whom the blood of the swamp demons runs the thickest.`
`<The Kimiyoshi Family>`
`The Kimiyoshi family appears to have held great power as the head of the Three Families, but it doesn't have that kind of leadership today.`
`The current mayor of the village (Kiichirou Kimiyoshi) is from this family.`
`The fact that members of the Kimiyoshi family are elected as mayor every generation is thought to be a remnant of the old system.`
`Of course, as no rival candidates appear, it doesn't change the fact that the Kimiyoshi family holds the mayoral office even through popular elections in the post-war era.`
`<The Furude Family>`
`The center of the village's faith since ancient times, the Furude clan has guarded the sole shrine dedicated to Oyashiro-sama.`
`They were worshipped as the only people to represent the voice of Oyashiro-sama for a long time, but the family branched off after the war and lost most of its power. It now consists of only the main house.`
`The main house, as well, presently consists of only one daughter (Rika Furude), so the lineage may end in this generation.`
`There is apparently an old tradition of honoring females of the Furude family, so the only daughter, Rika, is the subject of much respect among the elderly of the village.`
`<The Sonozaki Family>`
`It's said that this family had a certain police-like role of protecting the religious precepts of Onigafuchi Village.`
`Of the three families, their relatively weak position can be seen from me putting them here last.`
`Of course, today, the Sonozaki family is flourishing, and the state of affairs among the Three Families has completely reversed.`
`Even now, one could say that they are in control of Hinamizawa.`
`The three families conferring with each other is similar to the old wayâ€”the current head of the Sonozaki family, Oryou, essentially decides all of the goings-on in the village by herself.`
