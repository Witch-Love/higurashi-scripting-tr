`<The Problem With Twins>`
`This is not limited to just Hinamizawa, but in Onigafuchi Village especially, the Three Families detested giving birth to twins as successors.`
`The long-term dictatorship built on the precarious balance of the Three Families must have feared collapsing under the weight of internal strife from things like family quarrels.`
`According to the literature, if twins were born, then they had to be culled.`
`With that, the very fact that both the Sonozaki family successor, Mion Sonozaki, and her twin, Shion, are alive is in itself deeply interesting. (Perhaps the current leader, Oryou, is sympathetic?)`
`Of course, the twins were not cared for equally, and as the heir, Mion received special treatment.`
`(From what I've heard, despite the two of them looking exactly the same on the outside, the talent lies solely with Mion.`
` ...My own observations of the two of them don't leave me with that impression).`
`Tradition dictates that the leader of the Sonozaki family is said to 'inherit a demon,' and they tattoo a magnificent one onto his or her back. `
`In accordance with the tradition, there is an extremely high possibility that Mion has such a tattoo on her back.`
`From what I've heard, there is apparently a magnificent demon tattooed on Oryou's back as well.`
`Then... I wonder what sort of tattoo belongs to the heir, Mion.`
`...I really want to see her back.`
