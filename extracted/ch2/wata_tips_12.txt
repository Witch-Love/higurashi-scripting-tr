`<The Alleged Importance of the Implements>`
`I can't find anything that gives a concrete description on what the ritual implements were like.`
`They were, however, real, and there definitely existed a multitude of different kinds.`
`One source states that the implements used in the Watanagashi rite alone numbered two hundred.`
`The obvious question, then, is why they required such a myriad of them.`
`The rite of Watanagashi was to kidnap people through the 'demoning away,' dissect them, and eat them.`
`I believe the tools were for dissection and restraining, but two hundred of them is far too many.`
`Generally, tools evolve in such a way as to reach a solution for a certain problem.`
`Once you've reached the ultimate goal—that is, attained a certain level of efficiency—the tool's evolution normally stops there.`
`Regardless, why would they have created so many different kinds?`
`One of the cultural elements responsible for diversification over time is that of entertainment.`
`Tools used for entertainment would evolve over time and branch out.`
`Unlike normal tools, reaching the ultimate goal would be more of a dead end, and in searching for the next goal, they would split into many different subtypes.`
`So then, perhaps it's not a stretch to suggest that these two hundred-plus implements had some entertainment value.`
`This is just a hypothesis, of course, but maybe the human dissection process was viewed as a type of entertainment.`
`The Three Families of old would develop one new implement (dissection tool) after another, and each was varied, novel, and attracted spectators to keep them from growing bored...`
` It's not unimaginable.`
`All of them have to be enshrined within that storehouse.`
`There isn't much longer until the night of Watanagashi.`
`Though its original intent has been lost, I will reveal the secrets of the traditional ceremonial night within the ritual storehouse.`
`...I can't restrain my excitement.`
`Watanagashi cannot come soon enough.`
