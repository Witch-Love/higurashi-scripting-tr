`'Reserved for the day. ~Suzu Mahjong Parlor~'`
`Clatter-clack.`
`"Heya, Kura-chan. You're the last one here~`
` All the youngsters are here already."`
`"Na-ha-ha-ha...`
` Excuse me, miss."`
`Ooishi handed over a convenience store bag with a carton of cigarettes in it to the old lady who owned the mahjong parlor, and she shrewdly made herself scarce.`
` ...She was used to this by now.`
`"Ooishi-san!`
` Good work today!!"`
`"What, were you all earnestly waiting for me?`
` You could've just done three-player."`
`Everyone sitting at the mahjong tables in the small parlor were Ooishi's subordinates, but there were no tiles laid out anywhere.`
`"Everyone, I'd like to thank you for your days of investigation without sleep."`
`"""Thank you!!"""`
`Energetic responses filled the parlor.`
` ...Already, it had lost the atmosphere of a place of entertainment.`
`"The situation is not looking good.`
` The chief appears to have backed down due to Congressman Sonozaki's threats.`
`...That damn upstart chief.`
` The veterans in the room cursed him.`
`"All of our requests for warrants were turned down as well.`
` I've even been told by our section chief not to go anywhere near the Sonozaki house.`
` ...We're certainly in a bind, that we are.`
`Incidentally, it looks like I'll be getting orders soon to go to training at the Metropolitan Police Department starting next week.`
` After that I've even been told to take a paid vacation in Izu. `
`...Well, I suppose that ain't bad~"`
`He heard a few dry laughs.`
` ...It wasn't anything to laugh about, but that was all they could do.`
`For incidents?`
` Kuma-chan, show the map."`
`Kumagai flipped over the whiteboard.`
` On the back was a map of the Sonozaki premises made with magnets.`
`"Now, I've been doing this job for a looong time.`
` I've got a lot of faith in my gut, but this could be the one time it was wrong, no? `
`Anyone worried about their retirement money has until the count of ten to get out of here."`
`Ooishi began to count to ten, and everyone counted along with him.`
`......It was their famous ten-count resolution.`
`"Nine, ten!!`
` Ah, no one's leaving.`
` None of you love your families too much, is that it? Nfu-fu-fu!"`
`"""Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...!!"""`
`Everybody laughed uproariously, cheering things up.`
`"I want everyone to go over their materials.`
` Memorize the locations and blind spots of all the security cameras.`
` Kuma-chan, you'll stand by in the command car. `
`If something happens, you'll switch with me and take over.`
` Komiyama-kun will head up Infiltration Team A.`
` Atsushi-kun will lead team B.`
` Observation teams will set up at points one through eight. `
`Bonchi-kun, you're responsible for keeping a strict timetable.`
` Control your rotations so HQ doesn't get wise.`
` Now, the team on standby has the most important job, all right?`
` If the section chief asks where I am, play dumb."`
`"""Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"""`
`"I'll handle escorting our guest.`
`You can be sure I'll bring 'em to the venue, so wait patiently, everyone."`
`"...Wonder if he'll cave?`
` Keiichi Maebara, that is."`
`"From what I've seen, we're set for tomorrow or the day after in that regard.`
` It'll be easy.`
` Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"`
