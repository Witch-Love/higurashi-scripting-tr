`<The Significance of Watanagashi>`
`Watanagashi—a festival of hunting for sacrifices and feasting on them.`
`While the festival itself is remarkable, it has come to be considered a form of entertainment as well.`
`(Perhaps it was because of the disparity between being both an egregious act and a form of entertainment that the perpetrators began to believe themselves transcendent.)`
`However, I found some very interesting literature that appears to raise questions about that explanation.`
`As with most oral traditions, it's not easily swallowed, but it does mention a few things that spark my interest.`
`According to this literature, even the residents of Onigafuchi Village felt fear towards this ritual.`
`Women and children would grow pale and tremble, and those of weak constitution would vomit—but it said that the feast (the dissection) was an obligatory viewing.`
`This is an extremely curious tale.`
`Until now, I'd thought that the residents of Onigafuchi Village were fascinated by the Watanagashi ritual.`
`They looked down on those vulgar, barbaric humans, cut them open like fish,`
` and by eating them, they reaffirmed their own holiness... at least, that's what I thought.`
`However, if what the villagers gained from this ritual was not fascination, but fear, then that would suggest the ritual meant something entirely different.`
`There's the possibility that the executions were meant as warnings, encouraging the villagers to strictly follow religious precepts created by those with power for their own convenience.`
`Onigafuchi Village has been effectively ruled over by three old families, called the Three Families.`
`Without investigating the Three Families, I probably won't get any closer to the truth of Onigafuchi Village.`
