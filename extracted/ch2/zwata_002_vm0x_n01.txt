`"Alright! Everybody pay attention~!`
` I'm going to explain the rules~!!"`
`"...When I was in elementary school... there was a penalty game... yeah.`
` It can only be 'that.'`
` Schlepping!"`
`"...It says 'lipstick.'"`
`"Sa--`
` Sa-Sa--`
`Sakura can only mean that famous lipstick brand 'Sakura,' right!?!? `
`You know, the one in a new color they've been talking about on TV, they even did a special on it!`
` Don't you check these things out, as ladies?`
` Even I've seheheeen iiiiiiiiit!!!!"`
`"...Um yeah, even without the forced explanation, I know about it.`
` It's the one that doesn't stick to the cup even if you're drinking coffee, right?`
` Yeah.`
` I know, I know."`
`"Yup, yup.`
` It's a really kyute color, isn't it!`
` I saw it in the makeup section at the drug store.`
` That pink color made me want to take it home~"`
`"I-indeed.`
` It's only common sense for a lady to keep up on these matters!"`
`"I thought you were more interested in the bargain-sale tissues, Satoko."`
`"How rude of you! I make sure to keep an eye on the newest products!"`
`"That aside, it's just a bit surprising that's the first thing you think of when you hear 'Sakura'...`
`"Wh- whaaaat?`
` I was just thinking from a ladies perspective!!"`
`"Being born as a lady, obviously it's normal to maintain a beautiful image!`
` It's right to think thaaaaaaat!!`
` That's how it has to beeeeeeeee!!"`
`If o~nly you didn't have that one body part, you'd be a real girl~~!!"`
