`<The Sonozaki Family>`
`The one to drastically expand its influence after the war was the Sonozaki family.`
`The leader at the time was Oryou Sonozaki, who still has that seat today.`
`Oryou Sonozaki has grown old, and today you can only catch a glimpse of who she was at the time.`
`From what I've been told, however, she was a leader extolled as the best in history.`
`Having become so old, aside from going out a few times a week for lessons, she spends her time at home in solitude, and seems to leave most of the ceremonial affairs to her heir, Mion.`
`(There are different views on why the successor was not her daughter, but her granddaughter Mion, but it's rumored that it has to do with disownment of her daughter and son-in-law).`
`That uninhibited granddaughter, Mion Sonozaki, still shows no signs of the dignity required of the next leader.`
`However, she does have Sonozaki blood in her veins, and is permitted the name of 'demon.' `
`She still doubtlessly requires caution, and is probably hiding her fangs and claws (as skillfully as the leaders of the past did).`
