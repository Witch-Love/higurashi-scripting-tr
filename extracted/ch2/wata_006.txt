`The next day.`
`...It was a strange day, where Mion was desperate to regain her composure.`
`Every time our eyes met, she would say that she had something to do, or that she had to use the washroom, and run off.`
`Unable to just watch, Rena was taking care of her the entire time.`
`"...Mion-san... She's acting totally strange today."`
`"I know the whole story... but it's hard to explain..."`
`"...There are times when girls are emotionally unstable.`
` It's best to just leave her alone."`
`...Hm?`
`Turning around, I saw Rena calling me from the hallway.`
` ...I wondered what it was.`
`"Keiichi-kun, over here, over here."`
`"What is it, calling me over like this?`
` Is it a secret?"`
`"Ummm...`
` ...That is...`
` ...It looks like it was a disaster.`
` ...Ahahahahaha."`
`"Uh... Yea~h."`
`"Mii-chan seemed pretty broken, but I somehow got her working again."`
`"I'm surprised you managed it...`
` How did you exactly...?"`
`"Same way I do with the television.`
` Just come at it from a 45 degree angle and HIYAAAA!"`
`Saying that, she made a chopping motion.`
`...You know I can't tell if you're joking or not, right?`
`"She'll be fine by tomorrow.`
` Also, there's something I want you to do, Keiichi-kun."`
`"...I didn't mean to do anything wrong, but I still feel guilty.`
` ...I'm listening."`
`"Thanks.`
` ...You see, Mii-chan is just going to pretend the last few days never happened."`
`Never happened, huh...`
` ...I see... well, that's one way to run from it...`
`"So, you see...`
` Keiichi-kun, could you pretend too?`
` Then Mii-chan can go back to normal."`
`"J-Just doing something as simple as that... is it really going to be okay...?"`
`"Please, until Mii-chan gets her feelings in order, just go with it."`
`"...Okay...`
` ...`
`I got it."`
`Even though I shouldn't have been at fault... for some reason I felt guilty.`
`The one at fault here was the one who knew about the entire situation and pretended to be Mion for an entire day: Shion...!!!`
`Ugh... but... she never once said that she was Mion...`
` ...Ugh...`
` What am I supposed to be angry at!?`
`Seeing me stomping the ground impatiently, Rena giggled.`
`"But Keiichi-kun, you knew as well.`
` That Mii-chan has some cute things about her."`
`Rena talked in a calm voice as her hair rustled in the wind.`
`"......Yeah.`
` I know that she'll never let it be boring."`
`"...Good."`
`Following this curt reply, Rena looked up at the sky and stretched.`
`"As long as you realize that, Keiichi-kun, these past few days will soon be nothing more than a story to laugh about."`
`Copying Rena, I also began to stretch as I looked at the sky.`
`The clear sky towered into the distance.`
`"There's no club activities or anything today.`
` I'm sorry, Keiichi-kun, but just for today, can you go home by yourself?`
` It'll all be back to normal by tomorrow, so just for today.`
` ...Okay?"`
`If all it took for everything to go back to normal was to leave Mion alone for today, then it was an easy decision to make.`
`"Got it.`
` ...I can't say it directly to Mion, so I'll say it to you.`
` ...I still feel kind of guilty about it. So I want to apologize..."`
`"...Ah, no!`
` The root of the problem was Keiichi-kun saying something insensitive, right?`
` So if you learned anything from this, you need to look a bit into gaining a sense of delicacy."`
`"Right, right. I'll try."`
`That day, was the shortest day of my life.`
`Rena was talking to Mion while accompanying her around the entire time.`
`It looked like a really fun conversation, so I reflexively thought about joining in, but I had made a promise not to.`
`It seemed that Mion was also trying her best to ignore me.`
`...So likewise, I did my best to ignore her.`
`For the first time in a while, I ate lunch alone.`
`Mion and Rena ate theirs by themselves.`
`As I let out a sigh in my ashen mood, Rika-chan came over and patted me on the head.`
`"...Both Keiichi and Mii learned a whole lot."`
`I'd never say it like that.`
` ...It made it sound like we were having romantic problems. I didn't like that one bit.`
`Hopefully the teacher wouldn't notice and call us to the staff room after school or something...`
`"...I'm sure that Keiichi will grow up to be a wonderful adult.`
` ...*pat pat*"`
`"...Hmmm.`
` ...Rika-chan is the studious type, so maybe you'll grow up to be an amazingly wonderful adult?"`
`"...Of course.`
` When I grow up I'll be super amazing."`
`"My, when I grow up I'll be an amazing lady, you know?"`
`"No matter how old you get, you'll still be a brat. You can put money on it."`
`"Wha-Wha-Wha-What did you saaaaaaaaaAAaaaaay!?!?"`
`As Satoko snapped her fingers a washbasin fell from above, hitting me squarely in the head.`
`"Owwwwwww....`
` What do you think you're doing SatokooooooooOooo!!!!"`
`*bang* *smash*`
` *pinch* *squeeze*`
` It was a day I could thoroughly appreciate the value of having friends.`
