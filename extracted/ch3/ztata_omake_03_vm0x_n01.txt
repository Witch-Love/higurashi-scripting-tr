`"It's no big deal.`
` As you probably already know,`
` a brand new chapter is being added. And I, Sonozaki Shion, will be the main character."`
`If the rumors are right, you got even more voiced lines than me?!`
` Ha-hah! Get a small taste of my suffering~!!"`
`Personally, I wanted to get a scene depicting the tragedy unfolding after the disaster struck—do you all think so too?"`
` Now here are our guests that debuted in this chapter.`
` You had too many appearances, too much dialogue, and too strong a role for a minor character."`
` I don't know how much I'll get to appear from hereon, so please root for me!"`
` Next up is our teacher, Chie-sensei~!!"`
` I've appeared in various scenes, and this time I was given that memorable scene, the curry showdown.`
` ...I just can't forgive those who would slight curry."`
` N-Nobody here would even think of it!`
`"Meaning that the restaurant I visited during the story must have been part of the Sonozaki group.`
` Since the Sonozaki family runs various eateries and businesses around these parts."`
`"...I was scary in Onikakushi, but that wasn't only because it was Onikakushi...`
` it was because my character was the exact same in all three stories, is that it?"`
`"If we think from the perspective of a general adventure game in the suspense genre... sometimes the story branches depending on choices, right?"`
`"So in Watanagashi, the point where you do or don't give the doll to my sister?"`
`"Well then, returning to the topic of Tatarigoroshi.`
` Hmm, this time round... maybe whether you decide to kill the uncle or not."`
` ...I think it branched back when the uncle's cohabitant disappeared because of some trouble and he returned to Hinamizawa."`
` ...If we were more understanding of Keiichi-san's feelings...`
` And if Ooishi-san and my uncle hadn't appeared... would we not have spent our time in peace, without anything happening?"`
` Next time I'll make sure to be merciless in the pain I put you through!!`
` You can cry and apologize as much as you like, it won't work!!!`
`"Sinking a ritual offering into the Onigafuchi Swamp, right!"`
`"...A-An offering? ...What do you suggest is offered to Oyashiro-sama?"`
` Someone who is destined to drop out from the story no matter what happens!`
`"...Uhh...`
` ...When you say someone who drops out no matter what...`
` you're talking about me, aren't you?"`
`"Hiya, my name's Uncle Houjou~."`
`"...Why is Coach playing my Uncle?"`
`"Going to get him would be pretty tedious, wouldn't it?"`
` I'm so lonely and blue because my lover ran away~♪. `
`Time to go back to Hinamizawa, take Satoko-chan home, train her, and make her into my future maid servant~~♪.`
` Oh no, all of a sudden, this arm of mine is glowing with an awesome power☆."`
` Isn't it about time we told them about it?"`
` I suspect that some people already figured it out, but okay."`
` The late-appearing sister of a pair is always popular, it's been that way since the golden era of galge♪."`
` Anyway, I've been fired from my main character post for once! `
`"Well, Kei-chan has such a ridiculous number of voiced lines I'm sure that'll be turned around in the other scenarios.`
` Anyway, be prepared to experience the true prowess of the Sonozaki sisters."`
`"With Tatarigoroshi and the side story Someutsushi, we've hit a landmark point in the Higurashi: When They Cry series. `
`This first half presented a lot of strange and exciting mysteries, but starting next time...`
` we'll start to challenge the mysteries from the next chapter, which will set the stage for yet more drama."`
` You'll get too close to the Three Families' secrets, be imprisoned, and then get tormented!`
` You're a shoo-in to meet a violent, unnatural death!!"`
