`......The ceiling... blurred into view.`
`...It was hot.`
`...There was a thin layer... of moist sweat on me.`
`...The voices of the cicadas permeating my room... were somehow grating to my head.`
`".........Wha...t...`
` Today's... not Sunday... is it...?"`
`I remembered today was a weekday... and quickly brought myself to consciousness.`
`And then, finally, I leaped out of bed.`
`The clock... read a little before 10.`
` ...I was... totally late.`
`...When I wandered downstairs, my mom would get mad at me.`
` ...There was nothing I could do, though.`
`After reviewing the schedule for the school day for a moment, I suitably rearranged the stuff in my bag.`
`I hurried and got dressed, then went down the stairs.`
`"............"`
`There was no sign of my parents anywhere.`
`...Maybe they went out somewhere together.`
`So that's how it was.`
`...My mother had probably woken me up once this morning, but then I fell back asleep without remembering it.`
`...And my parents, thinking I'd gone to school, left.`
` ...Something like that probably happened.`
`...I went to the front door, and as I expected, it was locked.`
`Looked like I was right.`
` It was further evidence of my speculation being correct.`
`When I realized my parents weren't here, I suddenly felt less like I had to rush to get to school.`
`There was one portion of breakfast left in the dining room.`
`...Probably mine.`
`...The milk they'd poured in it had gone warm since a while ago.`
`...When I realized how hard it would be to sneak food for Satoko...`
` yesterday, I had cried.`
`Well... Thinking back on it, food wasn't the only issue in that regard...`
` I wasn't in a position where I could care for for Satoko by myself anyway.`
`...It's such a heavy thing just to save a single person.`
`I'd seen this on TV and in comics all the time...`
` Those feel-good words, about how you'll save your friends for sure, and such.`
`...Was that why I ran my mouth like that, swearing to save her—because I wanted to feel good about it...?`
`No... That absolutely wasn't true.`
`...Because the fact was I couldn't save her.`
`Because I didn't want to think like an adult... like I couldn't do anything but watch.`
`...Had Satoko gone to school today...?`
`I immediately realized that was a meaningless question.`
`...Whether or not she did... there wouldn't be a change in the environment she'd been placed in.`
`If I couldn't save her, and no one else could either......`
` then we could only pray for a miracle.`
`"......Are we...`
` so powerless...`
` ...?"`
`With a vague goal of getting to school in mind... I sluggishly put on my shoes and stumbled out the front door.`
`I had only overslept by two or three hours, but the sunlight and air felt completely different from how they usually were in the morning.`
`...Well, of course they did.`
` Once ten o'clock came around, you could barely call it morning anymore.`
`......I didn't feel like walking the same old route to school.`
`I needed to ultimately end up there, but it was like... I didn't want to choose the shortest route, the most proactive one, to get to school.`
`...Put in a more positive light, maybe I wanted some time to walk by myself and think.`
`I had to go to school.`
` ...Partly to make sure Satoko was safe.`
`But... I hadn't come up with any plans yet.`
` ...Nothing since last night.`
`...So the path I took from my house was in the complete opposite direction.`
`...If I went this way, I'd pass Rena's house... and the dam site.`
`...It would be quite a detour.`
`I calculated how long of a detour it would end up being, then, satisfied with the answer, I started to walk...`
`...Rena had brought me to the dam site a few times.`
`One section of it had turned into an unlawful, oversized garbage dump, and Rena really liked going fishing for junk in there.`
`...Without that, she'd come off as a completely normal girl, too.`
` (...I can think of a few other qualities she could do without... but whatever...)`
`The view quickly opened up wide, and I was hit by a strong wind.`
` ...There was no shelter... here at this big dam site.`
`...Maybe it was a good thing I came here, I thought.`
`...At the very least, it was more healthy to think about stuff in a place like this instead of my cramped bedroom.`
`I took a deep breath and filled my lungs with the rich, cold air unique to Hinamizawa.`
`...Ring rrring.`
`I turned around reflexively. It was a bicycle bell.`
`...Considering where I was standing, I don't think they were trying to get me out of the way.`
` ...They'd rang the bell because they wanted something from me.`
`"Could you tell me how to get to the Furude Shrine from here?`
` I think I left my map at the inn.`
` I don't know where to go!"`
`"The shrine, from here?`
` .........Hmm..."`
`I knew where everything was in my head, but explaining how to get there was difficult.`
`I was a little irritated at having been bothered for this... but when I realized it meant my detour actually meant something, that feeling faded quickly.`
`"I'll tell you... but it's a little difficult to explain.`
` ...I could bring you there, if you don't mind."`
`"Really?!`
` I would be in your debt.`
` Thanks a lot!`
` ......But are you sure?`
` Did you have something to do?"`
`Tomitake-san finally appeared to have realized how strange it was for a student like me to be here at this time of day.`
`I smoothly told him not to worry about it, then turned my back and started walking towards the Furude Shrine.`
`Tomitake-san hurried to turn his bike around and came after me.`
`"Ah-ha-ha, sorry, sorry!`
` Don't worry—all guys have times when they need to split up from the pack and be lone wolves for a while."`
`...What a free-minded freelancer.`
` It was easier for me, too, that he was under that impression.`
`Along the way, Tomitake-san spoke at length to me about how precious the nature in Hinamizawa was and how it was a treasure trove of rare wild birds, despite my not having asked.`
`...I wasn't interested in what he had to say, but he seemed to be enjoying himself, so I left him to it.`
`"These steps will take you up to the shrine grounds."`
`"Thank you!`
` You really helped me out!`
` ......Hmm... I think I'm a little late."`
`As Tomitake-san mumbled to himself, he left his bicycle nearby and started to climb the stairs quickly.`
`......I didn't have a watch, but as far as my internal clock could guess, it was still a little late in the morning.`
`...School wasn't very far from here.`
`......Maybe I could kill a little more time until then.`
`With that in mind, I went up the steps in pursuit of Tomitake-san.`
`When I reached the top of the long staircase... I arrived at the wide-open shrine grounds that were too grand-looking for this tiny village.`
`...Tomitake-san... oh, there he is.`
`...It looked like he was supposed to be meeting someone here.`
`Then he got lost and ended up being late.`
` ...He was bowing to a lady who must have been the person he was meeting.`
`That lady... I knew her.`
`".........Oh, is that you, Maebara-kun?`
` Hello there.`
` Are you off from school today?"`
`"What?`
` Oh, Maebara-kun, you followed me...?!"`
`"I-I wasn't really planning to.`
` ...I just wanted to kill some time."`
`"Oh my.`
` ...Arriving at work late like an executive—how refined! You certainly are famous, taking the time to look like a bigshot."`
`...What was I, a celebrity??`
`...Well, she did say my name out of nowhere, anyway.`
`...I was oddly concerned about what she meant by "famous."`
`"Oh, you still can't remember my name?`
` ...Hee hee."`
`"This is Miyo Takano-san.`
` She works at the village clinic.`
` Maebara-kun, you seem healthy, so you probably haven't been to the hospital much, have you?"`
`"Hee hee...`
` Now that we're finally acquaintances, the next time you're sick or anything, I suppose I'll give you a little bit of special treatment.`
` ...Hee hee!"`
`This lady named Takano-san... I kind of didn't remember her.`
`...Maybe we'd passed each other on the street a few times, but I was pretty sure this was the first time we'd talked.`
`Well, this is Hinamizawa—even if I don't know a person's name, it's not unusual for them to know mine.`
`...I glanced at Takano-san and saw she had a bag and a camera.`
`"...Are you photography partners?`
` Was that why you were meeting each other?"`
`"Oh, we're nothing like partners.`
` I am but an amateur, and Jirou-san is gently initiating me into it.`
` Right...?"`
`"Mm... ha-ha-ha...!`
` T-That's not it at all!`
` Takano-san is a quick learner—she could take pictures just fine without my guidance!`
` I mean it.`
` Ah-ha-ha-ha...!"`
`......I couldn't tell which of them was ahead in the conversation.`
`...Well, they were certainly one couple you wouldn't get tired of watching.`
`"The festival is finally coming up the day after tomorrow.`
` I hope I can take some good pictures this year."`
`"I plan on taking some shots of the set-up tomorrow.`
` I want to capture the festival energy shown by the preparations for it, too."`
`Oh... I just remembered.`
` There was some village festival called 'Watanagashi' or something the day after tomorrow, on Sunday...`
`"They hold a service with a pile of old futons, in order to give thanks to Hinamizawa's guardian deity, Oyashiro-sama... I think?"`
`"Oh, you're correct.`
` ...You have quite extensive knowledge despite just having moved here.`
` ...Yes, it is a festival... to give thanks to Oyashiro-sama.`
` .........Hehe."`
`Takano-san smiled somehow meaningfully, but didn't tell me what part of a festival to thank Oyashiro-sama needed to be laughed at.`
`"...Cryptic as ever, Takano-san.`
` ......But I do wonder what will happen this year."`
`"You know what they say—if it happens twice, it'll happen a third time.`
` And it's already happened four times.`
` I think there's less evidence that it won't happen a fifth time, don't you think...?"`
`I knew what they meant by their whispered exchange.`
`...On the day of Watanagashi...`
`A freak death always occurs, which people call 'Oyashiro-sama's curse'—and a disappearance occurs that people call being 'demoned away.'`
`These strange events had happened four years running... and Watanagashi, rapidly approaching the day after tomorrow, marked the fifth...`
`"Oyashiro-sama puts a curse on enemies of the village, eh?`
` ...If it does happen this year... I wonder... who will find themselves at gunpoint? `
`...Oh, and I always come here to pray and donate money whenever I visit!`
` It won't be me for sure."`
`"...Oh, is that so?`
` They say that Oyashiro-sama has been especially harsh on outsiders recently, you know.`
` Maebara-kun may have only just moved in, but he's a proper member of Hinamizawa... `
`But you, Jirou-san, are a stranger who only comes once a year.`
` ...I wonder... will he let you go this year?"`
`"Th-That's harsh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha...!"`
`Tomitake-san was the only one with a pained grin, but we all were smiling, me included.`
`...Oyashiro-sama—the one who used a curse to kill people involved with the dam construction project, one after the next.`
`He killed the dam construction manager,`
`killed Satoko's parents for supporting it...`
`and the next year, he even killed her aunt.`
`If the demoning away was part of that curse, then you could add Satoshi to the list of victims.`
`...As I thought about it,`
`I realized that in the serial freak death incidents, the overwhelming majority had the last name Houjou.`
`Half of the deaths and disappearances had come from the Houjou family.`
`...The Houjou family lived here in Hinamizawa.`
`...Did that mean Oyashiro-sama punished and cursed them particularly harshly because despite that, they had been in favor of the dam?`
`"......Have you heard the news that Satoko's uncle has returned?"`
`Takano-san, who had been enjoying a few words with Tomitake-san, was caught unaware by my sudden inquiry.`
`"Oh, I'm sorry.`
` What was that?"`
`"Umm... Satoko's parents were killed by the curse, and her aunt, too.`
` ...So I was wondering if, maybe if you went in order... her uncle would be next. `
`...Her aunt had a miserable death from the curse last year... and her uncle let his fear take over and fled into town, right?`
` ...Oyashiro-sama doesn't allow people to try and abandon the village, does he...?"`
`...I hadn't intended to be quite this persistent.`
`But those words... They just flowed out of my mouth without me thinking about it.`
`...Right.`
` Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
`...I didn't believe in something so unrealistic, of course... but the fact was that every year, unfortunate accidents and incidents happened to enemies of the village.`
`Like Takano-san said just now... it had happened four times.`
` No one could say there wouldn't be a fifth.`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...That's an interesting suggestion.`
` It is true that if you look at those sacrificed in previous years, those named 'Houjou' come up quite frequently. `
`...Given how long it's gone on for... Her uncle being the one to die or disappear this year isn't out of the question.`
` ...Hee hee hee."`
`"...Not again, Takano-san.`
` Don't laugh about it—it could really happen!"`
`"Ufufufufu, I'm sorry.`
` But Oyashiro-sama's curse is my life's work.`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`Takano-san gave off a mysterious, somehow intellectual impression... and her life's work was mysterious in its own right.`
`...She probably really liked inexplicable supernatural phenomena or something.`
`"...Takano-san, you seem like you know a lot about Oyashiro-sama.`
` ...Give me your honest thoughts.`
` ...Given that he's a Houjou and that he's returned, what are the chances that the uncle will fall to the curse?"`
`"...My, what?`
` ...You seem like you really want this uncle of hers dead.`
` Hee hee."`
`"...That... that's not..."`
`"Ah, ahahahahaha!`
` Hmm... I wonder?`
` ...It all depends on the whims of God..."`
`"...Maebara-kun.`
` Do you know the true identity of Santa Claus?"`
`Huh?`
` I got a strange question all of a sudden, and I couldn't immediately answer.`
`"What, you don't know?`
` ......It's your daddy.`
` The daddies in everyone's family."`
`"...W-What?`
` ...That's what you meant?`
` Well, of course.`
` Everything ultimately comes down to humans in the end. `
`After all, humans are the only ones living in the world.`
` All strange things should be explainable in terms of human actions."`
`I felt like I put that somewhat strangely, but Takano-san was not as dissatisfied with that reply as I might have guessed.`
`"Oh... It's impressive that you've caught on to that at such a young age. You're right.`
` Strange things that happen in the world of man are all caused by man for his own benefit. `
`...Maebara-kun, I'll ask you again then.`
` This time, not Santa Claus,`
` ...but Oyashiro-sama.`
` ...Do you know anything... about who Oyashiro-sama is?"`
`Takano-san... took a step towards me and gazed into my eyes... as she asked.`
`...Santa Claus was really the parents of every family's children.`
`If lionizing that legend was a corporate tactic to try and profit during Christmas sales, then...`
` what was Oyashiro-sama, really?`
`"...Um... hmm..."`
`"Oh... Didn't you already say?`
` There are only humans in this world.`
` Everything can be explained by human actions, right?`
` ...Hee hee."`
`"......Maebara-kun.`
` Keep this to yourself, okay?`
` ...This string of freak death incidents attributed to Oyashiro-sama's curse... `
`Takano-san's view is that they may be premeditated homicides, performed by the people of Hinamizawa and based on some kind of ceremony."`
`"No, don't misunderstand me.`
` My life's work is to research teachings, thoughts, and cultures from the viewpoint of folklorism. `
`I don't really care at all about who the culprit really is...`
` Just keep that in mind, please."`
`...Umm...... I could tell only that she was saying some crazy stuff.`
`...To use a food analogy, like you'd force-feed a duck to be fattened, she forced her words down my throat, that's what it felt like.`
`"To understand that in the first place, you have to go all the way back to ancient times, when Hinamizawa was called Onigafuchi—or 'the Demon's Abyss.' `
`The transcendents who lived there believed themselves to carry the blood of demons, and so were only half-human—"`
`Takano-san, having entered her home field, leaned forward and began to speak of ridiculous matters.`
`...Tomitake-san realized she was overawing me and interrupted for me.`
`"Takano-san, Takano-san.`
` You can't just chatter on about that stuff to Maebara-kun...`
` Look, he's really confused."`
`".........Oh, my... Are you?`
` If you want to hear more, ask me anytime.`
` I have heaps of the grotesque stories that boys your age seem to love hearing."`
`"...T-Thank you.`
` If I feel like it, I will..."`
`For now, I softly and safely gave my refusal...`
`Takano-san seemed a little unhappy that Tomitake-san had rained on her parade, but she stopped talking about it then.`
`Even so... it was still a very interesting story.`
`......That Oyashiro-sama's curse, which we thought of as strange, freak deaths...`
` were really homicides...`
` perpetrated by people of the village.`
`"Well, I mean... If you thought about it logically, it would have to be.`
` ...People wouldn't be dying because of a curse.`
` ...Someone's obviously killing people and making it look like one."`
`"Indeed.`
` ...As for who that is... Hee hee, it might be safer not to try and find out."`
`"......You seem like you know, Takano-san.`
` ...You may not have proof... but you seem like you believe it."`
`"Oh, my... Why do you think that?"`
`I just kind of felt it vaguely.`
`...It didn't seem like her extreme passion for this research would calm down just because these things were taboo, or because it was safer and easier.`
`This person... loved walking through the profound, forbidden abyss of risks and taboos.`
` ...I just helped you escape, and now you're trying to talk about Oyashiro-sama again!`
` ...Hmm... I wanted to take a nice walk while it was still cool..."`
`Tomitake-san seemed a little disappointed not to be able to go on the date he'd planned since I had brought up a weird topic.`
`......But right now... there was something I wanted to ask, just for a little bit.`
`...And that was......`
`...About whether... Satoko's uncle... will be chosen for the curse this year.`
`...If he was............ then...`
` another miracle would happen, just like last year.`
`...A terrible incident would happen again... but it would release Satoko from her unfortunate circumstances once more.`
`"......Well.`
` I do have a few suspicions as to the kind of people who would probably become involved, of course. `
`It's a natural, inevitable conclusion for anyone who's researched the history of Onigafuchi Village..."`
`"...Who... do you mean?"`
`...What would I do if I knew?`
`...I asked that question to the other me deep inside... but got no reply.`
`"How enthusiastic.`
` ...What would you do if you knew?"`
`"......Nothing really."`
`"...If you found out, you might get into danger yourself, you know?`
` Maybe the fifth year's curse would be you...`
` Hee hee."`
`Takano-san, toying with taboo, gave a devilish, satisfied smile... as though nothing in the world would be more amusing.`
`...She was probably trying to tease me, but I didn't feel like going along with her little game one bit.`
`"...Hmm.`
` ...You like to talk pretty big... but you don't really know yourself, do you, Takano-san?"`
`I had felt a tinge of irritation at Takano-san's roundabout way of speaking...`
` but those emotions escaped my mouth... like water flowing through a strainer.`
`...Even I was surprised at how directly I had spoken out about what I felt.`
` ...Of course, I wasn't the only one taken aback..`
`"......Oh, my.`
` ...You're something.`
` You may be just a boy, but you can still provoke people.`
` How unexpectedly rugged.`
` ......I don't dislike people like that, you know."`
`Takano-san's tongue poked out of her mouth... and I was convinced that it was long, thin, and split in the middle like a snake's.`
`"All right.`
` ...I'll tell you, then."`
`"........."`
`"...But you have to promise me three things first.`
` ...One, not to regret it, no matter what I tell you.`
` Two, not to tell it to anyone.`
` Three, not to tell anyone I told you."`
`I gulped firmly... and nodded.`
`Tomitake-san made an exaggerated expression of distress, gave a dry, vague smile, and lit a cigarette.`
`"Please tell me.`
` ...Who is putting this curse on people?`
` Who is it... who's deciding who gets cursed?!"`
`...And after I said that... I finally realized why I wanted to know...`
`Many of my classmates were playing freely in the schoolyard.`
`A few of them had just run out of the school building after putting on their shoes and tapping their toes to the ground.`
`...It looked like they had just finished eating lunch.`
` ...From a time-manipulating standpoint, I guess I succeeded.`
`"Oh... Maebara-saan!`
` Are you okay...?!"`
`A few girls noticed me and came running over.`
`...It was only natural they were worried.`
`You'd think if someone wasn't there in the morning, they'd be out the rest of the day.`
`"Well, I'm... just late for school.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` ...Anyway... What about Satoko?`
` ...Did she come today?"`
`The girls exchanged glances.`
`...I saw a thin shadow fall over their faces and knew the answer without needing to hear them reply.`
`...Satoko... was absent today too.`
`When all was said and done, after being out three days, she'd only come back for one.`
`And now she was out again.`
` ...Who knew if she would come tomorrow?`
`"...Yeah.`
` But the teacher said she got a phone call from Satoko-chan."`
`"She said she had a cold!`
` Chie-sensei said everyone should make sure to rinse their mouths out really well!"`
`...Wait a minute, Chie-sensei.`
`...That's a little too thickheaded, don't you think...?`
` You're a teacher, aren't you?`
` Why can't you be more sensitive and catch on to the fact that your pupil is sending out an SOS...?`
`But... Even if she did, there was nothing we could hope for.`
`...The most she could do was a home visitation.`
`...She didn't have any right to take Satoko from her uncle into safety.`
` ...No matter the result, it would end up just like the public agencies—with a 'wait and see' attitude.`
`...It would just piss Satoko's uncle off... and her suffering would only grow deeper...`
`...Then wasn't saying she had a cold the best option?`
`"...She's right.`
` Be careful not to catch a cold, got it?`
` ...You can go now.`
` There's still plenty of time left in lunch break."`
`The girls excitedly scattered into the schoolyard.`
`"...Oh... Keiichi-kuuun!!!"`
`Rena was yelling out the classroom window, waving her hand.`
`...A moment later, Mion and Rika-chan poked their heads out too.`
`"...We were very worried... that even you would be absent today."`
`"Thank goodness!`
` You don't seem sick—you look pretty okay!"`
`...I felt a little uncomfortable with her saying that I didn't look sick, but I didn't care that much.`
`"...What happened?`
` Overslept?"`
`"......Well, late is late.`
` ...Think if I said I was late because of a train accident, she'd let it slide?"`
`"......You overslept?"`
`...Mion was being a bit persistent.`
`Was she going to put on her club president cap and scold me for being late?`
` ...Well, maybe she didn't have it in for me, so I briefly stated that she was right.`
`"There's still more bento!`
` Everyone eat up!`
` Without Keiichi-kun here, we couldn't have any fun!"`
`"...Satoko... is still absent, huh?"`
`...Even Rena, feigning cheerfulness, couldn't stand to hear that, and her face darkened.`
`"............"`
`"She called this morning.`
` ...Apparently she said her cold came back and she was staying home again.`
` She said it might go on for a while, too."`
`"...She must be sad, so we were all talking about going to visit."`
`"...What are you saying, Rika-chan?"`
`Not pleased with Rika-chan wearing a wide smile as though it was a happy occasion, I threw cold water on her.`
`"We know best of all she doesn't have a cold, don't we?`
` ...Don't ever tell a fib like that again, even as a joke.`
` ...I'll get mad next time."`
`......Rika-chan furrowed her brow, looked down... and mumbled an apology.`
`"...It's not just you, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...It's hard... for everyone..."`
`"I know I'm not the only one worrying.`
` But none of us can do anything either, can we?"`
`".........That's... true, but...`
` ...B-But...!"`
`...I got the feeling I would cause another fight if this exchange went on.`
` So I apologized first.`
`"Sorry.`
` ...I'm sorry, so forget about what I just said.`
` ...It's hard for everyone, right?`
` ...It must be."`
`It was at least clear, however, that I was the only one who had worried so much about rescuing her.`
`...At the very least, everyone else probably got the normal amount of sleep last night.`
` Probably had good dreams, too.`
` ...They definitely hadn't... stayed up all night thinking so desperately...`
`"...I know it might not be what you want to hear right after you get to school...`
` But you were late today, Kei-chan.`
` ...Did it have anything to do with Satoko being absent?"`
`"Huh...?!`
` Mion, what are you talking about...?"`
`"...Sometimes you act kind of foolhardy, Kei-chan.`
`...When both you and her were absent this morning...`
` We seriously thought you might have kidnapped her and hidden her somewhere."`
`...Easy for you to say.`
`If I could have, I'd have done that last night.`
`...None of them had really thought... about how difficult that clear-as-day solution was.`
`I was... up thinking all night, thinking until the night was brightening.`
`...And then...`
` I concluded that...`
` I couldn't do anything of the sort.`
`"...Don't be dumb.`
` ...I couldn't... I couldn't hide someone."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I'm sorry.`
` I apologize if I upset you."`
`"Don't worry about it.`
` ...Anyway, let's eat some food.`
` I'm starving!"`
`I took my bento box out of my bag.`
`Everyone moved to make a spot for me to sit.`
`"Maebara-kun...!`
` Did you just get here?"`
`And just as I was about to stick my chopsticks in... Chie-sensei came along.`
`"Uh... yeah.`
` ...Sorry for being late.`
` I overslept."`
`"..............."`
`...What the heck?`
`Even the teacher... was giving me that strange look.`
`"When you're finished eating, could you and the president come to the teacher's lounge?`
` ...There's something I want to talk about."`
` ......Probably about Satoko, I thought.`
`Sensei left it at that and went back out into the hallway.`
`"...Eating lunch can wait.`
` ...Let's go, Mion."`
`"Mm... You're right."`
`Mion and I exchanged looks, nodded to each other, and got up.`
`"...It's probably... about Satoko-chan."`
`No doubt about it.`
`...They were saying she had a cold, but everyone in class knew the truth.`
`...I didn't think that wouldn't have reached the teacher's ears by now.`
`"......I kept playing dumb... so I think she gave up asking me."`
`...Revealing the truth to the teacher would only worsen the situation.`
` ...Was that why she hadn't said anything?`
`...Or was it... because she was Satoko's friend...`
` and knew that she was trying to endure... the trial of her uncle's abuse... in order to get her brother to come home?`
`"...What should we do?`
` ...Maybe we should use this chance to get a collective opinion."`
`"......What do you want to do, Rika-chan?"`
`"......Meep..."`
`Satoko's closest and best friend was Rika-chan.`
`...However much I pretended to be her Nii-nii... it didn't come close to the amount of time they'd spent together.`
`...So I felt like her opinion should be held in the highest regard.`
`"......I know... why Satoko is enduring her uncle's torture."`
`Everyone looked startled... and turned to me.`
`"...Back then, whenever Satoko was... abused... she probably cried and hid behind her brother.`
` ...But Satoko thinks that... in the end...`
` that's why her brother ran away."`
`"............"`
`"......Who... did you hear that from...?"`
`"The coach, I bet..."`
`I nodded quietly.`
`"...Satoko believes her brother will come back if she can withstand the abuse... maybe that's why she's trying to push through. `
`But... that assumption has nothing to do with Satoshi coming back.`
` ...It hurts to say that about Satoko... but it's the truth."`
`Everyone... hung their heads.`
`...Everyone... was thinking the same thing...`
`"...Satoko... probably won't be happy no matter who helps her.`
` ...She wants to withstand everything with her own strength.`
` .........But is it... really right to respect that...?`
` ...I don't think it is. `
`...Even if Satoko hates us for a while... I think there will come a time when we need to save her against her will.`
` ...And I think... that time might be now."`
`...I told them all about what I saw and how I felt when I went to Satoko's house yesterday.`
`"......Keiichi-kun... so you think... we should tell someone?"`
`"Of course, only after we're sure that reporting it to a public agency will guarantee her safety.`
` ...Without being sure of that, it could just get more dangerous for her instead."`
`"...It's a difficult problem.`
` ...You think we can get a definite promise out of the teacher?"`
`I had no confidence.`
` ...But we had to try.`
`Meanwhile... Rika-chan had her hand raised for a while... as if asking for an opportunity to speak.`
`"...I will... leave it to Keiichi."`
`"What... Is that okay, Rika-chan...?"`
`"...Keiichi is... thinking about Satoko more than anybody else here.`
` ...If Keiichi thinks... that we need to tell someone, then I have no complaints."`
`"...Thanks... Mion, Rena, are you okay with that?"`
`Mion seemed to hesitate, not knowing if she should agree.`
`...But when she saw Rena's firm nod, she made up her mind and did the same.`
`"Okay.`
` ...Let's go, Mion."`
`"...Right."`
`Only Chie-sensei was in the teacher's lounge.`
`...We didn't see the principal anywhere.`
`...The schedule on the blackboard under the principal's name said "training—going straight home."`
`...Our principal's sense of justice was too strong.`
`...Satoko's problems wouldn't be solved with something so vague.`
` ...Maybe it was a stroke of good luck that he wasn't here.`
`When the teacher saw Mion and I come in, she closed up her curry bento, saving the rest for later.`
`"Sit over there, please."`
`She told us to take a seat in the chairs directly in front of the principal's seat.`
`...I hadn't sat in this chair since doing the paperwork for transferring in.`
`The two of us sat there uncomfortably... before the teacher walked over carrying a notebook and a ballpoint pen and sat in front of us.`
`"Maebara-kun, you were absent this morning—did something happen?"`
`"I'm sorry, I overslept."`
`"......Really?"`
`"...I have no reason to lie..."`
`She narrowed her eyes at me in suspicion.`
`...Now I was sure of it.`
`...She wanted to talk about Satoko.`
`"...In any case, I think you two already know, but your friend Houjou-san has been away frequently lately."`
`Neither Mion nor I had anything to say in response.`
` ...But the teacher proceeded, not minding.`
`"...Would you happen to know anything?`
` There are some people in class spreading bad rumors."`
`Mion looked down and remained silent, as though she were being lectured.`
`......She sent me a quick glance.`
` ...Everyone had made up their minds.`
` ...They'd be leaving things to me.`
`"Mion-kun?`
` Or you, Maebara-kun?`
` ...I won't get mad or anything, okay?`
` If you know something, I just want you to tell me."`
`"......Sensei.`
` Can we ask you a question first?"`
`She must not have anticipated that response.`
` ...She looked surprised.`
`"...I don't know what rumors are going around about Satoko in class.`
` ...But if those rumors happened to be true... what would you do, Sensei?"`
`"W-Well, what would I do?`
`"Can't leave what alone, exactly? What would you do?"`
`Sensei's eyebrows shot up.`
` ...Maybe I said it like I was trying to pick a fight.`
`"Maebara-kun!`
` I'm being serious here!!"`
`"...So am I.`
` ...I'm also being completely serious right now.`
` Please answer me.`
` ...If it were true, what wouldn't you leave alone?"`
`Sensei... took a few breaths... then began to speak slowly.`
`"F-First.`
` I'd have to visit Houjou-san's house to confirm the situation."`
`"Her uncle might get mad and drive you away, though.`
` ...Well, okay.`
` ...Let's say you did meet with Satoko and her uncle.`
` Then what?"`
`"Then I'd ask whether it was true.`
` Once I got the facts... I'd go from there."`
`"Please stop talking so vaguely.`
` What exactly would you do?"`
`...Even despite my tone being so provocative, Chie-sensei bit back her emotions and listened calmly.`
`......I thought then that she was a good teacher.`
`...Chie-sensei really did... have her students' best interests at heart.`
`...But... she didn't have the power or the authority to save Satoko.`
`If she let her sense of justice run away with her...`
` the situation could get more complex.`
`...Sensei folded her arms... and for a few moments, she closed her eyes as though mentally concentrating.`
`...And when they opened again... there was a strictness in her eyes I'd never seen before.`
`"There's a law called the Child Welfare Law.`
` It clearly states that abuse against children will not be allowed, no matter who it is."`
`"So it would seem.`
` ...Then what?"`
`"How many days would it take after you contact the social worker and submit the paperwork for her to be saved?"`
`"It would be the same day.`
` Their job is to guarantee the immediate safety of children."`
`"I know that.`
` That's if they decide there's an urgent need.`
` ...If they didn't... then they'd do the same as you.`
` They'd go from there—they'd just wait and see, right?`
`They'd just watch.`
` It would make Satoko's uncle's mood sour, and Satoko would be stuck with him there."`
`"......Kei-chan... that's going a little too far..."`
`"I'm not lying, am I?`
` Last year, or the year before, whatever—that's exactly what happened when the child welfare people came, isn't it?`
` And what happened then? `
`...You and Sensei would know about it a lot better than I would!"`
`...I had said too much—I didn't need Mion to tell me that.`
`...I was talking crazy and itching for a fight.`
`...I was supposed to be telling her about the situation only after I was sure we could save Satoko, but I basically told her everything right from the start.`
`Chie-sensei looked at the clock, stood up, and picked up the phone at the principal's seat.`
`"............Hello?`
` Put me through to extension 3455, please."`
`"...Is this okay, Kei-chan?`
` ...Is this... really okay...?"`
`It was too late.`
` ...The die had been cast.`
`...Now we could only... pray.`
`"Oh, thank you for answering my call.`
` I'm Chie, a licensed teacher at the Hinamizawa branch school—would Director Watanabe happen to be in the guidance office?`
` ...Yes, that's right. `
`...Something urgent came up, so I'd like to contact the principal as soon as I can.`
` ......Yes.`
` Thank you.`
` Please tell him immediately.`
` Yes, thank you..."`
`The teacher put down the phone...`
` and tilted her head back and took a breath, like I always did.`
`"...I'll ask the two of you again.`
` ...Are the rumors going around class really true?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ...Yesterday I went to Satoko's house... and I saw for myself just how bad it really is."`
`"You can leave the rest to me.`
` I'll definitely do something for Satoko-chan."`
`"...Something?`
` Please stop saying such ambiguous things.`
` Not something—we have to save her!!`
` If they end up deciding to wait and see again... how do you plan on taking responsibility!?"`
`While I was yelling, the phone rang.`
`Chie-sensei snatched the receiver up first.`
`"...Hello!`
` Oh... I apologize for interrupting your training.`
` ......Yes.`
` Actually, it's about the issue with Satoko Houjou-san.`
` ...Yes."`
`Sensei waved us away, telling us we could leave now.`
`...Mion went to leave, but I held my ground.`
`...I had a responsibility to make sure she stopped saying such vague, ambiguous things. `
`...If it didn't look like she was going to say anything substantial... then I'd tell them the truth, even if I had to steal the phone from her.`
`"......Yes.`
` .........No, I haven't contacted them yet.`
` ......Yes.`
` ...I haven't confirmed it... but it seems pretty bad from what the children are saying."`
`"It's not just pretty bad!!`
` Do something about it!!`
` Right now!!`
` If you're going to report it, then I don't care who you tell!!`
` But I swear, if they end up just waiting and watching...`
` I will never forgive you!!!"`
`I yelled angrily at Sensei and the principal on the other end.`
`...I wanted to somehow, some way... convey to them just how dangerous her situation was right now.`
`"I understand that!`
` I will tell them as much!`
` Mion-kun, please take Maebara-kun back to the classroom."`
`"Ah... yes, ma'am.`
` ...Let's go, Kei-chan.`
` We should leave this to the teachers now."`
`".........You better... promise..."`
`Until the very last moment... I glared at Sensei.`
`...Chie-sensei... was feeling pressured by the likes of me.`
` ...Idiot, this isn't the time to feel pressured.`
` ...Now's the time when you give me a firm nod to reassure me...!`
`Even so... we've already left things in her hands.`
`...At this point... we really can't do anything but pray.`
`Bang.`
` ...Mion shut the door to the teacher's lounge.`
