`"This Maebara-kun kid... Will he really be able to save us...?`
` We're up against the ace of Ooshimaâ€”left-arm Kameda-kun!`
` To be able to beat a Koshien-class pitcher... He must be a god...!"`
` Don't you know about Left-Arm Kameda-kun, the ace of Ooshima?"`
`"And Kameda-kun from Ooshima just happened to show up to watch the game today."`
`Ooshima was apparently a fairly well-known school in our prefecture that frequently sent people to Koshien.`
` I'm nothing but a... a pervert, pretending to be a proper sportsman..."`
`"That's right.`
` You're a pervert!!!"`
`"Do not cry, Kameda!!`
` What's wrong with a man being a pervert?!?!"`
`"A man ought to be a pervert!!`
` But admitting it sets a man apart from those below him!!`
` I'll go to Angel Mort on the way home and make a shortcake into my plaything all I want... hu-hu-hu!!`
`I draw ever closer to the trembling maidens, and then, one by one... I show them... hu-hu-hu!!!`
` For every one I eat... I hold my jaw tight, just like this, and appraise the goods... wondering which to eat next...`
`"...As if I'm showing off...!!`
` why don't I head down to Angel Mort and get all-you-can eat of gothic lolitas, decorated like western dolls in frills and ribbons?!`
`"L-Lolitas...`
` A-`
` All you can eat!!!"`
