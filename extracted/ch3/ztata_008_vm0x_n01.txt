` ...If Satoko's that important, then there wouldn't be any reason to torment her, would there...?"`
`He only even came back because the lady he was depending on vanished and he couldn't look after himself.`
`"......How's... the situation...?"`
` We'd need a lot of circumstantial evidence, but it's a problem, right?`

` ...This means... we have to just sit quietly and wait, don't we?"`
` ...Don't kids with no guardians... have to go to some sort of institution...?"`
` That's why Rika-chan is allowed to live separately from her guardian.`
`The one who brought an end to those terrible days... was some crazy drug addict nobody knew.`
`Before I could help it, I'd gently clasped Satoko's hand.`
`...And then, I noticed how hot it was...`

`"......I just can't seem to shake this year's summer cold.`
` Please, pay it no mind."`
`"...Satoko-chan probably... thinks of this poor treatment as a trial."`

` ......The young girl abandoned by her brother... How did she find her reason to live? `
`"...If... If I feel that Satoko is really in danger... I will take action without asking anyone's opinion. `
