`The autopsy suggests the victim was killed in the following manner.`
`1. Entire body bound in restraints`
`Traces left behind from when the body seemed to have been bound indicated usage of a specific restraining table rather than rope or another common method.`
`Finger joints on either hand appear to have been bound especially tightly.`
`Highly likely that the table was either specially-made or homemade given this information.`
`2. Both ears and nose severed with a sharp blade`
`Traces of the restraint and other things seem to suggest there was at least one more other than the one who severed these body parts holding down the victim's head.`
`Possible that multiple blades were used, with one of them most likely being scissors or shears.`
`3. Five nails penetrated fingers on each hand`
`One long nail stuck in each joint of each finger on each hand, for a total of thirty.`
`The deceased's fingers were nailed to wooden planks twenty square centimeters large; extremely likely these planks were part of the restraining table.`
`In addition, it is likely that the table was originally designed for just such a purpose.`
`4. Abdomen incised, intestines removed`
`The incision in the abdomen is likely to have been a technique grounded in medical methodology using a sharp blade.`
`Estimated that there was still no threat to the victim's life at this stage.`
`After this, the organs inside the incision were dismantled and removed. The victim likely died as a result of this process.`
`5. Body disposed`
`After fastening a dumbbell to the victim's neck using a commercial pet collar, the victim was likely abandoned in the Ouji River's third drain.`
`Judging by the dumbbell's weight, it's highly possible they would have needed at least three grown men to have disposed of the body.`

`Here's a copy of the preliminary autopsy of the slaughtered corpse in the Ouji River.`
`Chief Shigeharu sees this as having a possible relation to the S-group.`
` What are your thoughts, Ooishi-san?`
