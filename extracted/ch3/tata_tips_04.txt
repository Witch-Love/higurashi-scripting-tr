`"Shion-san, why don't you help out a little?"`
`"Are you asking a girl to carry something heavy?`
` This is why you still haven't found a nice lady at your age, Coach."`
`"Well, you see, at times like these, here's what people say.`
` Ahem—it's none of your business."`
`"Ahahahahahahaha."`
`He was loading the station wagon with heaps of equipment we'd used for today's barbecue meeting.`
`All the fathers and sons who had helped were starting to get on their way.`
`"...All right.`
` So, Shion-san...`
` Why did you come all the way here?`
` If you rode here on your bike, I can give you a lift."`
`"I did, but I'll be fine riding back.`
` I appreciate your consideration."`
`"......I was glad you came today.`
` Things don't quite fit together without the manager here."`
`"Am I still the manager?`
` I've been shirking my duty for an entire year, so maybe you should just fire such an incompetent manager already."`
`"All right.`
` If you say you want to quit, then I'll fire you whenever you want."`
`"...Grr.`
` That's not fair.`
` .........Let me go soon, please?`
` Every time I don't show up at a game, I get an annoying phone call, and I can't stand those."`
`"If you were more honest with yourself, Shion-chan, you'd be far cuter.`
` Your father is so sad—where did he go so wrong as to deserve such a rebellious daughter? `
`Oh, perhaps if your father catches you in a big, loving embrace, you'll open your eyes?!`
` Well then, don't mind if I do!!`
` Come here~~~♪♪♪"`
`...Coach was fooling around with all his might, but Shion just smiled into the distance without responding.`
`"......Nothing's changed.`
` You're still a weirdo, Coach, and everyone's still lively as ever."`
`"...Even though Satoshi-kun isn't here.`
` ...Is that what you wanted to say?"`
`"............"`
`"He'll come home.`
` I'm sure of it.`
` He has someone waiting for him."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...Say whatever you want."`
`"He sure is cruel, isn't he?`
` Going off to who knows where, leaving such a cute girlfriend behind."`
`"Heh?!`
` G-G-Girlfriend?!`
` Who?!`
` Who?!`
` ...Huh?!"`
`"Pfft... hu hu hu, ha ha ha ha ha ha!"`
`"...Pff... geez!`
` Quit laughing already!!`
` Coooach!!"`
`"Ha ha ha!`
` Wahh ha ha ha!!"`
`Coach bent over and laughed heartily for a little while...`
`"We'll see each other again.`
` Please come and root for us once in a while, okay?"`
`"If I feel like it.`
` ...I have no desire to be the manager anymore, after all."`
`"...That's fine.`
` If you don't like it, I'll fire you.`
` I'm not the kind of person who likes forcing people to do things against their will."`
`"..................Grr.`
` Okay, fine, fine!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry!`
` You win this round.`
` If I feel like it I'll come root for you, so for today, just be patient."`
`"Hu hu hu!`
` Whoops, that time already?`
` It's past time to return all this...!`
` I'm already making them wait for me!`
` I'll be leaving for today, then!`
` Let's meet again at the next game!"`
`"Yes, if I feel like it.`
` Good-bye, Coach."`
