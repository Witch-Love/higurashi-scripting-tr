`The sanctity of the ritual storehouse is one of the most prominent elements in the worship of Oyashiro-sama.`
`Of course, I knew that, since I'm originally from Hinamizawa.`
`But violating that sanctity is actually a more serious problem than I thought.`
`Takano-san's research shows that the history of the ritual storehouse goes way back.`
`The ritual implements within have long been viewed as inviolable objects, which is why it was strictly forbidden to enter.`
`Takano-san's theory says that Watanagashi was once a public execution, performed to stabilize the reign of the Three Families, rather than a purely religious ritual.`
`If so, the ritual should hardly be called sacred.`
`Under those circumstances, the implements should have been despised as symbols of hatred and fear.`
`When instruments of fear are too visible, it only creates a reign of terror.`
` But keep them as hidden as possible, and they gain divinity.`
`Many said they would become tainted if the laymen touched them.`
`The only reason for that was to preserve their false prestige through secrecy, since they would lose their sanctity if revealed before the common folk.`
`In other words, the true identity of the ritual storehouse's sacredness... was fear.`
` That was the true emotion ruling over this village...`
