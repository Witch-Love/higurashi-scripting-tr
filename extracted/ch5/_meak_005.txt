`The life I lived really was beginning to suffocate me.`
`I couldn't go out freely, and I always had to make arrangements with Mion before going to work.`
`I'd thought my life would improve after escaping from the school, but in reality, it wasn't that easy.`
`It's not healthy to live like this for too long.`
`Without any friends to hang out with,`
` I felt like I was hibernating.`
`I'd started to feel the dangers of falling into boredom.`
`All I could think of now was Satoshi Houjou-kun's face.`
`I'd only met him briefly.`
`...But my encounter with him had a great impact on my new life.`
`I felt like something exciting was going to happen. `
`...Really, I was hyped up like a little kid.`
`The more I thought about it, I realized I'd been thinking about him a lot lately.`
`...This might be a crush.`
`I felt a little ridiculous idolizing him in such a romantic way, though.`
`Then, out of the blue,`
` I got a chance to see him again.`
`".........Oh?"`
`I saw a familiar face at twilight in the park. He was sitting on the swing.`
`He looked like he was zoning out, or maybe deep in thought.`
`...He didn't notice me, even though I was right in front of him.`
`I reminded myself to speak and act like Mion before talking to him...`
`"Hey.`
` What are you doing here?"`
`".........Mion...`
` You surprised me."`
`"You don't look surprised.`
` I've been standing here for a couple of minutes now. Didn't you notice me?"`
`"...Have you?`
` Sorry, I didn't..."`
`He smiled self-derisively and shrugged.`
`He looked depressed.`
` Like something was troubling him.`
`"...Is something bugging you?`
` You can talk to me if you want. Maybe I can help."`
`"N-No... that's okay..."`
`"Come on, I owe you one from before, Satoshi-kun.`
` Or maybe,`
` you don't think this ol' man can be of any help?`
` Don't you know how mighty I am?"`
`"I'm okay...`
` You don't have to help me."`
`"......Huh.`
` What is it, then?`
` Are you saying that you don't need help from a girl?"`
`Thinking him unfair, I puffed up my cheeks in a sulky gesture.`
`...Satoshi-kun noticed that and smiled.`
`"No, Mion...`
` It's just... I messed up my swing when they needed me the most..."`
`...I mentally rifled through all the information about Satoshi-kun that Sis had given me.`
`...He doesn't look like much of an athlete, but apparently Satoshi-kun belongs to a junior baseball team.`
`They're called the Hinamizawa Fighters.`
`I doubt he's very skilled, since I didn't hear much about his contributions to the team.`
` Maybe that's why he doesn't tell many people that he's a member.`
`Given how down he felt as a result of messing up, though, he must be fairly dedicated. `
`I deduced all that from what Sis told me, and carefully chose my words so as to sound like her...`
`"What?`
` Are you feeling down just because of that?"`
`"Hey,`
` it's not that easy to get over, Mion."`
`I pat his back while chuckling.`
`Satoshi-kun would probably call me insensitive.`
`I knew I should listen to him, rather than trying to cheer him up.`
`Acting like Sis was probably the wrong thing to do in this case... but I had no choice.`
` This was just how she'd react in this situation.`
`"Aha ha ha.`
` Instead of feeling down, you should practice even harder and aim for your chance, you know?`
` Practice makes perfect here! `
`Well, if you want to beat the opposing pitcher so badly you're willing to pull some tricks, then I might be able to help you in a few ways."`
`"Mmph... there's no point if I cheat...`
` Hahhh..."`
`Satoshi-kun hung his head after letting his regrets out with a big sigh.`
`Surrender, defeat, resignation...`
` ...were all visible in that gesture of his.`
`"Are you quick to give up, or persistent?`
` If you're a man, then don't you want to be a star and have your fifteen minutes of fame?"`
`Satoshi-kun grinned and said "yes."`
`"Of course, that'd be wonderful,`
` but that's not why I play baseball.`
`I just have fun batting and throwing the ball...`
` You can understand that, right?"`
`"This ol' man isn't sure.`
` I only love games that I can win.`
` I don't understand how you can love something when you can't be the best at it.`
` Ahahaha!"`
`"Mmph...`
`Ahahahahahahaha. That really sounds like you, Mion!"`
`Having realized that I'm trying to make him feel better, he laughed along...`
` He didn't look depressed anymore.`
`I guess he was just feeling down because of the game.`
`He wasn't as depressed as I thought.`
`Maybe I just jumped to conclusions when I saw him sitting alone in the park.`
`"...You always put forth your best effort to win.`
` That's admirable, I think.`
` Yeah, it definitely is."`
`He smiled gently and stood up... then he started stroking my head.`
` All of a sudden.`
` I totally wasn't prepared for that.`
`"Eh?`
` ...Whoa... ooh..."`
`I thought this when he did this last time, but...`
`...How can he stroke somebody's head so easily...?`
`I felt like I had turned into a little kid.`
` Memories from kindergarten came to mind...`
` My face must have been red. I felt embarrassed... but also like I was in heaven.`
`Satoshi-kun stroked me as though petting a cat.`
`I was blushing with my eyes closed...`
`I felt helpless, like a girl being treated by the dentist with her mouth open and her eyes shut.`
`...Satoshi-kun didn't seem to notice my feelings at all.`
`...He didn't seem to care. I hate him.`
`With my eyes still closed, I waited for him to finish.`
` He suddenly withdrew his hand.`
`"...I need to get going.`
` My aunt wants some stuff, so I have to go grocery shopping."`
`"Uh... okay."`
`My voice faltered.`
` I was so embarrassed...`
`"Hmm?"`
`"Uh, um...!`
` ...I'm going shopping,`
` too..."`
`"Hmm?`
` What?`
` You are?`
` I thought the maids did all your household stuff."`
`Shoot...`
` I messed up.`
`In the main Sonozaki house, the maids do everything.`
`Therefore, Mion hardly goes grocery shopping, and she's bragged to some people about that...`
` I should've known better.`
`Still, it wouldn't be too hard to find an excuse.`
`"I just happened to be in town,`
` so I thought I'd help out with the household stuff.`
` Is that a problem?"`
`"...Ahaha.`
` That doesn't sound like you.`
` You always avoid doing boring stuff like that."`
`"You talk too much!`
` ...Ooh!`
` Stop stroking my head!"`
`"Ahaha, ahaha."`
`Satoshi-kun seemed to be having fun with how embarrassed I'd get when he patted me.`
`Anyway, I managed to talk my way out of it.`
` He didn't seem to really care about the details...`
`While walking with Satoshi-kun in the shopping district of Kami-isshiki... it suddenly occurred to me.`
`Why had I messed up?`
`I'd known Mion would never go grocery shopping... What an amateurish mistake.`
`...Did I make that mistake when I was pretending to be Mion?`
`No...`
` I was probably speaking as Shion.`
`I couldn't keep lying to myself...`
` I had to just admit...`
`It was simply because,`
` I wanted to spend as much time with Satoshi-kun as possible...`
`It was easy to see why I was so attracted to him.`
`I'd found something intriguing in my boring life,`
`and I didn't have to feel tense, because he thought I was somebody else.`
` Et cetera, et cetera.`
` His easygoing nature made him fun to be around, and... his habit of petting people on the head was fun too.`
`From these symptoms...... I could tell I was embracing the feeling of love.`
`I was just casually enjoying that feeling.`
`It wasn't that I fell in love with him.`
`I was just having fun.`
`I could simply spend some fun time with Satoshi-kun without having to think too much.`
`"Uhh...`
` Which one is broccoli?`
` The green one`
` or the yellow one?"`
`"That's cauliflower, Satoshi-kun...`
` Hey, could it be that you can't tell lettuce from cabbage, either?"`
`"I-I'm not that bad...`
` I'm doing my best here..."`
`Satoshi-kun stared at the heaps of broccoli and cauliflower.`
`After thinking for a while, he reached out for the wrong one...`
`"That's not it!`
` ...Watching you shop is like being on a roller coaster.`
` It's a lot of fun for me, though!`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"...Mmph.`
` You got me.`
` Satoko can't tell the difference either.`
` Which is broccoli and which one is cauliflower...?"`
`"...You guys are too funny."`
`Sis had told me that Satoshi was a flaky big brother to his nagging little sister.`
`I hadn't met Satoko, but she must be having a tough time dealing with Satoshi-kun.`
`He stumbles over everything he buys, after all.`
`"That's cooking salt.`
` ...It's mixed with pepper. It's different from regular salt."`
`"Oh... is it?`
` I think I saw salt and pepper separate in a science experiment once..."`
`"Stop making excuses and just put it back on the shelf...`
` This is normal salt!`
` What are you getting next?"`
`"Uh...... Ahahahaha. You're being a great help, Mion..."`
`"...You look smart, but you have serious issues...`
` I think you should study more..."`
`"Mmph....`
` That's a little harsh...`
` ...There.`
` Is this it?`
` In it goes."`
`"Ahh!`
` That's not it!`
` Don't just throw anything in the basket; check the price and how many servings it is first!"`
`My first impression of Satoshi-kun was that... he was strong and reliable.`
`But the more I spoke to him, the more surprised I was at how clumsy and unreliable he was.`
`How do I put it... It was hard to leave him alone.`
` He was dangerous on his own.`
`If he wasn't careful he might start wondering, "Do you cross the street when the light is red?`
` Or was it green?"`
` ...And get himself run over by a dumptruck... (Sweatdrop)`
`"Your total is 1,780 yen.`
` Do you have a member's card?"`
`"Huh? ...Oh, yes.`
` I do...`
` ...Uhh... ......Huh? Where is it?"`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` We can't seem to find it, so we'll be alright for today."`
`I finished checking out, ignoring Satoshi-kun as he fished through his wallet full of receipts.`
`"That was horrible, Mion...`
` You made me waste points..."`
`"Don't go slowly fishing through your wallet to look for your member's card in the middle of the evening shopping rush!`
` There was a huge line behind us! `
`Didn't you notice all the evil glares from all the old ladies?!`
` Listen, at times like that, you should get it out before reaching the register!"`
`"...Oh. ...Right.`
` Ahaha, that's good to know."`
`"It's not only when you go shopping.`
` The same thing goes for when you ride a bus! `
`Satoshi-kun, I bet you don't open your wallet and start looking for change until you're about to get off and have to pay while holding up everyone behind you."`
`"...Mmph....`
` No, everyone walks by me and pays their own fare..."`
`"Hah...`
` You know what that means?`
` You're being a super-huge bother to everyone!`
` You need to have the money out beforehand. That's just good manners!`
` Do you get it?!"`
`"O-Okay...`
` You're scary today, Mion... Ahahaha..."`
`Satoshi-kun smiled as if patronizing me.`
`...Hah... I couldn't believe it.`
`...He was definitely the type who made women want to protect him.`
`...Sure, he was fine as he was when he had a busybody like me around him,`
` but I couldn't stop worrying whether he was able to function in society without someone like that nearby.`
`We got plastic bags and sorted out what we bought.`
`...Satoshi-kun put a pack of tofu at the bottom of the bag. I slapped his hand and put in a milk carton instead.`
`"Okay, there we go.`
` Now your aunt won't freak out when she opens this shopping bag in her kitchen."`
`"Uh... thanks.`
` You helped me a lot...`
` I don't think I'm very good at shopping."`
`"Just shopping?`
` That's definitely not the only thing!"`
`"......Mm... mmph......"`
`"Ahahahahahaha!`
` Just kidding."`
`I had realized a few things while I was spending time with him today.`
`...He's not just bad at shopping.`
` He's also chronically clumsy.`
`...In general, you could call him a slow thinker.`
`...That meant... when he stepped into the quarrel with the punks, he must have needed a lot of courage.`
`He might be a simpleton, but he's not stupid.`
`He's aware of his weaknesses.`
`...So, he must have been aware of the danger in that situation.`
`...He could have chosen to walk away even though I was in trouble.`
`But he chose to be a man and stepped in.`
` That was really admirable of him.`
`"Good boy.`
` You did a great job.`
` There, there."`
`"Wh-What is it?`
` Don't stroke my head."`
`"I'm rewarding you for shopping successfully today.`
` There, there."`
`"You're making fun of me, aren't you, Mion?"`
`"No, I'm not.`
` Can you go home by yourself?`
` Do you know how to get there?"`
`"Mmph...`
` You <i>are</i> making fun of me..."`
`Satoshi-kun's sulky face flushed red....`
` Ahh, he's just too cute.`
`At that point, I caught a glimpse of a billboard from the corner of my eye.`
`'Piano Lessons. Call XX.`
` Abacus Class......`
` Junior Baseball Team--Members Wanted.'`
`It was a posting for the team Satoshi-kun belonged to.`
`It showed the day, time, and place of their next practice.`
`By then, I knew just how flaky he was.`
`I figured he must be just the same when playing baseball.`
`Satoshi-kun realized that I was reading the posting. He looked uncomfortable and walked away.`
`"I know what you're thinking...`
` 'I beg you Mion,`
` don't come to see me playing baseball.'`
` ...Am I right?!"`
`"M-Mmph.........`
` Ahh......... mmph."`
`"What does that mumbling mean?`
` ......I know I'm right."`
`"......Mmph......"`
`Satoshi-kun became quiet`
` after mumbling something.`
`...It seemed like he couldn't say anything back, since I had been right on the money.`
`...Satoshi-kun... You're just too cute.`
`...I don't think going silent is a good way to dodge the issue...`
` Well, that might have just been the way innocent people like him would react in a situation like that.`
`"See you, Satoshi-kun.`
` It's getting dark, so be careful on your way back!"`
`"Aren't you going home, Mion?`
` To Hinamizawa?"`
`"...Uh... I have to make a stop somewhere first.`
` Don't worry about me."`
`"I'll help you this time.`
` In return."`
`"Uh, ahahahahaha.`
` I'm okay!`
` What are you going to help me with, anyway?`
` You should learn to support yourself before you try to help me.`
` Ahhhahahahaha!"`
`"...Mmph...`
` You're really mean today..."`
`He seemed to have some pride, at least.`
`He looked a bit upset because he was teased by a girl...`
` but in contrast, I felt very satisfied.`
`As a result, I forgot to keep my guard up.`
`"Uh, thank you for the help.`
`That was sweet of you."`
`"Whoa...!`
` ...Mmm..."`
`While wearing a bright smile...`
` Satoshi-kun suddenly started stroking my head again.`
`Ahh... I know he's teasing me, but...`
` ooh, I can't reject him...`
` mmm...`
`He keeps doing it only because he's realized I won't resist...`
` ooohhh...`
`"See you, Mion!`
` You should go home before it gets dark...`
` See you in school tomorrow."`
`"Uh, yeah!`
` See you in school tomorrow too!"`
`In fact, I wouldn't see him tomorrow at all.`
`...It felt awkward, but I had to settle for that.`
` I had to thank Sis for letting me use her name.`
`After I separated from him....`
`...I found myself giddy and wishing to see him again as soon as possible.`
`I wanted to know more about him.`
`I couldn't wait for my next chance to see him.`
`...Actually, maybe there was something I could do.`
`Just like when I obtained my freedom from St. Lucia's,`
` I could choose how to live my life.`
`...Whatever. It wasn't that complicated.`
`I just wanted to tease him more. I wanted him to stroke my head more,`
` and...... ahh, whatever.`
`I already knew the schedule for his baseball team.`
