`"Hey there!!`
` How are you guys doing in the heat?!"`
`"Oh, Mion-san.`
` We're doing good.`
` Is that our refreshment?`
` Thanks a bunch.`
` You're such a great manager!"`
`"I just felt like coming here.`
` I didn't bring this for you, by the way.`
` And don't treat me as your manager without my permission, please."`
`"We'd be a stronger team if you were our manager, Mion.`
` ...Why don't you apply?`
` As manager, I mean."`
`Satoshi-kun smiled at me in a carefree manner.`
`...I didn't want to become their manager. It'd be tiresome.`
`I've been coming every week, though, so I'm a quasi-manager already.`
`"Well, if I feel like it.`
` Anyway, how's Satoshi-kun doing, Coach?`
` Is his batting average improving?"`
`"Yes, yes. He's doing fine.`
` His batting average is...... well,`
` if you buy three packs of rice crackers at Sevens Mart..."`
`"Aha hahaha!`
` Does that mean it's thirty percent?`
` ...Wow,`
` you're doing great, Satoshi-kun!"`
`"...Mmph.`
` It's not just about the number, Mion.`
` I have to be able to hit the ball when it really counts."`
`"It's good that you're aware of your weaknesses, Satoshi-kun.`
` You just continue working on them for now."`
`Irie signaled to the pitcher, who then threw the ball.`
`Satoshi-kun looked calm, following the ball with his eyes. Then he swung!`
`Thwack!!`
`The ball flew between the first and second bases and landed in the distance.`
`"Wow!`
` That's great!`
` Good job, Satoshi-kun!"`
`I clapped, and Satoshi-kun blushed in response. He repositioned his helmet to hide his face.`
`"Well,`
` he's good in practice and when the game is slow..."`
`Irie smiled compassionately.`
`...It seemed that Satoshi-kun really couldn't perform well when it counted.`
`While he was usually good, when everybody expected him to perform, he couldn't.`
`I didn't think it was because of nervousness... he just couldn't do it.`
`...I think it's a perfect fit for Satoshi-kun's character. He seems calm at first glance, but he's actually slow.`
`"Numerically speaking, you're a great player...`
` But you need to be able to hit the ball even when things get serious.`
` That's why you were an easy out in the match with the Ukita Jaguars the other day!!"`
`"......Mmph...`
` Shut up. I know that."`
`"If he'd been able to hit the ball then, he would have been a hero...`
` What a shame..."`
`A hit could have put the offense into the lead, or at least given them an extension.`
` That was when Satoshi-kun came up to bat.`
`Irie wanted him to live up to everybody's expectations...`
`But statistically, that wasn't likely to happen...`
`Yet Irie insisted on giving him a chance, in spite of the fact that all the team members had suggested a pinch hitter.`
`"Ahh!`
` It would've been perfect if you could have hit it!!`
` Why didn't you?!`
` Why can't you hit the ball in a situation when it really matters?!"`
`"There was nothing I could do...`
` I know I'm weak in a situation like that...`
` I thought a pinch hitter was a better idea too..."`
`"It's not about the match, it's about you, Satoshi-kun!!`
` Arrgh!!`
` You need to be more aggressive!!`
` Shouldn't you have thought the opposite way? `
`Shouldn't you have insisted that you'd come up to bat, no matter what everybody else said?!`
` I can't believe you wanted to give away the chance to some pinch hitter!!`
` Why are you so weak like that...?!"`
`"That's what I'm always telling him...`
` I know that's one of his good points, too. But, uh......"`
`"You can be a gentleman at other times, but when playing games, you should be a demon!!`
` I think all men should have those two sides to them!!`
` You need to let your demon out, Satoshi-kun!! `
`You're native to Hinamizawa, so never forget that you have the demon's blood running through your veins!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` Satoshi-kun?!"`
`"...Mmph...`
` I-I am...`
`I'm not sure, but..."`
`"What aren't you sure about? We're talking about you!`
` So...`
` ...Whoa!`
` .........Ahh..."`
`Satoshi-kun suddenly started stroking my head. He looked delighted, for some reason.`
`...A blush immediately spread across my face.`
` I didn't know how to respond...`
`"You're giving me advice, right?`
` Thanks.`
` I'll do my best."`
`"......H-Hey...`
` don't you try to fool me..."`
`"I'm not.`
` I'm just happy that you care about me.`
` Ahahahaha."`
`I couldn't resist his hand.`
`...I couldn't help mumbling like he does.`
`Satoshi-kun ran back to the field, leaving me red as a beet.`
`"...Do you feel good when you have your head stroked?"`
`"...Depends.`
` If it were you, I'd have to teach you a new martial arts technique."`
`"Ah, what a shame!`
` Aha ha ha ha...`
` All right, everyone, gather around!!`
` Why don't you split into groups and have a practice match?"`
`The Hinamizawa Fighters are sort of a lazy team.`
`The members gather simply to enjoy playing baseball, not to fight for victory.`
`The Okinomiya Titans use this field too, but they practice on a different day of the week. They always train hard using dumbbells and stuff.`
`Our team split into two groups and started a match, retaining their loose atmosphere.`
`"I'll keep track of the score.`
` Coach, do you have a pencil?"`
`"Thanks for helping out.`
` Here."`
`I took the pencil and the clipboard.`
`...I didn't know how to differentiate between recording hits and errors at first, but by now I was used to it.`
`"Show me what you got, Satoshi-kun!!`
` Oh, maybe it'll be too much pressure if I cheer for you too excessively.`
` Just do okay then!"`
`"...Mmph... That doesn't sound very encouraging either...!"`
`"Ahahahaha! Do your best!!"`
`Time passed slowly that Sunday.`
`Huge white clouds appeared in the sky. They made me feel healthy.`
`Humans are born to be active under the sun.`
`One of the parents was acting as umpire today,`
` so Irie sat on the bench with me.`
`He shouted words of encouragement to the kids while they ran to their positions.`
`Any other baseball coach would constantly berate them, but he was much more generous, like a kindergarten teacher.`
`He let the kids have fun while watching over them.`
`...To other baseball players, it might look a little naive...`
`"I'm surprised you guys can do well with only a small amount of practice."`
`"Kids in Hinamizawa romp around every day,`
` so the amount of exercise they get surpasses that of the city kids.`
` Besides, too much training is not always effective."`
`"...Wow, you think completely differently from the Okinomiya Titans.`
` I can understand why their coach hates you."`
`"It's not about being right.`
` Matches exist for someone to win, after all.`
` So prioritizing victory certainly isn't wrong.`
`I think it's admirable to aim for victory together... `
`but the goal of our team doesn't happen to be victory, that's all."`
`The Hinamizawa Fighters and the Okinomiya Titans had been rivals for a long time.`
`Both teams shared the same baseball field, for one thing...`
` and originally, there was only one team, but the people living in Hinamizawa left and made their own...`
`Anyhow,`
` we were rivals.`
`The Okinomiya Titans were strictly about winning, and the Hinamizawa Fighters were just about having fun.`
`...Surprisingly, our scores weren't that different.`
`Which meant... our team had something they didn't.`
`Even though I couldn't put it into words, I knew what made that happen.`
`"Hey, Team One, no slacking!`
` You can make up the two-point difference pretty easily!`
` Team Two, no slacking either!"`
`Still, some parents would criticize our coach for being too lenient.`
`...But still others would strongly agree with him.`
` Which side would I take?`
` Hmm... the latter...? I couldn't really say for sure.`
`The reason for this was that Irie had an obnoxious habit of sexual harassment.`
`In particular, he had a fascination with maids... but I should talk about that some other time.`
`Satoshi-kun let the ball pass twice to see its trajectory, then hit it on the third pitch and ran to first base.`
`"Oh, he did it.`
` He's so good when he's relaxed."`
`"In the beginning he used to get tired very easily.`
` Hahahaha. He's improved quite a lot since then."`
`"......He really does look kind of like a bookworm.`
` I wonder why he started playing baseball in the first place..."`
`All the other kids who joined the baseball team loved baseball.`
`They'd go out to play in the fields outside of practice. That's why they all had an aptitude for it.`
`But Sis never said that Satoshi-kun exercises intensively in school or anywhere else.`
` He only likes to read.`
`That's why I didn't understand why he started playing for this team to begin with.`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` That's because I invited him."`
`"Is that so?`
` You recruited him?`
` ...Did you notice some sort of hidden talent?"`
`"Uh, excuse me. Can I have a cup of barley tea?`
` ......Ah, thank you."`
`Irie asked for tea in a suspicious manner.`
`...While he constantly joked around, I knew he was actually a very mature person.`
`I assumed he was trying to evade my question.`
`"...Is there a particular reason?"`
`Irie pretended he didn't hear me, but I pressed him on it. In response, he shrugged, and began answering the question.`
`"...I think you might be able to guess."`
`...What would be Mion Sonozaki's guess?`
`...I quickly searched through the data I had on Satoshi-kun...`
`I came up with Satoshi-kun's family circumstances.`
`He lost his parents in an accident a year ago.`
`Since then, he's been having a tough time at his uncle's home.`
`"...So, you invited him so that he could vent?"`
`"Sports are great.`
` You can free yourself through exercise.`
` I thought that as long as he concentrated on something else, he could forget about his troubles at home."`
`"...Er... you know he's usually sort of a daydreamer... zoning out all the time...`
` Is he still stressed...?"`
`I knew Satoshi-kun must be suffering even though he didn't look like it.`
`But Mion Sonozaki never pays attention to things like that, and I had to act like she does.`
`"Satoshi-kun got really sick after his uncle took him into his custody.`
` He had many clinical symptoms, but the causes were unknown."`
`Satoshi-kun often got sick`
` after he was taken into his uncle's custody.`
`He suffered from fatigue and migraines.`
`He suffered from a lack of energy and sleeplessness.`
`...The coach, I mean, Dr. Irie, soon realized:`
` Satoshi-kun was suffering from a psychological disorder.`
`Most of the people in Hinamizawa knew how bad Satoshi-kun's environment was.`
`It was natural for him to become sick, because he entered that bad environment right after his parents' deaths.`
`"Satoshi-kun cannot express himself freely.`
` Whether it's crying or simply being agitated, he's not good at handling those emotions."`
`"...That's true. I can't imagine him being angry or crying..."`
`"...Did you know Satoshi-kun's mother had been married a few times already?"`
`"...Yeah,`
` I know a little bit about that."`
`Satoshi-kun's mother had married a number of men over the years.`
`That meant Satoshi-kun had several stepfathers.`
`He had to deal with strangers coming into his home multiple times, so he was forced to be mature.`
`"Satoshi-kun is mentally underdeveloped.`
` He isn't aware of it himself, though...`
` He didn't have enough time to cry, laugh, and throw tantrums in his childhood... `
`He was forced to become a grownup in just a short time."`
`"......That doesn't sound right."`
`"Children have to behave like children in order to grow...`
` There's nothing positive about being forced to become an adult."`
`Not only was Satoko's current relationship with her aunt conspicuously terrible,`
` I heard that her relationships with her previous stepfathers weren't good either.`
`Satoko always caused problems...`
`And Satoshi-kun would always step in to protect her.`
`"......I thought his physical symptoms came from the stress. His body was trying to warn him."`
`That's why Irie invited Satoshi-kun onto the baseball team.`
`He told Satoshi`
` that he needed a new member...`
` or something like that.`
`"He hesitated at first...`
` but after I talked to him at the clinic a few times, he began to open up to me.`
` ...First I invited him to come see the practice...`
` then I suggested he try batting...`
` I eased him into it..."`
`Sports worked excellently for Satoshi-kun.`
`His health quickly improved, and he started to become interested in baseball.`
`He practiced batting. He was soon able to swing beautifully, and...`
` he learned how to see the trajectory of the ball.`
`"...Ah, I can imagine that.`
` He likes to read,`
` so he must have read a book titled 'How to Play Baseball' or something like that."`
`"He's become a good batter very quickly.`
` He's put forth a lot of effort...`
` Though I wish he could actually hit when it comes down to the wire too...`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Are you guys close?"`
`"I think so...`
` He talks to me about his problems, so I guess that's a sign of trust."`
`I felt a bit jealous of how confidently Irie said that.`
`While Satoshi-kun and I were friends, we weren't so close that we'd open up to each other like that...`
`"...Oh,`
` are you jealous?"`
`"Ehh?!`
` ...About what?!"`
`Taken aback, I blushed.`
`Irie started laughing at me.`
`"......Please stay as his good friend."`
`"W-Well, yeah... ahahahaha. I'm trying...`
` hahaha..."`
`I didn't know what I was saying.`
`"...You know, regarding Satoshi-kun...`
` He seems a little sick again lately."`
`"............What?"`
`Thwack!`
`The ball flew to the left.`
`...But the left fielder managed to catch it.`
`It seemed that the relationship between Satoko and her aunt had gotten worse lately.`
`...It was obvious his sickness had something to do with that.`
`"Their aunt is bullying Satoko-chan in a terrible way...`
` She's become worn out after all that,`
` and..."`
`"So,`
` Satoshi-kun is also worn out...`
` from covering for Satoko, isn't he?"`
`I wasn't interested in Satoko, so I switched the subject back to Satoshi-kun.`
`...I didn't know much about Satoko.`
`I knew that she was a big part of Satoshi-kun's life, but... I'd never been interested in her until today.`
`She must have been building up self-esteem in taking care of her unreliable brother.`
` That was all I knew about her.`
`......But, considering Satoshi-kun's personality, even that goofiness of his might have been an act.`
`Maybe he was trying to make her feel good about herself by letting her take care of him...`
` if only unconsciously.`
`When he's alone, he's surprisingly strong.`
`I realized that only recently...`
` So, I couldn't help but think...`
`...That his whole life is constantly affected by Satoko.`
`Satoshi-kun managed to get along with his stepfathers even though he experienced some stress.`
`He was even getting along with his aunt.`
`......But in order to protect Satoko... he always had to step in and suffer.`
`I didn't really know anything about Satoko, but......`
` I had to admit, I felt hostile toward her.`
`...I felt jealous because she was monopolizing him.`
`"It seems that their aunt has been tyrannizing Satoko-chan even more lately...`
` That must be what's causing Satoshi-kun's sickness."`
`Irie heaved a sigh.`
`As he said, Satoshi-kun had been absent a few times lately.`
`...He seemed a bit tired, too.`
`He looked normal when around everybody else, but he looked a bit depressed when he was alone.`
`"...So, you invited him to join the team to relieve his stress, didn't you?"`
`"Yes,`
` that's right."`
`"...But he looks stressed again now.`
` How can we save him this time?"`
`"..................Hahaha.`
` I don't know..."`
`Irie smiled powerlessly.`
`...I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed about that, because Satoshi-kun put his trust in him.`
`"Just between you and me......`
` Satoshi-kun recently told me`
` that he wanted to leave the team."`
`"Eh?`
` ...How come...?"`
`"He claimed he was tired of it...`
` That's what he said,`
` but I believe he actually wants to spend more time with Satoko-chan.`
`He thinks that Satoko-chan might end up being tortured while he's at practice.`
` I think he's concerned about that."`
`"....................."`
`I was left speechless for a while.`
`......Satoko again.`
` Satoko.`
`Why did Satoshi-kun have to sacrifice so much for her?`
`Just by ignoring her, his stress would melt away.`
`...Of course, I knew he couldn't do that.`
`If that were the case, then... the blame lay with his little sister.`
`I knew how badly she'd been treated.`
`But that only happened because she made things worse for herself.`
`It was her fault that she couldn't establish a decent relationship with their aunt.`
`If Satoko were more mature, like Satoshi-kun, her home life wouldn't have gotten so bad.`
`......Satoshi-kun wouldn't have to suffer those indirect blows.`
`In the meantime, the baseball team's practice match had become one-sided. It wasn't even worth watching anymore.`
`The members of the losing team were just goofing off.`
`The sky had turned cloudy too. It was depressing.`
`...It didn't look like it'd rain soon, though. The gray sky hadn't brought along any cool air. It just felt disgusting.`
`Irie became quiet. He was looking down around his feet.`
`I, meanwhile, just stared at Satoshi-kun.`
`......To me, he didn't look active anymore.`
`...He was once able to enjoy playing baseball, and he felt fine.`
`...But he got sick again... just because the relationship between Satoko and her aunt had deteriorated.`
`...I couldn't help but say it.`
`"...Shouldn't we do something about Satoko instead?"`
`It was just a murmur, but Irie had definitely caught it.`
`"...What...`
` ...do you mean, Sonozaki-san?"`
`"It's not that complicated...`
` If Satoko were stronger, Satoshi-kun wouldn't have to deal with stress.`
` I think Satoko is the cause of everything."`
`".........Nn......`
` I don't know about that..."`
`"Yes, you do.`
` If she didn't cause any trouble, he wouldn't have to step in, would he?`
` He wouldn't have to take over in the fight between Satoko and her aunt, right?"`
`Satoshi-kun never got scared of any trouble.`
`......No matter how formidable the enemy,`
` he'd bravely stand up`
` to protect the weak.`
` I knew that because I could vividly imagine it.`
`Whenever their aunt chides Satoko...`
`...Satoshi-kun steps in`
` to protect her.`
`...The aunt probably didn't like it.`
`...Though Satoshi-kun didn't have to fight, the aunt would attack him anyway. The fight would then be between the aunt and him.`
`Satoko might then tease the aunt by sticking out her tongue, hiding behind his back, and pretending to be scared.`
`...She'd never think about how deeply he was being hurt.`
`Because of Satoko... Satoshi-kun had become cornered and stressed.`
`"I'm surprised to hear this from you, Sonozaki-san...`
` I thought you were Satoko-chan's friend, her classmate,`
` a big sister kind of figure...`
` I thought you'd always be on her side.`
` ...But what you've said is... `
`surprising to me."`
`Irie looked at me suspiciously.`
`...I could tell what he was thinking about me.`
`...I'd said too much.`
`Mion Sonozaki and Satoko Houjou are friends.`
`They're close...... so, Mion should have been encouraging her, after the situation at home got tougher.`
` That's what`
` Mion was supposed to do.`
`I had totally forgotten about that, and spoken as myself.`
`.........It's only natural that Irie would give me a suspicious look.`
`...He might end up changing his impression of Mion Sonozaki entirely.`
`.........I'd have to apologize to her about this, and ask her to put things right.`
`..................I'd totally messed up.`
`Even so...... I didn't think I'd said anything wrong.`
`I'd objectively looked at the situation and made a modest proposal.`
`To be honest,`
` I was simply afraid that he might leave the team.`
`I couldn't go to the school in Hinamizawa,`
` so the baseball field was the only place where I could see him.`
`I could even say that he was my reason for living.`
`......That's right. I was in love with him.`
`...But I wasn't going to tell him how I felt...`
` For I was satisfied just being by his side.`
`I certainly couldn't ask for anything more.`
`...After all, I couldn't reveal my true identity.`
`I had to pretend to be Mion in order to live in Okinomiya.`
`I thought that maybe I should leave Okinomiya in order to be free...`
`...But that's stupid!`
`No matter how tough my life might be...`
` I'd prefer to be here`
` with Satoshi-kun stroking my head every now and then.`
`...Why did I love him that much...?`
`I read about it in some manga once.`
`You don't need a reason to be in love.`
`...I was surprised at myself for being like this.`
`"...Calm down...`
` Shion......"`
`I breathed out slowly, then held my breath......`
` trying to slow my throbbing heart.`
`I felt a bit calmer.`
`...At that point, a clear thought came into my head.`
`I want to be with Satoshi-kun.`
`So?`
`I want him to stay on the team.`
`So?`
`I want to get rid of his concerns and his stress.`
`So what?`
`......So`
` ...What can I do to achieve all that?`
`My head started to cool down... as I heard the umpire shout.`
`"Game set!`
` And match!!!!"`
