`June, 1982.`
`Satoshi Houjou disappeared several days after the Watanagashi festival.`
`There were three possible reasons for his disappearance.`
`One possibility is that it was an accident.`
`Dead bodies sometimes end up in irrigation channels a few months after hit-and-run incidents.`
`But since the police did a thorough search of the area and hadn't found his body, this possibility seems small.`
`The second possibility is a self-motivated disappearance.`
`Satoshi-kun has been living in dire circumstances.`
`His close friends actually heard him imply he might run away.`
`The police thought he skipped town after killing his aunt.`
`That seemed plausible, considering that aspect.`
`But the police arrested another person for the murder, so this hypothesis must also be considered false.`
`The last possibility is that he was involved in the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
`It's also called the curse of Oyashiro-sama.\nHe fell victim to it, and disappeared.`
`Unless Oyashiro-sama's occult power is actually verified, this curse must be the act of humans.`
`It's only natural to assume that Satoshi-kun was made to disappear by someone's will.`
`So, the question is, whose?`
`The possibilities are quite limited.`
`The culprit is either a member of the Sonozaki family, a member of the Three Families, or one of their many relatives.`
`......The police can assume that easily.`
`I need to think beyond that.`
`Who did it? How did it happen? And why did it have to be done?`
`Why did Satoshi-kun fall victim?`
`What was the motive?`
`Who gave out that order?`
`Who actually did it?`
`The mastermind, the culprit, and the truth...`
`All are in reach of my grasp.`
`Maybe I'll find them right behind my back.`
`But even so, I can't reach everywhere.`
`There are parts of my back I have to make an effort to reach, clenching my teeth and cracking my joints so that the tips of my fingers can barely touch them.`
`The truth is hidden in places like those.`
`I'm writing this because......`
`...I need to organize my thoughts and memories.`
`Nobody will read it other than myself.`
`But if somebody does...`
`...That means that either I threw these notes away because I no longer needed them,`
` or I fell victim to the curse of Oyashiro-sama in the middle of my attempt to solve the mystery.`
`If it was the former, that's okay.`
`...But if it was the latter...`
`Please.`
`I want you to help me.`
`Please help this powerless young girl.`
