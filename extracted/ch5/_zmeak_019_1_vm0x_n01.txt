`"But... I've been living in Okinomiya all my life!`
` Since the old woman hated me, I've barely been to Hinamizawa!`
` Besides, I was stuck at school.`
` How would I know about any of that?!"`
`"Hm?`
` ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.`
` And, well... it was a bit endless."`
`Endless.`
` The party quite literally continued to the following morning.`
`"D-Did you pull an all nighter?!`
` You worried me..."`
`"Shion?`
` I thought you'd be sleeping in today after the all-nighter, same as Mion."`
`"What?`
` My sis left early?`
` Ah hahahaha!`
` That's so like her~~!"`
