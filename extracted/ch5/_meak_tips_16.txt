`I wasn't planning to kill the hag so quickly.`
`I was going to kill her anyway, but it was too soon.`
`People would normally assume that the Sonozaki family operates as a hierarchy, but that's not true.`
`It's actually more like a system of government. Several ministries stem from the main family, and each forms a hierarchy of its own.`
`These ministries don't communicate with one another.`
`The people who belong to a given ministry don't know what other ministries are doing. That way, the Sonozaki family's dealings are kept perfectly secret.`
`Of course, the most important people in the family govern several ministries.`
`They know, of course, about their own ministries...`
`And they know a little bit about the ministries their relatives run.`
`But none of them know everything.`
`There are ministries that work in the open,`
` there are ministries that work unseen,`
` and there are some smaller ones that Oryou runs herself.`
`Mion seems to know about most of them, but she doesn't necessarily know them all.`
`In fact, she didn't know about 'the curse.'`
`Considering that, the fact that the hag died before I could interrogate her is a huge loss...`
