`The reason why Takano-san and Tomitake-san were cursed is because they broke into the ritual storehouse.`
`I don't know how the villagers found out about it.`
`Maybe somebody was watching.`
`Maybe there was an anti-theft alarm.`
`Either way, our intrusion must've been reported to the highest level of the curse system.`
`That's because, considering the distance between the village and the site where Takano-san's body was found,`
` she must've been killed right after we came out of the ritual storehouse.`
`It was done very quickly.`
`It's possible that a special assassination team exists for this purpose, or that the plan had been set up a long time ago.`
`They might've been secret agents of the Sonozaki family, but the latter sounds more valid.`
`But if so, who would have been the victim if nobody broke into the ritual storehouse?`
