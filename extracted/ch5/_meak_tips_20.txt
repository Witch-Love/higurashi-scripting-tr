`At this point, I believe that I can complete my revenge by destroying the curse system entirely.`
`That means that I have to eliminate the heads of all the Three Families,`
` the successor Shion,`
` and the assassins who are after Keiichi.`
`Although Keiichi is completely unguarded, he hasn't been attacked so far.`
`Even though I told everybody that he was one of the trespassers.`
`In fact, it's me who's being attacked. Rika Furude attacked me.`
`According to my theory, Keiichi should make for very attractive bait.`
`But nobody has done anything to harm him.`
` Since Rika Furude attacked me,`
` it might be that opposing the Furude family is a greater taboo than trespassing in the ritual storehouse.`
`Rika Furude had said that intrusion wasn't a big deal.`
`She sounded like she was going to let Keiichi walk.`
`And after I accused her of that, 'Rika Furude' attacked me that very night.`
`Are there two different factions?`
`Does one handle trespassers in the ritual storehouse,`
` while the other protects the religious doctrines of the Furude family?`
`No, that doesn't make sense.`
`Tomitake-san's death must have been caused by the Furude family's injections.`
`Rika showed me the effect of it herself, clawing out her own throat and dying like that.`
`But Tomitake-san shouldn't have been subject to the curse, at least according to the system of the Furude family.`
`I don't understand why Keiichi hasn't been attacked.`
`Did he have something exempting him from the curse, unlike Takano-san?`
`Just like how only Satoko Houjou was spared?`
`Keiichi is a friend of Rika Furude's.`
`So... does that mean that if you were close to her, you wouldn't be cursed?`
`Was she more important than the whole system?`
`That's impossible.`
`The hag was at the top of the curse system.`
` Rika couldn't have been higher up than her.`
`Scribble scribble.`
`Are there multiple ways to determine the subject of the curse?`
`Are there as many curse execution groups as there are subjects, and do they all work separately?`
`Ah, it's a mess.`
` None of my theories add up.`
`If I mess up my reasoning, I might make the wrong person the target of my revenge.`
`I don't understand who the enemy is, or how Satoshi-kun was made to disappear.`
`How much did the hag know?`
`That really was a huge loss.`
`I have so many things I wanted to ask her.`
`...I killed her by accident...`
` Shit.`
`In that respect, I've already failed in my revenge.`
`............`
`The underside of Hinamizawa`
` really does run too deep.`
`Scribble scribble.`
`(The whole page is blacked out with scribbles.)`
