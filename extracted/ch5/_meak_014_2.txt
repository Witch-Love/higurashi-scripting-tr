`It was time for the library to close. I had to leave.`
`I bought some food on my way home.`
`I shut my door and locked it right away.`
`Then, I heard the door of the neighboring apartment open.`
`Kasai lived next door.`
`...Nobody else lived on this floor of the nearly empty apartment building anyway.`
`I clearly heard the door open and close.`
`Kasai must've noticed that I came home, and was coming over because he wanted to talk to me.`
`I unlocked the door and shouted out to him.`
`"Is that you, Kasai?`
` I'll leave the door unlocked for you."`
`"I'm not Kasai-san, Shion."`
`That voice...`
` I twitched.`
`"Can I come in...?"`
`"......Sure,`
` Sis."`
`The door slowly opened.`
`......My alter ego Mion Sonozaki appeared.`
`She was holding a box of cake...`
`While smiling timidly.`
`"......Are you going to keep standing there until I escort you?`
` Come in.`
` Sorry this room doesn't look very cute."`
`"...It looks comfortable."`
`Sis looked a bit tense when entering my room. It was her first time here.`
`"How's life...?"`
`"My new school is as boring as I thought it would be.`
` I usually go, but I skip classes when I don't feel up to it.`
` I couldn't do that when I was going to St. Lucia's."`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` So St. Lucia's was really tough, huh?"`
`"Hah, you should go there sometime."`
`"Ahaha, sorry.`
` I brought cake. Let's eat."`
`Mion opened the box. I saw two cheesecakes there.`
`We have the same taste in food,`
` so we don't have to fight if we get two of the same thing.`
`I chatted with her over the cheesecake.`
`I talked to her about school and whatnot.`
`"If you need furniture, tell me.`
` I might be able to get some for you."`
`"Hmm.`
` I finally got used to this room, but I might move out soon. So furniture won't be necessary. Thanks, though.`
` Dad wants me to come back home...`
` I don't want to live with him, but he sounds desperate."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` He'd be pleased if you came home. He looked lonely while you were gone."`
`"Hah, you can only say that because you don't have to live with him."`
`"Ahahahahaha."`
`Come to think of it, this was the first time I'd talked to Sis since I was allowed to live as Shion Sonozaki.`
`She didn't look like how she was at the Sonozaki house that day.`
`The successor of the Sonozaki family and my twin sister are two different people.`
`The demon lives inside the leader of the Sonozakis.`
`Our bodies are exactly the same, except for the tattoo of a demon on her back.`
`Mion's destiny as the successor was set in stone when she got that tattoo.`
`.........It's pretty simple.`
` The Mion from that night was different from the Mion before me.`
`When I was forced to tear off my fingernails, I'd momentarily despised her.`
`But if I were the next leader of the family...`
` I'd have done the same.`
`"......Shion...`
` how are... your fingernails?"`
`"The wounds have closed.`
` I don't bandage them anymore because it looks too conspicuous...`
` but my nails still look ugly, so I don't really like showing them to people..."`
`I sneered at her, displaying my incomplete fingernails.`
`Mion grew quiet and looked down.`
`"......You don't have to apologize.`
` You did what you had to do.`
` You just played the role of the successor.`
` I'm not holding any grudges."`
`".........I'm sorry..."`
`"Okay!`
` Apology accepted.`
` But!`
` If you apologize one more time, that'll be canceled!`
` I won't forgive you for the rest of my life!"`
`"Huh?!`
` What do you mean...?!"`
`"Once you start apologizing, you never stop,`
` so I'm cutting you off."`
`"...Will you really forgive me...?`
` About Satoshi-kun, as well...?"`
`My heart ached when she mentioned his name.`
`...It felt just like the ache of an old wound.`
`"...I figured you loved him."`
`"No wonder. I shouted it out loud in front of all of you.`
` I'm not embarrassed anymore.`
` Ahahahaha."`
`"Granny truly believes you've atoned.`
` She thinks you've done all you needed to do,`
` so the matter is finished."`
`"......That's good.`
` My pain won't go to waste, then."`
`"I wonder where... Satoshi-kun disappeared to, though..."`
`I started choking when I heard her say that.`
`I'd just said it to her myself...`
`I said that I'd forgiven her completely...`
` but that promise instantly evaporated...`
`Just because of what she said, I felt like I'd turned into a completely different person... `
`...What did you just say, Mion...?`
`Did you say 'I wonder where Satoshi-kun disappeared to'...?`
`Who else could know other than you and your folks?`
`What did you say...?`
` Where did he go......?`
`I felt my eyeballs reddening in anger. It felt as though they were about to pop.`
`I choked on a burning sensation in my throat.`
`".....................!"`
`Mion's expression rapidly changed.`
`It looked like she noticed the devil's mask on my face.`
`We were one and the same.`
`...We could understand each other's thoughts without voicing them.`
`So showing our expressions was like unveiling everything in our hearts to the other.`
`"......Uh...... s-sorry......"`
`Even though I'd told her not to apologize anymore, Mion apologized.`
`...I felt like strangling her...`
`I was going to make her confess where she'd hid Satoshi-kun...`
`If she told me she threw him into the Onigafuchi Swamp, I'd strangle her to death right then and there......!!!`
`"I really don't know... what happened to Satoshi-kun..."`
`That's a lie.`
`"...It's true...`
` Granny doesn't know anything either...`
` Please believe me...!"`
`"That's a lie...`
` Are you saying that Oyashiro-sama's curse demoned him away?`
` There can't be a curse... There can't be..."`
`Words kept coming out of my mouth, like I was chanting a spell.`
`...I wasn't speaking by my own will anymore.`
`It was the demon...... who was controlling me.`
`The demon that'd been sleeping deep inside me woke up and was speaking through my mouth.`
`My hands... I mean, the demon's hands grabbed Mion by the neck.`
`"You guys demoned Satoshi-kun away...!`
` You and the Sonozaki family!!`
` Give him back to me!!`
` Give him back!!!"`
`My hands slowly but surely squeezed Mion's neck...`
`Mion put her hands onto mine.`
`...I looked at her fingers.`
`Three of the fingernails on her left hand looked as ugly as mine.`
`"......Mion?`
` What's this...?"`
`Tears rolled down her cheeks.`
`She didn't have to answer...`
` She had the same scars as I did...`
` She atoned as well.`
`The way those wounds were healing looked the same as mine.`
`...So, did she get these wounds around the same time as I did...?`
`".........It was unfair that only you had to go through that... hic... I felt so bad... hic...!"`
`Mion started sobbing......`
` ...I stood there, petrified, still wringing Mion's neck.`
`"...Since I found out you loved Satoshi-kun...`
` I really wanted you to be happy...`
` hic... because...`
` it's always only you who has to suffer, even though we're twins... hic...!"`
`It didn't come as a surprise to me that Mion might also have loved Satoshi-kun as I did.`
`...We've always liked the same stuff, and even the same people.`
`She was stupid enough to feel obligated...`
` toward someone like me.`
`"I...`
` I told Granny to leave you and Satoshi-kun alone...`
` I shouted at her...!!`
` Hic...!`
` Then she said she'd let you be if you atoned with sincerity... hic!`
` And you did! `
`So... you were supposed to live happily with him...`
` but... Satoshi-kun has gone away......`
` That's terrible...`
` That's... hic...!"`
`Mion isn't smart enough to shed crocodile tears.`
`Those tears were real.`
`......Her tears dissolved my demon's anger like how the sun melts ice...`
`"Believe me, Shion......`
` I really don't know why Satoshi-kun disappeared......`
` Neither Granny nor the Sonozaki family have anything to do with it!`
` Granny forgave you,`
` so she would never do anything to him......!"`
`".....................Mion, I'm so sorry...`
` did I hurt you...?"`
`I took my hands off her neck and held her instead.`
`"...Hic... I'm not hurt...`
` You've been hurt a lot more than me, haven't you...?`
` Hic..."`
`......I shouted at the demon in my mind.`
`I believed in Mion.`
`I had been convinced it was the Sonozaki family that made Satoshi-kun disappear.`
`But Mion denied it`
` while shedding tears.`
`Between her and me, her tears are more convincing than any words.`
`So, I'd believe in her.`
`It absolutely wasn't the Sonozaki family that made him disappear.`
`<i>So... do you really think that Satoshi-kun disappeared because of Oyashiro-sama's curse?</i>`
`...I don't believe in curses!!`
` And Mion didn't do it!`
`<i>If it wasn't the curse or the Sonozaki family, who demoned him away...?</i>`
`I don't know!`
` I just know it's not Mion!`
`It's not the Sonozaki family because Mion says so!!`
`<i>That's stupid, Shion......</i>`
` <i>Are you going to ignore Satoshi-kun's voice...?</i>`
`I know, I know!!`
` You don't have to remind me, demon! I can hear his voice!!`
`I know he's mumbling with an ambivalent expression, like he always used to do...... even though he knows help won't come...!!`
`I'll help him no matter what!!`
`I'll save him if he's alive!!`
`I'll avenge him if he's dead!!`
`But Mion didn't do it!`
`You just want to take it out on somebody. It doesn't matter who!!`
`But I'm Shion, not a demon!`
` You're only a part of me!!`
` Don't try to take control!!`
` Fuck off!!`
` Don't ever show up again...!!`
`The demon faded away...`
`My body went limp... and I fell to the floor while holding Mion.`
`"...Shion... are you all right...?"`
`"...I'm all right now... Mion."`
`"...Why are we two different individuals...?`
` Why can't we just be one...?"`
`"Stop it...`
` we've asked ourselves that so many times...`
` but there's no answer...`
` I'm Shion and you're Mion...`
` that's just how it is."`
`"I don't care if I'm Mion or Shion...`
` I just want to be one and equal with you..."`
`"......There's nothing we can do...`
` You have the demon on your back...`
` You're destined to become the successor...`
` and we can't change that."`
`"I don't want that...`
` I don't need a demon. I don't want it......`
` I'm not a demon, I'm not...`
` I want to be a human like you......"`
`Mion is a demon, and Shion is a human.`
`...Even though we're twins, there's a difference between us.`
`Was it impossible for humans to live with demons after all...?`
`......It should be possible...`
` because they did it before.`
`That's the legend of Hinamizawa...`
` Humans and demons lived in harmony together,`
` as Oyashiro-sama watched over them.`
`......Mion.`
` Shion...`
` Satoshi-kun...`
` Demons... Humans...`
`Oyashiro-sama's curse... The series of mysterious deaths...`
` Satoshi-kun's disappearance...`
`We fell asleep while holding each other...`
`While holding everything...`
