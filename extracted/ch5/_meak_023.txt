`"Hey, everyone,`
` are you all still alive?"`
`Kimiyoshi was hanging from the collar, with his head turned up to the ceiling.`
` He didn't even move when I walked in... maybe he's already dead.`
`Satoko was lying on a cross-shaped restraining table. She glared at me with red and swollen eyes, which must have been that way from crying.`
`I'd wanted to put her on that special restraining table to pound nails into her hands, but Satoko was too small for that.`
`I walked up to Kimiyoshi and poked his body with my toe.`
` There was no response.`
`"Uncle Kimiyoshi,`
` are you dead?"`
`"Murderer... murderer...!"`
`Maybe Satoko had witnessed Kimiyoshi's last moments.`
`I took a thick knife from the wall and stabbed Kimiyoshi with it.`
` There was no response.`
`"Uncle Kimiyoshi?`
` If you're alive, you better tell me, okay?`
` You can't fool me."`
`I walked over to the pulley that was suspending Kimiyoshi.`
`"This is your last chance.`
` Are you alive?`
` Let me know if you are..."`
`I paused just for a moment, then turned the pulley.`
`Kimiyoshi's body swayed strangely in the air.`
` It looked much more like a corpse like that.`
`"Shion-san... why are you doing this?!"`
`"Hmm?`
` ...Ah, I get it."`
`The door to the huge cave was still open.`
`I bet Satoko had talked to the one in the cell while I was gone.`
`That's how she knows my name.`
` Although, that's actually not my name at all.`
`"No, I'm not Shion. I'm the real Mion.`
` The one you all thought was Mion is Shion.`
` It's kind of confusing, huh? If you don't get it, that's okay.`
` Heh heh heh..."`
`"How dare you...`
` how dare you kill Rika...!!"`
`I had allowed Satoko to watch me take care of Rika's body.`
`Of course, I let her see Rika's neck, too.`
`"Rika Furude deserved it.`
` She came over to kill me.`
` I just fought back, that's all."`
`"That's not possible!!!`
` Rika would never do a thing like that!!"`
`"If you don't believe me, that's fine.`
` It's none of your business anyway."`
`"What... are you going to do with me?"`
`"I'm going to kill you."`
`Satoko's eyes went wide. She was expecting my answer, I'm sure, but she still looked shocked.`
`I bet she didn't expect me to state it so openly.`
`I heard the noise of something hitting iron bars echoing in the huge cave.`
`Shion's voice echoed there as well.`
`"Sis, nooooo!!`
` Don't kill Satokoooo!!"`
`I answered her clearly.`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha!!!`
` Did you finally realize what you've done?`
` Did you finally realize you didn't do anything to save Satoshi-kun, although you had the power to?`
` That was why he was killed!! `
`You ignored millions of chances to rescue Satoshi-kun!!`
` Yes, that is your sin!!!"`
`"Gyaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`Before even finishing my sentence, I stabbed Satoko's right arm.`
`Her blood started to flow out.`
`...This was nothing compared to what happened to Rika Furude.`
`I twisted the knife into Satoko's arm. She bit down hard, crying.`
`"Stoooop!!`
` Don't kill Satoko!!`
` Let her go!!`
` I don't care what you do to me... but please, let Satoko go!!"`
`Why couldn't you say that for Satoshi-kun?`
` It's too late now!!!`
` I was the one screaming like you back then.`
` But no matter how loudly I screamed, it never reached them, spared him, or saved him!!`
`I want you to go through the same thing I did!!!`
`"Ooo!!`
` Gyahh!!`
` Guhhh!!"`
`I stabbed Satoko's arm repeatedly.`
`But the knife kept hitting her bone. It didn't feel like I was cutting any of her flesh.`
`"Stop, Mion, stop, Sis... stop, stop, stop!!!"`
`"Okay, Shion.`
` How about this? I'll tell you how you can save Satoko.`
` Apologize to me one thousand times.`
` I'll let her go when you're done.`
` How about that?`
` I don't tell lies. `
`If you really apologize one thousand times, I'll keep my promise.`
` Well?`
` How about that?!"`
`"I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm..."`
`Shion started to apologize like a broken record.`
`She's so stupid and honest.`
`She's not even thinking of cheating.`
`I bet Shion really will count to one thousand.`
`I stabbed Satoko in the wrist.`
`There, I felt something hard. I guess I either crushed her bone or scraped it.`
`It must have been extremely painful for her.`
`Satoko screamed...`
`"Whaaaahhhh, wahhhhhhhh!!!`
` Whaaaaaahhhhh!!!!"`
`Shion's voice got louder as if trying to overpower that scream.`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha!`
` All you ever do is cry to get what you want.`
` You think your Nii-nii is going to appear out of nowhere, knock me aside, and rescue you, huh?`
` Yeah, right!"`
`The knife was still in Satoko's wrist...`
` I slid it toward her elbow!!!`
`"Gyaahhhhhhh...`
` gyahhhhh!!!"`
`"Satoko, can you hear me?`
` Hey!`
` Listen to me!!!"`
`I slapped her face several times and made her look at me.`
`"Do you know what you've done?`
` Do you know how your very existence is what cornered Satoshi-kun?"`
`"Nii-nii... Nii-nii..."`
`"That's right. That's all you did to him.`
` Every time you cried, Satoshi-kun protected you.`
` But have you ever even considered what kind of a burden you were to him?`
` He wasn't some superhero. `
`He was just like you!!!"`
`"Gyaahhhhh!!!!"`
`"He was just a normal human being!!`
` Have you ever even thought of what he had to go through because of you?!`
` No, you didn't!!`
` You never even tried!!!`
` You just let Satoshi-kun take care of you!! `
`You just leeched off of him!!`
` And as he got injured for your sake, you lived by sucking his blood!!`
` You are cursed. How can you still call for him?!!`
` Huh?!?!"`
`"Haa... haa, haha, ha!`
` You are now going to pay for your sin...`
` With my help.`
` Cry as much as you want. Scream as much as you want.`
` And realize Satoshi-kun will never come for you. `
`You cornered him,`
` you made him disappear,`
` you killed him!!!"`
`Hah!`
` Hah!`
` Hah!!`
`After telling her all I'd been wanting to, I exhaled roughly.`
`"......!`
` Gouhhh`
`...............!!"`
`"What's this?`
` You don't feel anything in your right arm anymore?`
` Okay, then let's use your left."`
`".........Gyah!`
` ......Ahhh`
`...............!!"`
`I stabbed her left arm repeatedly, and her blood flowed out.`
`But Satoko's reactions weren't fun anymore.`
`She didn't cry or scream like she did before.`
`That put me in a bad mood, so I stabbed the back of her left hand and twisted the knife again.`
`But`
` Satoko still just moaned.`
` She didn't scream anymore.`
`"......What's the matter?`
` Are you stifling your screams in protest, thinking that I was enjoying your cries?`
` Heh heh heh!!`
` That's great, ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`Satoko was unfazed by my mad laughter... She looked at me with gritted teeth and resignation.`
`"Yes...`
` ...I think...`
` ...that's the truth."`
`"...Huh...?"`
`"I cornered Nii-nii.`
` ...That is why he disappeared.`
` I've known that`
` ever since the day he vanished."`
`"..............."`
`"I wasn't... strong enough.`
` I depended on... Nii-nii.`
` I'm sure... it was hard on him too, but I couldn't stop.`
` ...You are... absolutely right about that.`
` I have... no excuse."`
`Satoko didn't sound as if she was mocking me or trying to please me.`
` She spoke so naturally.`
`"Hmm... that's interesting.`
` I never realized you were aware of what you'd done."`
`"Nii-nii is coming back.`
` He will come back someday...`
`And when he does... I'm going to show him how independent I have become.`
` I don't need him anymore.`
` I won't hide behind him anymore.`
` I'm going to show him... That I really can live on my own..."`
`"Hahaha... hahaha!!`
` When he comes back, huh?!!"`
`I stabbed Satoko's arm in a mad frenzy.`
`But she still didn't even scream.`
`She bit down tightly and swallowed her pain instead.`
`"Nii-nii is coming back.`
` I know he is!!`
` I'm waiting for him!!`
` And when he comes back, I will apologize for depending on him so much.`
` So I won't give up until that day comes!!`
` I'll never depend on him again, ever!! `
`No matter what kind of hardships I have to endure, I won't ask him to help me!!`
` I won't call for help! I won't cry! I won't scream!!`
` If I cry, Nii-nii will come for me.`
` So I'm going to endure this by myself!!!"`
`"Damn you.... what do you think you're saying?!!"`
`"If it is fun for you, go ahead, stab me as much as you please!!!`
` But if you think I'm going to cry for Nii-nii, well, too bad.`
` I will not cry. EVER!!!`
` If you refuse to believe me, then try it!!! `
`Nii-nii is watching me. He is watching me endure this.`
` He will see that I'm not like I was before!!!`
` And when he sees that, he is going to come back!!!`
` Come on, try it!!`
` I will not cry!!! `
`Try to see how strong Satoko Houjou is!!!"`
`Shit, shit, shit!!!`
`I'll show her!!`
`Take that, and that, and that!!`
`"Nii-nii, you're watching me, right?`
` I've become so strong...`
` This won't bring me down...`
` This is`
` nothing.`
` This won't`
` make me cry.`
` I won't cry for your help.`
` I can endure this.`
` I am going to endure this. `
`This is nothing compared to what you had to go through for me!!"`
`Shit, shit, shit!!!`
`Why doesn't she feel the pain? Doesn't it hurt?`
`There's no way it doesn't!!`
` I've been stabbing her so much, and the knife went in so deep!`
`Her blood has poured to the ground, and I've been turning her flesh inside out!!`
`How can she still talk that way? Why doesn't she cry and scream?!!`
`After Satoko said what she wanted to say, she shut her mouth. She didn't say a word after that.`
`No matter how much I stabbed her, twisted the knife, tore at her, and ripped out her flesh, she didn't even make a sound.`
`What in the world is this?`
` This isn't the Satoko I know.`
` Satoko was never as strong as this.`
`If Satoko was this strong, she wouldn't have been a burden to Satoshi-kun.`
`Why wasn't she as strong before?`
`It's too late. Everything is too late.`
`This idiot's maturity came far too late...!!`
`Her blood made my hand slippery, and I dropped the knife.`
`"Hah, hah!`
` Hah!`
` Hah!`
` ...Hah!`
` Hah!!`
` ......Hah!"`
`I was covered in blood from head to toe.`
`Satoko was still enduring the pain.`
`She was enduring this cruelty so she could display her strength.`
`I couldn't defeat Satoko.`
`I couldn't crush her strength.`
`Satoko had achieved her goal.`
`She had become independent, so she didn't need Satoshi-kun anymore.`
`She still believes Satoshi-kun will come back one day.`
`She looks forward to a day when she can show her brother how strong she had become.`
`But Satoshi-kun hasn't seen any of that.`
` Instead I, who never even thought that Satoshi-kun would come back,`
` was the one who witnessed her strength.`
`What was I thinking?`
`I thought Satoshi-kun was dead.`
` No, I assumed he was.`
`...Why did I?`
`I never even thought...`
` of waiting for him.`
`I didn't believe he would come back.`
`I didn't wait.`
`...I tried to avenge him, but I guess what I really did was forget about him.`
`...Satoko is different.`
`She never even thought he was dead.`
`No, maybe she did a little.`
`But even so, she waited.`
`She waited for a day when she could show him how much she'd grown. She waited patiently...`
`What about me?`
`I didn't do anything.`
`I wanted to forget about my sadness, so I tried to find my enemy.`
`I became a demon, using revenge as an excuse, so that I didn't have to think like a human.`
`I lost.`
`I couldn't endure the pain of waiting for Satoshi-kun, so I chose to become a demon.`
`In other words, I got rid of my soul, the soul that loved Satoshi-kun.`
`...In other words, I got rid of Satoshi-kun himself.`
`Satoko won.`
`While she had been gritting her teeth before, her mouth had gone slack.`
`Her eyelids were half shut, but I could see her eyes a little.`
`They looked like she was dreaming about something happy.`
`Satoshi-kun...`
` was there, in her eyes.`
`Satoko`
` endured......`
` until Satoshi-kun came for her......`
`Satoko ran up to Satoshi-kun.`
`She jumped onto him.`
`Satoshi-kun hugged her`
` and they spun around.`
`You can cry now.`
`Satoshi-kun told Satoko that, and she cried very hard.`
`Satoshi-kun rubbed her head so gently.`
`We'll be together forever...`
` He said, and continued to rub her head so gently... so gently...`
`Satoshi-kun...`
` I was waiting for you too...`
`What meaningless words...`
`He was already dead inside of me.`
`I never believed in our reunion.`
`...How pitiful of me to say that`
` just because I saw Satoko and Satoshi-kun together again...!`
`As Satoshi-kun hugged Satoko, his eyes met mine.`
`Shion.`
`Satoshi-kun said.`
`I asked you a favor.`
`What... favor?`
`I tried to remember.`
`What kind of favor did Satoshi-kun ask me?`
`Satoshi-kun looked at me so sadly,`
` because I couldn't remember...`
`...That sad look tore my heart to shreds.`
`The blood flowing out from me wasn't as pretty as Satoko's blood.`
` My blood was a slimy liquid, like vomit with filthy chunks of food in it.`
`That was what filled my body.`
`"...Whether it's a real curse or somebody's conspiracy...`
` I won't disappear, and I won't fall victim to it."`
`"Y-You won't disappear..."`
`"No...`
` not until I buy that teddy bear.`
` I'll get the money pretty soon.`
` I won't go anywhere until then."`
`Huh?`
`A memory of the past... But when?`
`...Ah, of course.`
` This is a memory of the day before last year's Watanagashi. Satoshi-kun called me on the phone then.`
`"......Uh... my aunt is home. I have to go."`
`"Uh... okay."`
`"...Mion."`
`"...Huh?"`
`His aunt was home, so I'm sure he wanted to hang up as quickly as possible.`
`Satoshi-kun paused and spoke.`
`"I'll leave......`
` Satoko to you."`
`My knees and elbows started to shake.`
`My teeth chattered and my fingers were shivering.`
`Satoshi-kun...... asked me to......`
` Whaaahhhh... ahhhhh... ahhhhh...`
`What... have I done...?`
`I couldn't wait for Satoshi-kun to come back`
` so I filled myself with evil thoughts, and acted as I pleased.`
`I didn't believe he'd ever return.`
` I even forgot about...`
` Satoshi-kun's last request...`
`How can I say I love him?`
`I just wanted to forget about my feelings of loss, so I made myself all bloody. How can I welcome him back now?`
`I didn't believe Satoshi-kun would come back.`
`I didn't believe Satoshi-kun was alive.`
`I didn't think he was alive, so I thought he was dead.`
`I believed in his death.`
`I killed him in myself.`
`Nobody else did... I did that.`
`But Satoko believed until the very end.`
`And she was rewarded in her final moments.`
`Satoko wasn't here anymore.`
`She had no more need for her bloody, painful shell.`
`But I'm still here.`
`Trapped in my bloody, tainted flesh.`
` I'm going to rot inside of it.`
`Satoshi-kun was waiting for both Satoko and me.`
`But to be reunited with Satoshi-kun, we had to keep our promises.`
`Satoko's promise was to be strong.`
`Satoko kept that promise until the bitter end.`
`And Satoshi-kun embraced her.`
`My promise was to take care of Satoko for Satoshi-kun.`
`I never kept the promise from the beginning.`
`Therefore`
` Satoshi-kun will never embrace me.`
`Even if I were to rub Satoko's wounds and ask her if they hurt,`
` that wouldn't mean anything.`
`That was when`
` I felt something behind me.`
`It wasn't Satoshi-kun or the thing that scared me before.`
`I didn't know who it was.`
`But it was right there, criticizing me for my mistakes.`
`Then.`
` ...I finally realized it.`
` That thing...`
`......`
` is me.`
`I had always been there, standing behind myself and watching me break that promise.`
`Satoshi-kun asked me to take care of Satoko,`
` yet I didn't keep that promise. I had been watching that happen.`
`I cried`
` and gave up on myself...`
`Wait.`
` Satoshi-kun gave up on me...`
` and I gave up on myself.`
` ...What will happen to me now?`
`I don't want to be in this darkness. I don't want to be all bloody...`
`Please don't leave me.`
`If I give up on myself, what will happen to my body?`
`There will be...`
` ....nothing left!!!`
`The only thing I'll have left in me is an evil demon!`
`Ah... I get it.`
`I've known it for a long time now.`
` I am...`
` nothing but a demon.`
`"Wahaha, hahahahahahaha...`
` Ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha!!!"`
`A demon doesn't feel sad.`
`A demon's heart can never be in pain.`
`A demon doesn't cry...!`
`Shion was still apologizing.`
`She believed that was the only way for her to save Satoko.`
`Her voice was growing hoarse and weak.`
`"Shion!!!`
` You don't need to count anymore. Good job."`
`"Whaaahhhhhh..."`
`I guess she realized what happened to Satoko.`
` Shion cried in her cell.`
`"Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!`
` Being a demon isn't that bad, huh?`
` I never knew how fun it would be to see other people cry and scream.`
` I've already had plenty of fun in this human world. `
`Maybe soon I'll kill myself and go back to Hell.`
` But don't worry.`
` I'll make sure I kill you first.`
` That's why I'm here, after all.`
` Demons are pleased when they see people cry and grieve, see?`
`...Wait, you like Kei-chan, don't you?`
` Okay, I'll rip Kei-chan apart before your eyes!!`
` What a great idea!!`
` I'll kill you, and then myself after that.`
` Onigafuchi Village is a village of demons!! `
`Demons came out from the swamp and attacked the village.`
` I'm going to act like those legendary demons and wait for Oyashiro-sama to judge me.`
` That will be a suitable disaster for Hinamizawa, don't you think? `
`Ahahahahaaaaa hahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Ah, Kei-chan?`
` It's me.`
` It's Shion.`
`You took a long time to pick up. I thought you weren't home, and I was about to hang up."`
`"Ah...`
` ah, sorry...`
` I was just... in the bath."`
`"...Wouldn't your family pick up for you?`
` Could... your parents be out right now, Kei-chan?"`
`"Well, no... They're not really...`
` A-A-A-Anyway!!`
` Have you heard?!`
` About Rika-chan and Satoko?"`
`"No.`
` ...What happened after that?`
` Were they found?"`
`"............Nah.`
` ...They haven't found them yet."`
`"......Kei-chan, please don't lose hope..."`
`".........Rika-chan and Satoko...`
` ...They were kidnapped, weren't they..."`
`"...Yes.`
` I don't think there's much doubt..."`
`".........Rika-chan and Satoko were...`
` Ah, no... I mean...`
` I'm sorry.`
` ...Umm...... About the mayor...`
` ...What do you think happened... after he was kidnapped...?`
` Do you think... he's still alive...?"`
`Keiichi sounded confused.`
`He wanted to believe Satoko and Rika were still alive, which was why he was asking.`
`Keiichi was just like Satoko.`
`Unless the culprit was after money, the abductee would usually get killed right away.`
`I'd never assume they'd still be alive.`
`But Keiichi was trying to hold on to a little hope.`
`I could feel his strength.`
`...It was much greater than mine.`
`I'm a demon,`
` so I didn't come up with an excuse.`
`"I think he was killed."`
`"...He...`
` ......Hey, wait...`
` ...That was abrupt..."`
`"...I think it must be really hard to kidnap someone and keep them like they are.`
` ...As long as they're not hostages, it would be most practical to kill them once you were done with them."`
`"K-K-K-Kill them... So readily...`
` I-I mean, what's a human life or two, anyway...?!?!"`
`"......It's a horrible thing, but...`
` That's probably what happened."`
`"If the mayor was killed...`
` then did that mean`
` the same had happened...`
` to Rika-chan and Satoko...?!?!`
` ...N-No...`
` That couldn't... They weren't some random old man!!`
` It was Rika-chan!`
` It was Satoko!! `
`Th-They couldn't... They couldn't kill them so easily......!"`
`Keiichi was still refusing to believe what I said.`
`He fought so hard because he didn't want to kill his friends within him.`
`...I wasn't like that.`
`I killed Satoshi-kun within me so easily.`
`I blamed Shion for not protecting Satoshi-kun,`
` but I killed him so easily.`
`"It's probably better to think that Rika-chan and Satoko-chan`
` ended up the same way."`
`"Whooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...!!!!"`
`Keiichi`
` roared`
` and cried.`
`It was like their deaths were physically agonizing to him.`
`"Why?!`
` Why... Why kidnap someone and then kill them...?!?!`
` Screw curses! Are people's lives really that cheap?!`
` Erasing them and killing them without a second thought like this!!"`
`"...You're right.`
` ...You're absolutely right.`
` ...It would take a demon..."`
`Hahahaha...`
`I laughed at myself.`
` I was sure Keiichi didn't notice.`
`"Hey, Shion.`
` ...Please, tell me.`
` ...Why did Hinamizawa start needing someone to die on the night of Watanagashi?"`
`"......That's what I'd like to know."`
`"The fighting over the dam project is already over and done with!!`
` ...Haven't enough people been cursed already?!`
` Why is it? Why?!?`
` If there's a reason, then say it, now!!!"`
`"...I understand how you feel, Kei-chan, I really do.`
` ...The dam conflict ended a long time ago.`
`Yet, murders and disappearances keep happening every year under the guise of Oyashiro-sama's curse.`
` ...Why?!`
` Why is it happening?! `
`Some of them had nothing to do with it, and some of them didn't deserve to be cursed, so why?`
` ...Why?!?!"`
`"That's what I'm asking yooouuuuu!!!!"`
`"I want to know that as much as anyone!!!!"`
`Of course...`
` The curse of Oyashiro-sama never existed.`
`It was just a bizarre environment that allowed people to kill in the name of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The environment, and nothing more.`
`Nothing would have happened unless there were demons who danced within it.`
`"Listen.`
` ...Oyashiro-sama's curse never existed. It's too unrealistic. `
`Just like you said, someone in the village is using the guise of Oyashiro-sama's curse`
` as a justification for continuing these murders and disappearances every Watanagashi!!!`
` ...They were cunning. `
`They've been using the curse as a convenient tool, and made a system where they would get rid of two enemies in the village every year...`
` and this year, that system killed Takano-san and Tomitake-san!!"`
`"Then why wasn't that enough?!`
` Why did the mayor and Rika-chan and Satoko have to get killed too?!`
` I don't give a shit about the past!!`
` The only thing I care about is why Rika-chan and Satoko needed to be killed!! `
`Why is that?!`
` I didn't say a word to Satoko, you know!!!`
` Why even her...`
` Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!?!"`
`Satoshi-kun was speaking through Keiichi's mouth.`
`How could I respond?`
`I didn't know what to say.`
`I could only feel myself being stabbed by the sharpness of those words.`
`".........Kei-chan...`
` ...please... ...stop being mean... `
` ...hic...`
` .........I don't have any idea what's going on either...`
` Everything changed... when we went into the ritual storehouse that night......"`
`"........."`
`".....When I heard...`
` that Takano-san and Tomitake-san had been killed that night, I doubted my ears.`
` ...Then... I realized it instantly.`
` ...I realized... what sort of a position I was in now...`
`The four of us snuck in there.`
` ...Kei-chan, you and I won't be so conveniently forgiven...`
` ...When I thought about that, it made my chest so tight... It was so terrifying...`
` You know that feeling, Kei-chan, don't you...?`
`...That's why I...`
` confessed everything to Uncle Kimiyoshi...`
` ...He wasn't mad...`
` ...He smiled, and told me if I was really sorry, I'd never be demoned away... `
`...He really did... smile at me... and told me... to leave it to him...`
` ......ooh...!!"`
`I remembered Uncle Kimiyoshi speaking ill of Satoshi-kun.`
`I killed him, but everyone in Hinamizawa did that.`
`I wasn't the only one at fault...!`
`".........`
`...When...`
` did you let the mayor know...?"`
`"...Hic...`
` ...Huh...?"`
`".........I'm sorry... Shion.`
` ......It must seem like I'm kicking you while you're down, but...`
` ...Shion, you... told him, right?`
` You told old man Kimiyoshi... the mayor?"`
`"...Yes...`
` .........hic........."`
`"............When...`
` did you let him know?"`
`"............Eh..."`
`Keiichi's tone was becoming sharper.`
`That edge was cruel, but it was a sharp conviction.`
`It wasn't a dull edge that caused excessive pain.`
` ...It had a clean, pleasant sharpness to it.`
`"...Did you know that the mayor had a severe case of hemorrhoids and had gone to the hospital for treatment...?"`
`"......Umm......`
` Kei-chan...?`
` ...What does that... have to...?"`
`"...Please, answer me.`
` If you didn't know, then just say so."`
`"......I knew that...`
` he had hemorrhoids...`
` ...It looked like sitting down was really hard for him..."`
`"He was going to the hospital.`
` ...You know which hospital, right?"`
`"............`
`I'm sorry,`
` I don't know that much, but...`
` ......Kei-chan...`
` What does that have to do with..."`
`"......I want to ask you straight.`
` ...Shion...`
` when did you tell the mayor about everything?`
` When and where?`
` ...You can give me a rough answer... but please, give me one."`
`".........Kei-chan...`
` Why are you asking that...`
` ...hic..."`
`Very good, Keiichi Maebara.`
` You know who I am, don't you?`
`"...It was impossible.`
` ...The day the mayor disappeared.`
` From dawn until he vanished.`
` ...There was no opportunity for you to contact him."`
`"............Eh...`
` Th......`
` That's..."`
`"The mayor left first thing in the morning for his examination at the university hospital all by himself, without telling anyone.`
` ...Shion, you just said you don't know what hospital he went to. `
`...So you couldn't have contacted the mayor until he got back.`
` ...Isn't that right...?"`
`"............Hic..."`
`"His train back was delayed by an accident, and he didn't return to his house until the meeting was about to start.`
` ...So there was no time for you to have told him before the meeting started, either.`
` Shion, did you go to the meeting too...?`
`Did you attend it... and tell him there?`
` If you didn't... then there wouldn't have been any time left.`
` ...After the meeting was over, the mayor disappeared on his way home."`
`".........Umm...... Actually, with the meeting, I..."`
`"You didn't even go to the part-time job you said you went to that day.`
` ...I'll cut to the chase.`
` ...You haven't... been seen since we were at the library together."`
`".........Kei-chan...`
` I, well..."`
`"...Shion Sonozaki...`
` disappeared...`
` the day after Watanagashi."`
`Ahahahahaha...`
` Bingo, Kei-chan.`
` I'm impressed.`
`"...Ooishi-san says you've been missing.`
` ...Despite that... you've been calling me every night like this, haven't you...?`
` ......Please, Shion.`
` ...If something I said was wrong... please say so.`
` Shion, I'm begging you..."`
`Corner me even further...`
`Corner me so the demon inside can't come up with excuses, so that it can't escape.`
`".........Hic......`
` hic......`
` hic......`
`..."`
`"Shion, there's no way you could have seen the mayor, but...`
` if you did see him......"`
`...The only time...`
` I could possibly have seen him on that day was...`
`"...Then you saw him after the meeting.`
` ...In other words!`
` ...It could have only been right before he disappeared`
` or else... afterward!!!!"`
`"......Hic...... hic......`

` Click!`
`I screeched and screeched with laughter, then slammed down the phone.`
`Very good, Kei-chan!!`
`That's right, it's me. I'm the one!`
`Hurry and corner me.`
` Hurry, let me be...`
` free.`
`Ahahahaha, ah ha ha ha ha ha...!`
`Was he going to tell the police, or was he going to come here by himself?`
` I wondered which it would be...`
`If the police came, I'd struggle as much as I was able.`
`I'd see how good Ooishi would be at catching a demon.`
`If Kei-chan came here alone...`
`That wouldn't be smart of him.`
` He couldn't complain about being eaten by a demon, then.`
`I'm going to kill him.`
` I'm going to kill him gruesomely while Shion watches.`
`Therefore, Kei-chan, you shouldn't hold back.`
`I only ever thought you were just a funny guy. I never thought I could expect`
` so much from you...`
