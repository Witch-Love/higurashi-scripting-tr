`After collecting miracles from all seven Fragments,`
` I've finally got ahold of this one.`
`This Fragment holds our final fate.`
`But before we take a peek, please wait for just a little bit.`
`The fate that's inside will be decided the moment we take a peek.`
`Have I told you about the story of the cat in the box?`
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
`If you open the box, you'll know, but you won't know until you open it.`
`It could be alive and it could be dead.`
`In other words, before you open the box,`
` the living cat and the dead cat simultaneously coexist.`
`And the moment you open the box and find out the truth, the incorrect answer disappears.`
`The inside of this Fragment is the same principle.`
`The future we desire and the future Takano desires simultaneously coexist.`
`They are opposing and denying each other.`
`Once we take a peek, one of those futures will disappear.`
`If we have enough pieces`
` we can take a look inside this Fragment.`
`But...`
`We've only had the same pieces lined up the same way on the game board.`
`And the game under the same condition was Takano's complete victory.`
`We've already tried that in the Minagoroshi Fragment.`
`We need more pieces.`
`We need the help of a piece that's powerful enough to defeat Rule Y.`
`Until I get hold of that piece,`
` it's too scary to take a peek inside this Fragment.`
`But how do I get such a piece?`
` It's a piece I've never gotten ahold of before.`
`To obtain it,`
` I need to look`
` just one more time.`
`I need one more miracle to obtain that piece.`
