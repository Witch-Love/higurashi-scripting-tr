`The only time we were allowed to exchange words with our roommates was right after turning the lights off to go to bed.`
`Being located in the middle of the mountains, the orphanage was very quiet at night.`
`After making sure the staff members were far enough from our room, we enjoyed talking amongst ourselves.`
` That was the only leisure time allowed to us.`
`Though it wasn't anything nice like enjoying pleasant conversation.`
`Why? Because we mostly talked about others behind their backs.`
`We spoke of things like 'that member of staff is only strict or unfair or malicious towards this person', and so on.`
` We just repeated those topics forever until someone couldn't keep themself awake anymore.`
`We even discussed how we could get back at the staff,`
` and we took revenge on all of them in our imagination.`
` Some kids even started to cry when talking about it, difficult as it was for us.`
`Although the subjects we spoke of were negative, talking about them was the only way to vent our frustration... and even though we felt despair about tomorrow, we were able to fall asleep.`
`But sometimes, a different subject popped up.`
`It was about`
` the Yurigaoka House of Love and Mercy`
` on the other side of the river.`
`"...Yeah.`
` Over there, I hear they get not only nap time, but snack time too.`
` Plus, their president is a very nice person..."`
`The House of Love and Mercy was a privately run orphanage, just like the one I was at.`
`But it was a very kind facility, unlike ours... It seemed like a fantasy land compared to our current environment.`
`A few years before, when this place was a lot worse, a few children tried to escape.`
`(It was hard to believe`
` there was a time when this orphanage was even worse to live at...)`
`Supposedly, three or four people tried to escape.`
`I don't know the exact number, though.`
`They headed to The House of Love and Mercy.`
`Their escape was a success.`
`Except for one unlucky child, they were able to get to the property of The House of Love and Mercy.`
`I guess the staff couldn't follow them into the other orphanage's property.`
`In other words, the other facility's property had to be out of their jurisdiction.`
`The staff were frustrated that kids got away from them...`
` ...and they dragged the one they caught back here.`
`I'm sure they wanted to bring back the others who got away from them too.`
`I'm certain the staff were determined not to let a single one escape.`
` It was easy to see that determination in the obstinate way they locked the place up after that event.`
`But they were never able to bring back the ones that got away.`
`No matter how much the staff were mortified, they couldn't reclaim the children and punish them.`
`In other words, if you could make it to The House of Love and Mercy, then you could escape the evil clutches of this hell...`
`On the other hand... the one they caught went through such misery afterwards.`
`...Yet the exact details of how he was punished were never passed down.`
`All that remained were ominous phrases left by those who knew him at the time.`
`"The Drowned Ducky"`
` "The Mashed Caterpillar"`
` "The Splayed Piggy"`
`I can't even imagine what kind of punishments they were.`
`The only thing I can say is that those punishments were supposed to be far more harsh than the Casket Punishment, which was the most cruel punishment I knew at the time.`
`I can only imagine how horrible those punishments were from their ominous names.`
`After that,`
` the captured kid's wish came true`
` and he was able to leave the orphanage.`
`Was he able to leave this orphanage safely`
` and enjoy his freedom while breathing in fresh air under the blue sky?`
`Well, according to the rumors...`
` that wasn't what happened at all.`
`"While he was playing in the boiler room,`
` he slipped and fell,`
` injured his brain, and died."`
`The children were instructed`
` not to go into the boiler room after that incident.`
`Everyone knew the boiler room was always locked.`
`So everyone knew.`
`He was killed.`
`And not just that.`
`He was killed after being tortured.`
`He was killed to teach the other children that they would face hell on Earth if they tried to escape.`
`Yet those who faced that risk and made it out...`
` obtained ordinary, average lives full of Love and Mercy's namesake, `
`which were far better conditions than we lived in here.`
`Maybe The House of Love and Mercy was really Heaven.`
`Maybe all the orphanages are pretty much the same.`
`But compared to my orphanage, I bet anything else would have been better.`
`Even if someone escaped successfully, the police would catch him.`
`Then he'd be sent back to the orphanage.`
`Which would be pretty much the same as being killed.`
`However, if he could reach The House of Love and Mercy, they'd take him in.`
` They wouldn't send him back.`
`By talking about escaping to The House of Love and Mercy, we were trying to forget how cruel reality was to us.`
`Then one day, the leader of our group, Eriko, said to us quietly:`
`"...Would you try to escape...`
` if you had a chance to...?"`
`Who didn't want to escape from here?`
`It was a rather foolish question.`
`...But that wasn't what she meant.`
`"If there was a chance to escape, would you take that chance, knowing what you had to go through if you got caught...?"`
` That was what she meant.`
`Not one of us could answer immediately.`
`If the previous escape incident was a total success, then we might have thought differently.`
`But after that, the orphanage had tightened up security to prevent runaways.`
`All the doors and windows were locked heavily, and it wouldn't be at all easy to get out.`
`Even if another group escape was planned, the success rate would be very low.`
`Three escaped and one was caught before.`
` Maybe two would be caught next time.`
`No, maybe everyone would be.`
`"...If I could, I'd want to escape."`
`"But The House of Love and Mercy is so far away.`
` The bridge is long, too.`
` We'll all be caught before we get there..."`
`"Besides, we can't even go outside.`
` Everything is locked up..."`
`There were locks all over the orphanage.`
`To escape, you'd need a key for both the inside and the outside, and after the lights were turned off, even each section of the hallway was individually locked.`
`Make no mistake, this was a prison.`
`According to the rumors, orphanages receive government funding depending on the number of children they house.`
`So, if anyone escapes, they lose money.`
`Also, if we were to expose the conditions at the orphanage, they would end up being inspected, and things would get complicated for them.`
`That was why they were so intent on keeping us locked up.`
`"Sure, if there was a chance, I would want to escape...`
` But realistically, there's no way we could.`
` Every door is locked."`
`"......Well...`
` Did you know?`
` The henhouse in the courtyard...`
` ...uses the same key as the door to the back stairs."`
`"...Eh?`
` Really...?!"`
`"Shh!!"`
`Eriko shushed us.`
`Sometimes, mass-produced locks take the same key.`
`Of course, most places use different types of locks so that this won't happen,`
` but the staff at the orphanage must have overlooked it.`
`So there were two locks that used the same key at the orphanage.`
`However, most of us never had a chance to even touch the keys.`
`But there were a few exceptions.`
` One of those was the henhouse.`
`Each room group took turns taking care of different chores.`
`If your group was assigned to clean the henhouse, you'd have to get the key to it from the teacher's office.`
`You were supposed to return the key immediately after you were done.`
`But while taking care of the henhouse, the key was in the children's hands.`
`While the staff would occasionally come around to check, they couldn't keep an eye on us forever.`
`"...Eriko-chan......`
` you aren't thinking about...`
` using that key, are you...?!"`
`"L-Let's not...!`
` It's too dangerous...!"`
`"...Of course it's dangerous if there's only one of us.`
` ...But it's different if we're in a group."`
`"...Wait, why?"`
`"Do you know why only one kid was caught the last time they tried to escape?"`
`They were desperate.`
`...And so to escape as a group, they did something...`
` to increase the chance of success.`
`...That was why only one of them was caught.`
`"What did they do?"`
`"...They scattered as they ran.`
` They dashed in different directions.`
` They waited until the day when there were only a few people working at the orphanage, and ran this way and that."`
`And so...`
` although it all depended on luck, it would increase the chance of success for sure.`
`On your own, you'd probably have no hope, but if the staff were to chase after other children, then your own chance of escaping successfully would increase.`
`In other words, Eriko was inviting us to escape with her.`
`The more children joined, the more each of our chances would increase.`
`But among us, there were children who tattled to the staff for their own benefit.`
`So she had to be very careful about who she talked to.`
`Eriko must have trusted us a lot.`
`Eriko, me,`
` Tomomi, and Kikuko.`
` Four children.`
`"...Do any of you want to stay here a day longer?"`
`The three of us shook our heads.`
` But at the same time, we couldn't agree to escape with her either.`
`"Of course we don't want to stay here a day longer... or even an hour longer."`
`"Even if we did exactly the same thing as we did yesterday, we might get yelled at tomorrow...`
` I can't stand this anymore.`
` I can't stand living in fear of what to do and what not to do so I won't be yelled at."`
`We all feel the same way.`
`We could endure strict rules.`
` But it was almost impossible to endure vague ones.`
`It wasn't too much of a stretch to say that the rules depended on the mood of the staff.`
`<i>This</i> is okay, <i>that</i> isn't okay.`
`Such borderline rules changed daily.`
`And if we were to say anything about that, we would be treated horribly for it.`
`"I will escape, even if I have to do it alone.`
` ...Like I said, the more people that join, the better our chance.`
` Think about it. `
`If they find out about this henhouse key trick, they are sure to change the lock on the back door.`
` In other words, we only have one chance.`
` ...So even if you regret not joining in later, it'll be too late."`
`"...But...`
` Ooh...`
` I'm scared..."`
`"I'm scared, too.`
` If we get caught, we'll be killed...!"`
`Tomomi and Kikuko weren't the only ones who felt afraid.`
`The fear was perfectly understandable.`
`Because all of sudden, the fear of the punishment that would follow had become very realistic.`
`I'm sure Eriko felt the same way too.`
`But her courage was suppressing her fear.`
`And because of that, she shared her idea with us.`
`"...So, do you plan to stay here forever?!"`
`"No, no, no, no way!!"`
`"I know you're scared.`
` But this is the only chance we have.`
` You have to be brave just this once!`
` What about you, Miyoko?`
` Don't you want to go with me?"`
`Unlike Tomomi and Kikuko, I wasn't trembling that much.`
`Of course, I was scared in my own way, but compared to the other two, I must have appeared rather calm.`
`".........Can we really escape...?"`
`Of course, Eriko couldn't guarantee our success.`
` But I had to ask her anyway.`
`"There's no guarantee.`
` But if you join me, I'll have a better chance of escaping than trying to run on my own.`
` Of course, the same goes for you too."`
`Eriko gave a calculated reason... but I'm sure she just wanted a friend to agree with her.`
`...That was probably more important to her than increasing her chances to escape.`
`"Tomomi, Kikuko, if you're too scared, then I won't force you.`
` Miyoko and I will escape ourselves.`
` Two is enough."`
`"...Ahh, well...!!"`
`Eriko rushed the two to make up their minds.`
`It almost looked cold, but that was her way of mustering their courage.`
`Because it was very possible that, regardless of the outcome of our escape attempt, as our roommates, those two would be held responsible.`
`"It's not like we'll do it tomorrow.`
` Our turn to take care of the henhouse is in a week.`
` We'll wait for the perfect time to do it. If we don't feel that it's safe, then we'll wait until our next turn. `
`We'll be very careful."`
`The rotation of the staff and the timing were important, but we also each had to know the way to The House of Love and Mercy.`
`We were planning to split up, so we had to know the area.`
`I made up my mind.`
`"...Okay.`
` I'm coming with you.`
` But let's time our escape very carefully, okay...?"`
`"Of course.`
` We'll be killed if we get caught!`
` I don't want to die!"`
`"I-I'll come, too..."`
`"Me too, me too...!!"`
`Tomomi and Kikuko agreed, and so we all decided to escape as a group...`
`We waited for the perfect opportunity.`
`We waited for the day where only a few staff members were at the orphanage.`
`And we decided to let God take care of the rest.`
`"Ah... it's open...!"`
`Maybe it was the way I did it.`
`Eriko tried to open the lock several times without success, but I got it open on the first attempt.`
`The back door opened slowly,`
` and we felt a cool breeze.`
`This wasn't the world of freedom just yet.`
`...In fact, it was the exact opposite.`
` If the staff were to find out we were here, we would be in big trouble. It was a world of danger.`
`But unless we went through that dangerous world, we wouldn't be able to go any further.`
`"......Okay...`
` let's go..."`
`I think Eriko wanted to say that.`
`We were planning to leave with that as our cue.`
`But what we heard instead wasn't Eriko's voice.`
`"What are you kids doing there?!!"`
`We started to run.`
`It was raining.`
`We all got soaked immediately, and our clothes stuck to our skin.`
`While that would normally be very uncomfortable, we couldn't even stop to think about that.`
`We could only keep running in the rain.`
`We were dashing on gravel, but it felt more like trudging through a muddy rice field.`
`My feet kept sinking and I couldn't pull them up.`
`I was frustrated because no matter how fast I tried to run, I wasn't gaining any speed.`
` I felt a sense of urgency.`
`I heard someone yelling "escape" behind me, and all I could do was run like crazy.`
`"O-Okay, everyone go in different directions! `
`Come on, scatter!!!"`
`With Eriko's cue, we all went different ways,`
` hoping they wouldn't be coming after us.`
`Would we be able to reunite safely at The House of Love and Mercy?`
`All four of us there together... or maybe someone would be missing...`
`No, maybe...`
` everyone else would make it...`
` and I'd be the one who gets caught...`
`My thoughts were interrupted by the voice of a staff member coming from behind me.`
`"Hold it! `
`Wait, hold it right there!!!"`
`The staff members should have numbered fewer than us.`
`So if I was lucky, they wouldn't be coming after me.`
`Praying that the staff voices I heard in the distance weren't after me, I looked back for a moment.`
`If I had time to turn around, why didn't I take another step forward?`
` Why didn't I try to escape further?`
`As I turned around, I felt a huge hand cover my face.`
` Its pinky finger slipped into my open mouth.`
`The hand grabbing my face shoved me into the muddy gravel.`
`Of course, I didn't stay quiet.`
` I fought back...`
` and then I saw his face.`
`It was the scariest face I'd ever seen!!`
` I realized it immediately.`
` He only wanted to capture me alive to use me as an example. `
`And considering what would happen to me afterwards, killing me here on the spot wouldn't pose any problem, would it?`
` ...Yes. He looked at me with unworldly hate, ready to end my life here and now.`
`His pinky finger ended up touching my tongue.`
`The indescribably nasty taste sent an icky feeling through my whole body!`
` Aah, that's it!`
` This is what my murder tastes like!`
` He was going to shove that finger down my windpipe and suffocate me! `
`And so, in order to live, I fought back in the only way I could.`
`"Mmmmm!!!"`
`"Gyahhhhh!!!"`
`Something warm filled my mouth.`
`It felt like swallowing blood after a nosebleed.`
`I spit it from my mouth and ran without turning around, leaving behind the staff member clutching his pinky finger.`
`"You little shit! Damn you! I'll kill you!!!"`
`I heard his roars echoing behind me.`
` It wasn't a man that was after me.`
` It was a beast.`
` He had no interest in capturing me.`
` His only goal was to see me dead. `
`My shoes had slipped off.`
`They weren't sneakers,`
`so they came off easily while I was running like mad.`
`My bare feet struck the gravel over and over.`
`It was painful, but I didn't care.`
`Because if I stopped, I knew what would happen to me.`
`Tree branches cut my face and barbed wires scratched my thighs.`
` My feet and toes were bloody from running on gravel. `
`The blood from the staff member's pinky finger dripped down from my mouth, staining my chin and chest.`
`I was running for my life, with scratches and cuts all over my body.`
` If I were to get caught, I would be killed.`
` If my pursuer had any sense, then I would be killed after being tortured. `
`But if he didn't, I would be killed on the spot.`
` I don't want to be killed. I don't want to be killed!!`
`My lungs and heart were about to explode.`
` My mind was blank from fear and lack of oxygen.`
` I was about to lose consciousness.`
` I might have given in...`
` if I didn't hear the voice of the staff member coming after me!!`
`My knees were shaking.`
`My legs wouldn't move properly.`
`I felt like I was going to fall like a puppet with its strings cut.`
` But I couldn't fall.`
` I couldn't fall just yet...!!`
`Ahh...`
` it was too late. My face had hit the gravel.`
`I felt the awful sensation of falling.`
` And immediately after, the roar of the beast coming from behind me!!`
`"Damn you!! My finger, my fingeeeer!!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"Aaahhh...`
` ahh...`
` ...Hahh!`
` Haahh!`
` Hahh!!"`
`I must have hit my thigh against the steering wheel when I jumped.`
`I can feel the throbbing pain, delayed slightly.`
`I'm sweating all over.`
`I wiped the sweat on my forehead and put my hand on my chest, only then realizing how fast my heart was beating.`
`I rubbed my thigh.`
` I rubbed it in a straight line.`
`That's not where I hit the steering wheel.`
`But I feel like this is where it hurts.`
`I can't see a scary beast in the moonlit car.`
`I have my shoes on, and I'm not covered in blood.`
` My toes are fine too.`
`Someone knocked on the window, startling me.`
`"Major,`
` it's time."`
`"Ah`
` ...oh,`
` thank you."`
`I wanted to take a nap, so I told him to come wake me up in an hour.`
`Maybe an hour was too long.`
` Too long a nap actually makes you tired.`
`I put my seat back up and got out of the car.`
`The cool breeze feels good on my skin.`
`I only see the moon. There's nothing else to see on this mountain trail.`
`My car and a command vehicle disguised as a trailer are parked on the side of the street.`
`I can still feel that bad taste in my mouth.`
` I spat it out on the side of the street.`
`But even that couldn't get rid of it.`
`The taste of blood, saliva, and rain.`
`Sweat from my forehead and raindrops got into my mouth, but I couldn't swallow, so I ended up drooling.`
` That sensation around my lips brought back memories, and I tried to wipe my mouth.`
`"..................Hahh.........`
` whew..."`
`Maybe I'm nervous.`
` That's why I had such a bad dream.`
`I think there's a coffee machine in the command vehicle.`
`An unpleasant cup of coffee will wake me up.`
`"So?`
` Has anything happened yet?"`
`"No,`
` not yet.`
` We just got Gifu's scheduled check-in. `
`Everything is okay over there."`
`"I see.`
` Hey, could someone make me a cup of coffee?"`
`"Sure.`
` Cream and sugar?"`
`"Just cream, please.`
` Ah, no, please put in some sugar, too."`
`I still have a bad taste in my mouth.`
`The feeling of biting and crushing his little finger and his filthy blood filling my mouth.`
`I'm sure a sweeter cup of coffee will wash down that bad taste and also wake me up from my nightmare completely...`
