`I ran into Satoko while on my way to the grocery store for my mother.`
`Satoko said she was going there too,`
`so we decided to go together.`
`After exchanging our shopping lists, it became easy to guess what the other family would be having for dinner.`
`Satoko's family is having grilled fish and cooked vegetables.`
`We're having Salisbury steak.`
`"My, that sounds so very good!`
`I don't mind the grilled fish, but it's the vegetables I'm less fond of.`
` I'm certain there's still plenty of pumpkin left from the other day."`
`"......Then I bet you'll be getting a lot tonight.`
` Poor, poor Satoko☆."`
`"I don't appreciate knowing that pumpkin is going to show up on the dinner table...`
` Haahh..."`
`"......Meep~☆.`
` You don't like pumpkin, no matter how it shows up."`
`"R-Rika, you have some food you're not fond of, don't you?`
` That's right, you don't like daifuku, cream puffs, or anything sweet, don't you!"`
`"......It's not that I don't like those things.`
` I just choose not to eat them.`
` If I wanted to, I could eat sweets forever.`
` I could even eat pumpkin pie too. Nipah~☆."`
`"Oooh, it's not fair that you aren't a picky eater!!"`
`Conversations like this are how I have fun.`
`Satoko is my best friend.`
`I usually don't like grocery shopping, but if I'm with Satoko, I can make it into an enjoyable evening stroll.`
`Near the supermarket, there's a grocers and other shops, forming a little shopping district.`
`The grocery store is busy this time of day.`
`All the housewives in Hinamizawa gather here to shop.`
`Since Satoko and I have different things to buy, we decide to do our shopping separately.`
`"Welcome, welcome!!`
` Oh, Rika-chama!`
` Are you shopping for your mother?`
` What a good girl!"`
`"......Nipah~☆.`
` I'm a good girl who can go shopping by herself."`
`"Wow, you really are a good girl!`
` Here, I'll give you this."`
`There were several candies for the owner's occasional asthma attack inside a sieve full of change hanging in the front.`
`He picked out a sweet from there and gave it to me.`
`It was my favorite flavor, strawberry milk.`
`I put it in my pocket so I can brag about it to Satoko later.`
`I get a lot of fun out of teasing Satoko and making her jealous.`
`She always overreacts,`
`so I never get bored when I'm with her.`
`"What are you having for dinner tonight, Rika-chama?`
` Ground pork... hmmm..."`
`"...We're making Salisbury steak.`
` We're going to put flower-shaped fried eggs on top and draw pictures on them with ketchup."`
`"Oh ho ho ho! That sounds like fun!"`
`I enjoyed that conversation while filling my shopping basket.`
`...But then I overheard some women whispering.`
`They're talking about something that's a little harsh.`
`......They're talking about Satoko.`
`"How long do those village traitors plan to stay here?"`
`"They should just leave."`
`"They don't even have the guts to go shopping themselves and make their daughter do it instead."`
` The women went on and on...`
`Ever since the Houjou family and the Sonozaki family got into a huge fight at the explanatory meeting for the dam project,`
` the Houjou family has been ostracized within the village.`
`At first, there were a significant number of families in favor of leaving like the Houjous.`
`But the main branch of the Sonozakis led a push to completely solidify the village's opinion, and as that tone of unified resistance grew stronger, the pro-evacuation families steadily grew quiet.`
`The public harassment led by the Sonozakis and Kimiyoshis, two of the Three Families with powerful influence on the village, also played an effect too.`
`The Sonozaki family made the Houjou family into an example, to ensure there would be no more pro-evacuation supporters.`
`The ancestors of the villagers have lived here for generations, and the villagers also know that they themselves will be buried in this village, so this harassment put a lot of pressure on them.`
`Who was it that agreed to make the Houjou family the leader of the pro-evacuation group at the explanatory meeting?`
`Those same people no longer said anything, and they even joined in on harassing the Houjou family.`
`The harassment they faced then became pressure from the entire village.`
`The Houjou family is hardly wealthy, and they haven't paid the town council fees in a long time.`
`When things were peaceful, nobody said anything about it,`
` but now that the wind was blowing a different way, the Houjou family was asked to pay off all of their late council fees immediately.`
`It wasn't an amount they couldn't afford, but the Houjous recognized a fight was being picked with them, and they responded to it.`
`And so, the Houjou family quit the town council.`
`...But that only played right into the village's evil plan.`
`Making an enemy of the town council meant facing vicious harassment.`
`For example, the place the Houjous dumped their trash was a provisional dumping site established by the town council and the waste management department.`
`Under the council agreement, only council members could use it.`
`Ever since the day the Houjou family quit the village council...`
`Their trash bags were returned to their front door.`
`Furthermore, all the bags were torn.`
`On top of that a sign went up on the hedge road near the Houjou family.`
`It said "Private road, no trespassing.`
` Only council members permitted."`
`A stubborn old man stood and guarded the road, saying that he would not let any of the Houjou family members pass through.`
`...A private road is private property opened up to the public, so it looks just like a normal road.`
`However, as private property, the owner can forbid anyone else to pass through whenever they like.`
`More and more...`
` ...The village piled on vicious harassment.`
`The fear of antagonism spread through the entire village`
` and people became afraid that if they supported the Houjou family, they'd go through the same thing.`
` ...This has made the Houjou family even more isolated.`
`...The grownups haven't told their kids about what's going on, so Satoko isn't harassed in any way at school.`
` But it wasn't hard to imagine she probably spent her days feeling so anxious she could hardly breathe.`
`Even the women whispering in here aren't saying anything directly to Satoko.`
`But it's not like she doesn't notice their muttering and the cold stares.`
`...When did this village become so cold towards her?`
` ...As her best friend, it's very sad for me.`
`Satoko's shopping experience is nothing like mine.`
`When I say hello or buy things, I usually get treats or a discount. But that doesn't happen to Satoko.`
`On the contrary,`
` she's served last on purpose, and sometimes shop owners even pretend they don't hear her.`
` Obviously, people don't want to have anything to do with her.`
`...Satoko had been weaving through the housewives crowding the shop, telling the fishmonger what she wanted, but she kept getting ignored.`
`...She's decided to keep her smile and pretend she doesn't mind... but I know.`
`It was far too painful for her to endure...`
`At that point, Satoko dropped her coins on the ground.`
`Maybe her finger got stuck on something when she was trying to put the change back into her wallet.`
`I ran through the crowd to help her pick them up.`
`......But as I did, I noticed something.`
`Satoko dropped a lot of coins, and is struggling to pick all of them up, `
`but nobody is helping her.`
`It's not just that... it's almost like they're acting like they don't even see her there.`
`Satoko isn't expecting anyone to help her, since she's the one who dropped them.`
`......But... but...`
` there are so many people around`
` and not even one is trying to aid her...`
`"......Satoko, I'll help you."`
`"Ah...`
` ah...`
` I'm`
` okay, Rika..."`
`That reaction is all I need to tell how hurt she is.`
`Furthermore, when I started to help Satoko, other housewives started to pick up the coins too.`
`As if it's the natural thing to do.`
`...So they can only help if a shrine maiden of the Furude family does?`
`If I didn't help, they would have disregarded her completely.`
`And the fact that other people helped only because I did hurts Satoko even more.`
`I grabbed the coins from the housewives without thanking them.`
` ...I'd rather spit at them than do that.`
`"Th... Thank you very much.`
` Rika.`
` Everyone."`
`If she didn't thank them, people would talk about that too.`
`Satoko forced out her words of gratitude.`
`The housewives looked down at her with blank expressions.`
` ...I can't stand this.`
`...I can't stand what Satoko is going through right now...`
`"...If we're done, let's go, Satoko."`
`"S-Sure..."`
`I grabbed Satoko's arm and pulled her away.`
`...I was frustrated,`
` sad,`
` and bitter.`
`What has Satoko done?`
`Reality is just too cruel.`
`Everyone loves me.`
`But can I share that love with Satoko?`
`...Satoko must be wondering why people treat me so differently.`
`...I shouldn't come shopping with her...`
` or rather,`
` I should have done her shopping instead.`
`"......Satoko."`
`"...Wh... What is it, Rika?"`
`"......I feel bad that you dropped your coins.`
` So here's something that'll make you happy."`
`I wanted to at least ease her pain a little bit...`
` ...so I pulled out the strawberry milk candy I just received.`
`But... Satoko refused to take it.`
`"That candy was given to you."`
`My hand froze.`
`...She saw.`
`She saw me getting this candy...`
`"...That person wanted you to eat it.`
` ...So if I did, it'd be rude..."`
`...Satoko turned her back on me and kept walking...`
`Without even saying goodbye... she continued on to her house with the shopping bags in her hands.`
`...I...`
` I only wanted to ease her pain.`
` But I ended up rubbing salt in her wound.`
`How can I call myself her best friend?`
`If I could, I would have crushed the candy right there.`
