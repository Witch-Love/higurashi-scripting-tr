`"Huff, huff...`
` huff...`
` huff...!!"`
`"......Shit, damn it... shit, shit...`
` Manager...?`
` Manager, come on, say something.`
` ...Manager......"`
`"You idiot...`
` He's dead already."`
`Clang.`
` A loud noise snapped everyone out of it.`
`Someone dropped the shovel he was holding.`
` The shovel was smeared with reddish-black blood.`
`No, not just the shovel.`
` All six construction workers' clothes were blood-soaked, too.`
`One of them cried out to the silent dead body of the manager, which was drenched in blood.`
`"...Manager...`
` ...Manager...`
` oooh...!"`
`"Shut up...!`
` He's already dead!`
` It was self-defense!`
` Right? Self-defense!!"`
`The fight had started after the manager yelled at them for drinking beer inside the office.`
`There were 'no drinking' and 'no smoking' signs everywhere.`
`The manager harshly scolded anyone who broke that rule.`
`So it was the six workers' fault for disobeying.`
`But they drank because they were stressed out by the anti-dam protesters.`
`...That's why they said things to provoke the manager.`
` They told him to step out.`
` And the others went along.`
`The construction workers toiled hard and long hours.`
`That's why they instigated the fight with the manager, to release their stress.`
`They had expected to just curse at each other, or to end up in a wrestling match.`
`...But things escalated.`
`Or to put it more accurately, the manager exploded all of a sudden.`
`The manager had to deal with the residents' protests as well.`
`So he was under just as much pressure... or maybe even more.`
`But how he changed was not normal.`
`The manager was calm at first.`
`But he gradually became more aggressive`
` and it was like he transformed into someone completely different.`
` No,`
` it was like he was possessed by something evil...`
`The men who instigated the fight sobered up when they saw his behavior.`
`Then...`
` the manager picked up a shovel that was nearby and tried to smash his opponent's head in with it.`
`He managed to avoid the hit, but if he didn't, his head would've surely been split open.`
`The manager kept pounding on him with the shovel.`
`Even as he frantically tried to avoid the hits.`
`By this time, the workers had realized this was beyond a simple fight, so they tried to hold the manager down.`
`But the manager turned on them with the shovel too.`
`One of the men tried to protect himself by crossing his arms above his head.`
`...But there was no way that could have blocked a shovel swung with such force.`
`Blood spurted out, and the man groaned in pain.`
`By this time, the six men had realized`
` the manager was not his usual self.`
` This manager would try to bash in their brains without hesitation.`
`Since their opponent was using a shovel as his weapon, they had to find some kind of weapon too.`
`One of them grabbed a huge hammer.`
`Then the others realized they needed to find something as well.`
`To restrain the manager in that condition, it was better to arm themselves.`
`"...It wasn't supposed to be this way...`
` ...Waaaaah..."`
`It didn't take that long for the madness to infect the six workers.`
`It was only a matter of time before they went from restraining him to lynching him.`
`By the time they realized what had happened, the manager was already a lump of meat.`
`His face was swollen. Shreds of skin had been torn off and his muscles and skull were visible too.`
` ...Obviously, he was quite dead...`
`"Fuck!`
` He almost killed us, remember?`
` If he hadn't attacked us, we wouldn't have fought him,`
` right?"`
`The leader of the six, the one who instigated the fight, tried to bring the rest to his side, but nobody replied.`
`And so, the leader became frustrated.`
`He was the one who started the fight.`
` The rest simply joined in.`
`...He was the main perpetrator.`
`Maybe that was why he was feeling so exasperated. He sensed that he was the one at fault.`
`"D-Don't just stand there like a limp noodle!!`
` It's too late!`
` We killed him, and there's nothing we can do about it!!`
` We're all murderers now!!`
` Buck up!"`
`"You ain't thinking about turning yourself in and doing time, are you?!`
` Fuck you!!`
` I can't go to the slammer at my age!!"`
`"We're hiding it!`
` We're hiding this corpse and pretending nothing happened!!"`
`...Some of them knew he was on probation for an assault incident once before.`
`So if he got into trouble with the law again, the punishment would be more severe than they could imagine.`
`That was why he was trying desperately to find a way out.`
`If he was alone with the manager's body, then he wouldn't have behaved this way.`
`All he would have to do was to hide the manager's body and pretend nothing happened.`
`But there were six of them, including him.`
`They were partners in crime, and witnesses too.`
`If even one of them turned himself in out of guilt, he'd be in big trouble...`
`"B... But...`
` even if we hide the body...`
` they'll find out sooner or later..."`
`"Instead... we should plead justifiable self-defense`
` and they might end up pardoning us..."`
`"Don't be so stupid!!`
` Look what we've done! Look at his face!!`
` Who would think this is the result of self-defense?`
` His parents wouldn't even be able to identify him in this condition, you idiot!!"`
`"B-But... even if we hide it, everyone's going find out tomorrow morning when the manager doesn't show.`
` It's hopeless...!"`
`"What's hopeless is your damn brain, you shithead!!!"`
`He slapped the other man in the face.`
` ...The leader had such an evil look in his eyes.`
`"Listen well, dipshits!!`
` We're all murderers, okay?!`
` Keep griping now, and we'll all get slammed with five or six years!!`
` Just one of you here try and blab!!`
` We'll all be locked up!!`
` Don't underestimate the pen. `
`If you're prepared to be caught anyway, then run like your life depends on it!!`
` You can resign yourself to it later when it's time to pay the piper!!"`
`His visage turned more and more demonic.`
`It was the same expression the manager had just a few minutes before.`
`...Was he possessed by the same thing that possessed the manager?`
` The five men started to think that way.`
`Now that they considered it... all the villagers in the anti-dam protests had the same expression on their faces too.`
`The real name of Hinamizawa was Onigafuchi Village.`
`People said that wicked demons lived there, and sometimes they possessed people.`
`...The men couldn't help but to recall that exaggerated story often told by the demonstrators.`
`The manager swung the shovel after his expression changed to that demonic one.`
`There was no guarantee this man wouldn't do the same.`
`In fact, he was still squeezing the hammer in his hand, glaring at everyone and threatening them.`
`If someone suggested surrendering, `
`he'd probably smash their head in with it.`
`"I know.`
` ......To make sure nobody betrays the rest,`
` I have an idea.`
` Heh heh heh.`
` It'll make it easier to hide the body, too!"`
`"Wh...... What is it?"`
`"Heh heh heh.`
` We're gonna...`
` cut up the body, into six pieces."`
`"Wh-What..."`
`They all wanted to object to the idea.`
` Killing him was a serious crime itself.`
` Dismembering the body would be too much.`
`But if anyone objected, he'd be killed on the spot.`
`So no one said anything.`
`"We'll all cut him up together.`
` Remember what the manager used to say?`
` Teamwork!`
` We're all in this, together.`
` We'll each take a body part and hide it responsibly.`
` What do you think, huh? `
`This way, we're all equally guilty, right?`
` Heh heh heh, I won't let anyone give themselves up!!`
` Heh heh heh heh heh heh!!"`
`"...........Ooh..."`
`The five men were all taken in by his ghastly face`
` and they could even feel the fear of the Onigafuchi demons creep up their backs.`
