`A group of boys are playing baseball under the powerful sun.`
`The sound of cicadas makes the heat stand out even more, but to those boys, it's just another kind of cheering from the crowds.`
`Of course, they go through training exercises to build stamina.`
`But the boys don't actually like such routine activities. What they look forward to the most is the free game after practice.`
`The school in Hinamizawa is actually borrowed from the forestry service.`
`The schoolyard is made of gravel, so it's not very appropriate for playing sports on.`
`Compared to that, the grounds at the school in Okinomiya are properly maintained for athletic activities, so the kids grow even more energetic when they come here.`
`Kids from Hinamizawa really don't care if the ground is made of gravel or not.`
`The other instructor is watching the game, so I decided to go get some drinks for the team.`
`"Coach, where are you going?"`
`"I thought I'd go get some drinks for everyone.`
` Do you mind helping me, Satoshi-kun?"`
`"Oh no,`
` not at all!"`
`Satoshi-kun decided to come along with me.`
`Sometimes kids don't like what grownups choose, so I'm glad he agreed to help.`
`Satoshi-kun and I got in the car and headed to the grocery store nearby.`
`"Manager...`
` How is Satoko doing?"`
`"Well,`
` she's doing fine.`
` Although it's an extremely slow process, her emotional wounds are healing.`
` I think we should let her rest for a little longer."`
`It's natural for Satoshi-kun to be worried.`
`Satoko-chan has been in the hospital for over two weeks.`
`Of course, he doesn't know his sister has Hinamizawa Syndrome. Not only that, she's almost at L5. She could become deranged at any moment.`
`He believes she's depressed because of the shock of their parents' accident.`
`He came to the clinic every day to cheer his sister up,`
` but Satoko-chan has become emotionally unstable and was showing some dangerous symptoms, so we called off the visits.`
`In fact... Satoko-chan is not doing so well.`
`L5, the stage Satoko-chan is at, is a very abnormal one.`
`The man from last year, who was at the same stage, was acting so abnormal that even a drug addict in his final stages would've turned and ran.`
`There's no guarantee Satoko-chan won't fall into the same condition.`
`When we performed the autopsy on that man last year, we learned the true identity of the syndrome, and gained a great understanding of its mechanisms.`
`We even discovered some important facts that may lead to the development of a cure.`
`However, we have yet to find a method of actually curing the disease.`
` ...So if Satoko-chan becomes unrecoverable, we may have to dissect her, just like we did the man from last year.`
`How can I tell Satoshi-kun about his sister's situation? All I can do is make vague comments and lie to him that she's recovering.`
`What if she becomes much worse?`
`...That would make me an unforgivable liar.`
`The tiny bit of conscience that remains in me hurts.`
`"......If it's okay with your clinic...`
` can she stay there a little longer?"`
`"...Why are you saying that?"`
`I thought he wanted her to come home as soon as possible, so I'm a little surprised.`
`"Well...`
` actually...`
` Satoko doesn't get along with our aunt."`
`"I heard she didn't get along with her parents...`
` but she can't get along with your aunt and uncle either?"`
`"......Satoko doesn't open up to grown-ups."`
`Satoshi-kun has told me about their family background.`
`Their mother's constant remarriages wounded her children deeply.`
`Satoshi-kun was able to overcome it, but Satoko-chan was too young to be able to do that.`
`That left her traumatized, and she now has the tendency to distrust or dislike guardians who aren't related to her.`
`...Actually, nobody would like a guardian who isn't related to them.`
` It's not just Satoko-chan.`
`But usually people try to deal with that, even if they don't like it.`
`...I guess Satoko-chan's not capable of that.`
`"Our uncle isn't home much. Besides, even when he is, he's either sleeping or watching TV, so he's not the problem...`
` ...But our aunt really goes after Satoko."`
`"...Why doesn't she like her?"`
`I can guess why.`
`Satoko-chan's parents were dam proponents and because of that, the villagers considered the aunt and uncle part of the Houjou family and ostracized them as such.`
`Moreover, they passed away suddenly in an accident and left two children behind, so I guess there would be more hate there than gratitude.`
`If she had been obedient like Satoshi-kun, everything would've been fine...`
`But Satoko-chan can't be that way.`
`She shows that in her attitude and expressions, which leads to her and her aunt having a big fight.`
`"...I've told my aunt about Satoko's situation...`
` But she just can't understand..."`
`"I think you're a great big brother, Satoshi-kun.`
` You're the one and only relative Satoko-chan has left now..."`
`"...Right. ...I feel that way too."`
`Satoshi-kun said with a slight hint of a sigh.`
`He doesn't say it, but it seems Satoshi-kun has grown tired of having to cover for Satoko-chan every time she and her aunt fight.`
`He's a good person, as well as a good big brother.`
`So I'm sure he'll do anything to cover for his sister.`
` ...But that's a very exhausting thing to keep doing forever.`
`Satoshi-kun was already doing that when their parents were alive.`
`And eventually, his mental equilibrium couldn't handle the strain, he grew sick, and he visited my clinic.`
`I thought his circumstances might have improved after their initial cause--his parents--were gone...`
`But it seems things were even worse than before.`
`"I understand.`
` I can't release Satoko-chan if things are like that. Her symptoms may return again.`
` Don't worry about the hospital fees.`
` I'll make sure Satoko-chan truly recovers."`
`While trying to pretend I'm listening to his request, I feel a little disgusted at myself for making such selfish excuses.`
`I'll make sure?`
`Takano-san is working on her dissection plan as we speak.`
`"...If that's possible...`
` that'll help me too."`
`"What...?"`
`"I mean......`
` if Satoko stays in the clinic a little while longer, `
`then I can`
` relax, `
`as well.`
` ...That's all."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"...As soon as Satoko comes back,`
` I know she'll get into fights with my aunt again.`
` ...Then it's back to those days of constant fighting and screaming again...`
` and I'll probably get dragged into it too. `
`......So if Satoko were hospitalized for a very long time,`
` that would be the easiest on me...`
` But when I think like that...`
` I hate myself..."`
`"Satoshi-kun..."`
`Satoshi-kun is a great big brother who always sticks up for his little sister.`
` But that doesn't mean he doesn't feel burdened.`
`"To think things like that... what a terrible big brother I am.`
` The more I think that way... the more I hate myself`
`..."`
`Satoshi-kun said, sniffling once.`
`His expression was one of anguish, as if truly feeling his own sin...`
`His desire to be a model big brother is putting himself under greater pressure.`
`I feel bad for Satoko-chan, but I also feel bad for Satoshi-kun in a different way.`
`As someone who knows the both of them well, I feel that I must be their ally, since they don't have anyone else who cares about them.`
