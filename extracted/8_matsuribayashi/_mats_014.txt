`I'd only asked for Tomitake.`
`But Irie had come with him.`
`Irie must be bothered by what I told him this morning, but he can't come to a conclusion on his own, so he wants Tomitake to listen to me too.`
`After saying that he wouldn't interrupt us, Irie sat down a little distance away.`
`"I heard from Director Irie...`
` Why are you suspicious of Takano-san?`
` She knows better than anyone that your death would cause a disaster...`
`...Besides, Takano-san has been good to you and Satoko-chan, right...?`
` And to say this about her now, don't you think that's a little ungrateful...?"`
`I expected this from Tomitake.`
`If I was in the same mood as I was this morning, I probably wouldn't have continued.`
` But having expected this, I'm able to continue without getting upset.`
`"......Tomitake.`
` Please be honest with me.`
` I want you to really think about it, too.`
` ...Of course Takano wouldn't kill me under normal circumstances......`
` but can you absolutely guarantee that she would never do so?"`
`"...What do you mean?"`
`"Takano has devoted her life to the research of the syndrome.`
` Isn't that true?"`
`"...Y-Yeah.`
` ...Just between you and me, she's the most important person at this institution.`
` Director Irie's position is just a formality, and Takano-san is the one who's really leading the research......`
`This is supposed to be a secret,`
` but the syndrome was discovered by her grandfather.`
` Takano-san respects him greatly,`
` and she opened the Irie Institute so she could continue and complete his research."`
`"......So how does she feel now about being told that the project will be shutting down within three years?`
` ...Takano even went to Tokyo and requested an extension, but it was denied, right? `
`...Couldn't you say, then, that the meaning of her life itself is being denied?`
` Don't you think she's hurt...?"`
`"......Rika-chan, where did you hear all that...?"`
`Tomitake went silent for a moment.`
`He must have realized that I'm not just saying random things.`
`"......It...`
` it is true that Takano-san went to see the board of directors, and that she was evaluated extremely poorly.`
` ...According to what I've heard, they really ridiculed her work. `
`She was told that the research project was a waste of money.`
` ......She's been acting normally...`
` but I think she was really hurt by it, yeah."`
`"See?`
` So how can you be so sure that she won't become desperate, thinking that her research is going to be shut down anyway?"`
`"No...`
` no...`
` not Takano-san.`
` ...That's impossible."`
`That's the same thing that Irie said.`
`He kept saying it was impossible, yet he couldn't deny it completely.`
`He repeated the same phrase over and over to refute that possibility.`
`In fact, even though we know Takano is the enemy,`
` we can only guess at her motive.`
`The only way to find out is to tie her down and make her confess.`
`But there is meaning in making Tomitake become suspicious of Takano.`
`...It's even important to do that, so that he'll become my ally.`
` Of course, this is also a strategy devised by our club leader.`
`"......It's rather a scary thing to imagine...`
` but Takano-san won't gain anything from your death.`
` I can understand her becoming desperate, but she has self control.`
` ...Time heals all wounds..."`
`"...Isn't it easier to deceive the heartbroken?"`
`"Deceive?`
` ...`
` What do you mean?"`
`"Tomitake.`
` If I die, something terrible will happen, right?`
` An emergency manual will be executed, and the whole village will be destroyed."`
`"Eh--`
` Ehh?!`
` ......Ah,`
` ahahahahaha,`
` is,`
` is that right?`
` I--`
` I had no idea..."`
`...Tomitake isn't good at covering his lies.`
`It shows that he's bad at hiding things, since he's innately honest.`
` ...Which makes him a nice person.`
`"Irie told me already.`
` I don't want to waste time, so let's be open about this, okay?`
` The emergency manual is a last resort, so if it's actually executed, it'll be a disaster, right?"`
`Tomitake seemed to be wondering if he should confirm the existence of the emergency manual, `
`but the fact that Irie had already told me about it, combined with me being the queen carrier, prompted him to confirm it, albeit hesitantly.`
`"...Yeah, it will be a disaster.`
` It's not easy to erase an entire village.`
` We'll have to cross several dangerous bridges, and it's not humane even if it becomes necessary.`
` It truly will be a disaster."`
`"I'll be straight with you.`
` Someone will benefit from that situation."`
`"No way!`
` There can't be...!`
` There won't be any gains, it'll develop into a hunt for blame, and in the worst case, the problem might expand past Tokyo and into the government...!"`
`"...In which case,`
` there's someone who'll benefit from that commotion, isn't there?`
` If the emergency manual is executed, there will be someone forced to sign off on it, `
`and afterward, they'll start an investigation into the people who allowed the situation to get to that point.`
` ...To be specific, those in charge of organizing the Irie Institute. `
`Won't those manipulators be forced to take the blame and be driven out of Tokyo?"`
`"............Hm.........`
` I, I'm not sure..."`
`"There's a limited number of posts.`
` People are constantly vying for them. `
`So would it be that strange if there was someone hoping to steal a seat by lighting a fuse on this dangerous bomb we call the emergency manual? `
`They could remain hidden in a safe place, and smugly fill the empty seat after everything's blown up."`
`"...............Mm........`
` ...Hmmm......"`
`All this is what Mion suggested.`
`She didn't know a thing about Tokyo, yet she struck its core so hard even Tomitake was shaken...`
`...Mion is the greatest commander and strategist our club could ever have.`
`Tomitake folded his arms. He's starting to lose his cool.`
`I think he realizes that what I'm saying isn't mere nonsense.`
`"......It's true that a big shot in Tokyo just passed away.`
` He left a power vacuum, and there's a political struggle going on over it. `
`Even the Irie Institute's client, the Alphabet Project, had its board of directors purged and reformed. `
`So there's been talk of immediately shutting down the research in order to make an example of the Irie Institute since it was supported by the old faction."`
`"So if I die and the emergency manual is executed,`
` the Irie Institute and the board of directors behind it,`
` as well as the faction that supports them, will be held responsible. `
`...Normally, the Hinamizawa Syndrome and other dangerous bombs associated with it are safe because only Tokyo knows about them. `
`...But when there's an enemy within Tokyo itself, Hinamizawa becomes a bomb that's all too easy to detonate."`
`"...............That...`
` Is that something you made up, Rika-chan...?"`
`"...Is it a fabrication?`
` Or is it the truth?"`
`"...............I-I don't know.`
` But if I think about what's going on in Tokyo...`
` I guess...`
` it is possible for some people to`
`...`
` think...`
` things like that..."`
`"Tomitake.`
` You are a good person.`
` You're a very good person who believes in his close friend.`
` ...So I know if I say these things to that Tomitake, you'll never accept them. `
`......But I have to bring this up with First Lieutenant Tomitake, auditor for the Irie Institute."`
`"............You aren't saying...`
` Are you saying`
` that it's Takano-san?"`
`"Yes.`
` Her request was denied, as was her own life. Not only that, she was denounced by the board of the directors, so she's very hurt.`
` You should know that, since you're always with her, Tomitake."`
`"............"`
`"...Is there any chance that someone seeking to use that heartbroken Takano approached her and instigated her into action?`
` People who are hurt often open their hearts to whoever claims to understand them. `
`Someone like that might have approached Takano to start something that will lead to chaos in Tokyo."`
`Tomitake insisted that Takano-san would never do that.`
` He repeated it a few more times, but then he fell silent again.`
`Tomitake is an adult.`
`He must have experienced some heartbreaking events himself.`
`...That's why he can understand that Takano is very hurt`
` and that it's possible that someone is using her...`
`"...I understand what you want to say.`
` I should clear some issues first before I can truly trust Takano-san, huh?"`
`"Tomitake..."`
`"I'll get in touch with both Okonogi-kun from the Mountain Dogs and the Tokyo office to see if there have been some suspicious reports regarding Takano-san lately. `
`The Mountain Dogs' specialty is counterintelligence, after all."`
`"No.`
` The Mountain Dogs are on Takano's side."`
`"Wh... What...?"`
`"This is someone who persuaded Takano.`
` Of course they've taken measures for the Mountain Dogs as well."`
`"......That...`
` isn't impossible...`
` The Mountain Dogs are a special counterintelligence unit. `
`Even if there was a collaborator in the Irie Institute, it would be very difficult so long as they were attending to their duties.`
` ......But if the Mountain Dogs themselves were...`
`...`
`...`
` Can that be...?`
` ...Hmmm...`
` but......"`
`"Tomitake.`
` Please look into both Takano and the Mountain Dogs.`
` Irie is on my side, but he doesn't know too much about Tokyo."`
`"...That's true.`
` I'm just a researcher.`
` I know my position is just a formality for their convenience.`
` That's why I can't clear Rika-san's suspicions by myself."`
`"I understand.`
` I've been told that there's a possibility the Irie Institute could become rebellious.`
` That's the reason why I'm here.`
` I'll start investigating Takano-san and the Mountain Dogs right away."`
`".........Thank you for believing me.`
` This is the first time you actually have..."`
`I've been laughed away in many worlds.`
`But Tomitake finally listened to me.`
`...He will be a very strong ally in the fight against Takano.`
`Also, I'm grateful for my friends who prepared me to talk to him.`
`I got information on the current situation from Irie, had my friends analyze it, and because of that, managed to get Tomitake to listen.`
`Just as Hanyuu said.`
`I couldn't have done anything if I'd kept thinking about it all alone.`
`But after talking to my friends, things are already changing.`
`"Actually, I'm going into hiding starting today.`
` Mion's house has a secret basement that's perfect for that."`
`I haven't talked to Mion about it yet...`
`but I think she'll understand my request now.`
`"So if you find anything, please get in touch with her.`
` Starting today, please act like I've gone missing."`
`"...Understood.`
` I think that's safest too.`
` I'll act like I usually do.`
` So people don't grow suspicious.`
` Though I'll be careful, of course.`
` ...Dr. Irie, please act normal as well.`
` But always be on your guard."`
`"I... I understand.`
` I'll be very cautious."`
`"......Tomitake, please be careful yourself.`
` I have a feeling you might be assassinated within a few days."`
`"............"`
`This is the part that he has never taken seriously.`
` ...Please...`
` hear what I'm saying!`
`"...Okay.`
` I'll be extra careful.`
` Thank you."`
`Then Tomitake turned around all of a sudden.`
`Irie and I sensed something odd from his behavior and grew tense.`
`Then...`
` we heard some footsteps.`
`We've been so careless. Did somebody overhear us?`
` Did Takano and her people hear what we were saying?`
`"............Nfu fu fu fu fu."`
`I will never forget that laugh as long as I live.`
`"...Hello, hello!`
` What an interesting group.`
` Dr. Irie, Tomitake-san and Rika-san.`
` I've been to Hinamizawa quite often, but I've never seen you three together before."`
`"...Oh......`
` hello!`
` Ooishi-san.`
` Huh?`
` Is today the meeting day for Watanagashi?`
` It's still so early."`
`Irie tried to change the subject, but obviously Ooishi had heard everything.`
`Tomitake from Tokyo is okay,`
` but it's too early for Ooishi from the police department get involved.`
`Things are already complicated. Why does he have to show up now?`
` Anyway... this isn't good...!`
`"Well...`
` when I went to your house, Houjou-san told me you were here.`
` And I happened to run into your secret meeting.`
` ...Sorry to bother you, though.`
` ...Nfu fu fu!"`
`The air froze, leaving only silence.`
`The way Ooishi is speaking makes it obvious that he's trying to sniff things out.`
`I bet he only heard a part of our conversation, so he can't grasp exactly what we were talking about.`
`...That's why he's trying to make us confess the whole thing.`
`"Come now. Don't look at me like that.`
` I'm getting embarrassed.`
` ...Well...`
` I brought someone with me today.`
` Someone Rika-san would love to see again.`
`Nfu fu fu!`
` I wonder if you remember, Rika-san.`
` Because if you don't, he might even start crying.`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`...What?`
` ......Who??`
`I can only think of one person.`
`But did he ever come here in June 1983?`
`But`
` who else would come visit me?`
`"Come on in!"`
`Ooishi encourages a virile young man to enter.`
` He looked a lot more mature than the last time I saw him.`
`"A...... Akasaka........."`
`"Thank you for remembering me, Rika-chan.`
` Hahahaha, you won't tell me to go back to Tokyo this time, will you?"`
`"...A...`
` Akasaka...`
` Akasakaaaaaa...!!!"`
`"I remember... how you helped me.`
` ...Or rather, maybe I forgot at some point.`
` But... if I forgot about it completely, I would regret it.`
` ...So I recalled it. `
`You told me to call Yukie, and because I did, she avoided getting in an accident.`
` You saved her life.`
` And I'm here now out of gratitude.`
` I feel like I've forgotten about it for a very long time. `
`But now I finally remember.`
` Sorry to make you wait for so long."`
`"...Th-`
` That's right, you made me wait forever!`
` And...`
` now you show up in this final world!`
` ......You waited until the very last minute, how dare you!`
` Akasaka... Akasaka......!"`
`"I'm your ally no matter what.`
` I'll believe everything you tell me.`
` And I will defeat whoever is trying to kill you!!"`
`Akasaka remembered some strange things as he talked to me.`
`He remembered the sad world where he lost his wife working on the kidnapping case in Hinamizawa.`
` He forgot about me because of the despair, and only remembered her afterwards. `
`He regretted not being able to do anything for me.`
`That memory from a different world brought Akasaka here.`
`Akasaka calls himself my ally. That means a lot to me, since I never thought I'd have any allies at all.`
`...I could only bury my face in Akasaka's chest and cry.`
`"...I haven't seen anything.`
` I don't know anything about you having such a young wife here in Hinamizawa when your wife's back in Tokyo!`
` Nope, nope, don't know a thing!"`
`"O-Ooishi-san,`
` no,`
` this isn't what you think!"`
`"Akasaka...`
` Akasaka......`
` Akasaka.........`
` Akasaka............`
` Oooooooh!"`
`I complained that I couldn't defeat Takano alone.`
`Hanyuu admonished me.`
`She told me that if we put our strength together and all believed in the same thing, we could make a miracle happen.`
`I didn't believe her.`
`But after I talked to Irie, my friends, and Tomitake, things were getting better and better.`
` And now Akasaka is here too!`
`Was Akasaka supposed to be coming back?`
` Or is this a miracle?`
`Miracles do occur.`
`This man never helped me even once before, yet he might be my most dependable ally.`
` Now he's back, and he's even telling me he's my ally no matter what.`
`".........See?`
` It happens.`
` Miracles really do occur."`
`"...You're right.`
` We can make them happen.`
` If we keep putting our strength together, do you think even more miracles will happen?`
` Then...`
` do you think we can make a miracle happen, and defeat the curse of 1983?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because we can smash through June of 1983 only by putting everyone's strength together."`
`...Hanyuu, who used to be just a bystander, is now persuading me.`
`She's admonishing me for pretending to fight while I, too, was actually just a sulky bystander.`
`"...Are you okay, Rika-chan?"`
`"......Y-Yes. ...Sorry about that.`
` ...Seeing you... brought back so many memories that I lost my cool.`
` ...Meep."`
`I wiped my tears and tried to hide my embarrassment.`
`The higurashi continued to cry.`
`The higurashi have been trying to remind me of something very important.`
` ...I felt like they had taught me something important, and my eyes grew teary again.`
`"Ha, hahaha.`
` I'm surprised!`
` I didn't know you had such a wonderful boyfriend!`
` ...Hahahaha."`
`"Let me introduce myself.`
` I'm Mamoru Akasaka.`
` I work in Case Records Room 7 of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Public Security Bureau."`
`"...Aren't the case record rooms in Tokyo's Public Safety Bureau a secret department on par with the CIRO?`
` ...I believe it's a tough, secret investigation unit that some have criticized as being secret police."`
`No department would be foolish enough to slap "secret" onto the name for the secret division.`
`Real secret divisions have boring names meant to fool the average person.`
`That's true for Akasaka's department too.`
`It's called a reference room, but they don't manage documents.`
`"You seem to know quite a lot about us.`
` I didn't think there'd be someone who knows the true identity of the Public Safety department. `
`...Judging from the conversation you were having, I take it you have your own reasons for that."`
`"...Well, ha ha ha ha!`
` I'm into stuff like that.`
` I just happen to know, that's all.`
` ...Ha ha ha..."`
`"Tomitake-san, why don't you reveal your identity, hmm?`
` I, for one, always figured you weren't just some traveling photographer."`
`"N-No!`
` That is the truth.`
` I just like taking pictures,`
` that's all."`
`What a waste of time this conversation is.`
` This is the final world, after all.`
`"...Tomitake is the one who is connecting us and Tokyo.`
` But he's my ally just the same."`
`""R-Rika-chan...!""`
`Tomitake and Irie yelled simultaneously.`
`To them, it's an extremely important secret and if someone were to find out, they'd get eliminated by the Mountain Dogs.`
`But it's okay now.`
` There's no point of continuing to have suspicions and doubts.`
` I've had enough of that!`
`It's already obvious Tomitake isn't telling the truth, but he's still trying to deny what I just said.`
`"You're Director Irie, right?`
` Thank you for taking care of me when I was injured five years ago.`
` You really did a great job treating my wounds."`
`"Ah...`
` ahh, now I remember...`
` No, don't mention it, I only did my job."`
`"The Irie Clinic is also known as the Irie Institute.`
` Right?"`
`"Ah...`
` well...`
` I mean..."`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` Come now, Dr. Irie, it's no use.`
` We already heard it all earlier."`
`"You were saying that the Irie Institute's client is the Alphabet Project, right?`
` I don't need to hear it from you, I already know everything. `
`Up until just recently, Room 7 was investigating the men behind it and their means for funneling vast sums of money.`
` The Alphabet Project was one of their tunnels."`
`Akasaka is holding the top secret document he got his hands on a few days ago.`
`This document records how certain people were given public funds from ministries and government offices for assisting with various projects.`
`...These masterminds claimed that they were attempting to revitalize Japan by using secret money and secret methods, but that was a lie even amongst themselves.`
`The masterminds of these projects were making an enormous profit off of them.`
`If that became public knowledge, Japan would be shaken to the core, and the government would be overthrown.`
`That was what they were told, and that was the reason why the investigation was discontinued.`
`"First of all, I want to tell you one thing. The investigation by Room 7 has been shut down, and we are no longer working on the case.`
` So I'm simply telling you what I found out in the course of the investigation. `
`I'm on vacation here in Hinamizawa right now.`
` I just want you to know that."`
`"..............."`
`Tomitake is still trying to hide his identity,`
` but Irie isn't.`
` He must have made up his mind, since Akasaka already knows about the Alphabet Project.`
`"We already know that they've been using tunnels to move vast sums of money to a research institute in Shishibone known as the Irie Institute. `
`Also the 'Irie Institute' has a different name here in parentheses, the 'Irie Clinic'.`
` It also lists that the head of the Irie Institute is a lieutenant colonel from the SDF,`
` Kyousuke Irie."`
`"...A lieutenant colonel!`
` D-Dr. Irie, you're in... the SDF?!"`
`"N-No, no!`
` I'm not.`
` Tomitake-san, let me tell them.`
` Putting our clients aside, we aren't doing anything shady.`
` Let's not hide anything. It'll only make Ooishi-san more suspicious."`
`"......Irie is right.`
` Ooishi will help us."`
`I'm starting to feel like even Ooishi could be our ally.`
`That would be incredible...!`
`Tomitake finally gave in and admitted everything.`
`In his place, I explained to them the existence of Hinamizawa Syndrome, the Irie Clinic that was established to research it...`
`...What's special about myself...`
` and finally about the invisible conspiracy that revolves around it all.`
`Ooishi was very surprised to hear about all this, but Akasaka told him to calm down, so he listened quietly.`
`Since Akasaka belongs to a special unit, he wasn't too surprised.`
`He kept nodding, saying that it's all very possible.`
`...This is working out great for me.`
`"Just as you say, Rika-chan, there's a good chance there are some people who are planning something like that.`
` Ooishi-san, what they are saying is well within the realm of the possible."`
`"...Hahh...`
` ...This feels like the plot of a novel...`
` ...Ah......`
` but if it's true......`
` hmmm."`
`Compared to Akasaka, who has a flexible mind, Ooishi is having a hard time understanding such unrealistic stories. He'll probably need at least three cigarettes before he can digest what he just heard.`
`"...I think Takano is suspicious.`
` But there's no proof.`
` I was asking Tomitake to investigate so that I can confirm my suspicions."`
`"Ooishi-san,`
` can you arrest and detain Takano on a separate charge?"`
`"......Hmmm.`
` I may lose my retirement money for that, but it could be done, I guess..."`
`"There are some counterintelligence members from the Mountain Dogs at the police station.`
` Even if you try, Ooishi-san, there will be pressure from within the department."`
`"I'll conduct an investigation on Takano-san, so if possible, can you leave it to me? I don't want anyone to get suspicious."`
`"...You're right.`
` If Takano's investigation can only be done by Tomitake-san's institution, then the police shouldn't bother him.`
`...Besides, I have a feeling that this thing is a lot bigger than we think.`
` ...Ooishi-san.`
` I don't mean to sound rude, but maybe you should stay out of this."`
`"...Akasaka-san, what do you mean by that?"`
`"Just like you told me earlier, you're retiring this year, right?`
` You've worked hard for many years. You're about to collect your pension.`
` Money is important. `
`You'll need it to pay off your house and you need money for life after retirement.`
` But this hill's too dangerous to climb. `
`My instincts are telling me that at the end of it, this case will be classified, as if it didn't take place at all.`
` In other words..."`
`"Unless I'm prepared to lose everything, I better pull myself out of this,`
` right?`
` That's what you're telling me, isn't it...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I know I'm not in a position to tell you that.`
` ...But I've been involved in cases that are much different from regular police work.`
` So... what I'm saying now comes from experience."`
`"............"`
`Ooishi was no fool.`
` ...He was also an adult, and smart in a real sense.`
`If he only listened to his pride, he would yell at Akasaka for insulting him.`
`But what Akasaka is saying is true. Ooishi's pension is a big deal for him.`
`People live far beyond their retirement.`
`They still have ten or even twenty years left after that.`
`Their pension is the basis for that second life.`
`A pension isn't ordinary money.`
`It's very,`
` very valuable.`
`People receive their pension for working hard on rainy days and windy days and even enduring the moments when their bosses give them a hard time.`
`Even Ooishi has mumbled, on occasion,`
` that he's going to quit and look for a new job.`
`Yet, he endured, and quietly did the unreasonable work asked of him.`
`He's endured far more work than his salary merited.`
`He's worked like that for a very long time, and now he's finally about to retire!`
`He's finally about to collect his long-awaited pension.`
`It's not about the amount of money itself.`
`It's about having a value placed on what you've done with your life.`
`So if one were to cause a scandal, the punishment for that would be placed on his pension.`
`...One such deplorable event can erase Ooishi's entire life as a policeman.`
`That's not something that can be treated lightly.`
`Akasaka is still young.`
`Even if he loses his job, he will be able to find a new one.`
`But Ooishi is too old.`
`The repayment of his mortgage was planned around his pension.`
`...Ooishi is a grownup's grownup, and that's why`
` he can't do anything reckless.`
`Akasaka knows that, and that's why he said that Ooishi should back down.`
`Ooishi understands it too.`
`...So... Akasaka had to ask him that tough question...`
` in order to find out how strong Ooishi's commitment was.`
`"...I've been awfully slow paying back my loan, all because I wanted to hold on to some spending money...`
` Even though I would've saved on interest if I'd just paid a bit more earlier on. `
`...But I just wanted to gamble and drink...`
` If I'd lived my life so I didn't have to depend on my pension in my old age...`
` ...I could jump right onto this case..."`
`Ooishi's fists were trembling.`
`...That's how he sheds his tears.`
`"But...`
` But...!!`
` I'm an officer until the moment I retire!!`
` No, even that doesn't matter.`
` I promised in front of his grave.`
` I promised that old man that I'd find out who killed him! `
`I promised to stay a police officer until I arrest his murderer!`
` In other words...`
` me being a police officer isn't the issue here!!`
`What matters is that I keep my officer's spirit until I find that murderer, even if I'm fired!`
` But I...`
` I...`
` am I afraid to be fired?`
` Am I afraid to lose my pension?`
` ...Yes, I am!!! `
`It'll ruin my plans for my future!! I need a lot of money for them!!`
` My dream is to live a leisurely life in Hokkaido, work on a vegetable garden, have fun in Susukino, and take up ballroom dancing lessons! `
`But why am I afraid?!`
` Is my officer's spirit...`
` so weak as all that?!`
`I've dreamt of uncovering the truth behind the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa!`
` And the door to that truth I've sought for so long is right here in front of me...!`
` Dammit! Goddammit!! `
`Why can't I just throw away my badge?!`
` Why can't I stop caring about what the police think?!!`
` Dammit, dammit, goddammit!!"`
`...Nobody could say anything in response to Ooishi.`
`...He's at a crossroads. The crossroads of a person who has worked so hard and so humbly for so long.`
`How could the young people who know nothing about what he's had to go through say anything at all?`
`"...You are...`
` a friend of the departed construction site manager, right?"`
`"............Yes.`
` He was a friend, a brother, and a father to me."`
`"Although it's only a formality, I am the director of the Irie Institute.`
` If the conspiracy that surrounds Rika-chan is exposed, I will be the one who takes the blame.`
` ...Isn't that right, Tomitake-san?"`
`"............"`
`His position exists for exactly that purpose.`
`...To the Insitute as a whole, Irie is there simply to cover for Takano's research.`
`...Tomitake, of course, knows about that, and even Irie has started to realize it.`
`Even if Irie hadn't done anything wrong, he would have to take the blame, as the person in charge of the Institute.`
`...That was how every organization purged itself: by forcing someone to take the blame and reshuffling members.`
`That's why leaders get more money.`
`"...When it's all over,`
` I will tell you everything...`
` about the series of mysterious deaths.`
` ......I actually have an obligation to remain silent for the rest of my life,`
` but you'll let me tell him, won't you, Tomitake-san?"`
`"...Hahahaha.`
`......I didn't hear anything."`
`As an honest man, Tomitake can't say yes.`
` So pretending to ignore it was the best he could do.`
`"...No, no...`
` that's not right.`
` ...You can tell the brave Kuraudo Ooishi about it, the one who found the courage to help you. `
`The cowardly Kuraudo Ooishi, the one who didn't want to lose his pension, doesn't deserve to hear the truth."`
`He faced a dilemma. Even though the truth behind the mysterious deaths he sought so hard was right in front of him...`
` ...he couldn't just accept it with his head held high.`
`To understand what he's going through, one would have to live the life he did.`
`...His dilemma is very vast`
` and very heavy.`
` ...Young people couldn't possibly understand.`
`"...Can I... have some time to think about this?`
` I really do.... want to find the truth, and put evil behind bars.`
` ...I just need some time to gather my courage.`
` ...Could you grant me that...?"`
`Why is he even asking?`
`Nobody here will force him to make up his mind.`
`...Of course,`
` I won't either.`
`However... Ooishi needs someone's approval.`
`Ooishi is still passionate about his work as a police officer, yet he isn't brave enough to take on this case. He wants somebody to forgive him for that.`
`...But nobody can do that, and nobody can stop Ooishi from crying...`
`"...Yes.`
` I will grant you that time."`
`Hanyuu?`
` How long has she been here?`
`Hanyuu has arrived. I didn't see her come in.`
`...But then again, she's always around.`
` Hanyuu is the guardian deity of Hinamizawa, after all.`
`"...I'll grant you some time to make your decision.`
` ...You have been honest, and you've been tough on yourself until today. `
`Your life is not to be taken lightly, and that's why you are having such a hard time deciding.`
` One should never be proud of careless decisions or brute courage. `
`...A careful judgment made by a person who has lived a worthy life, like you... that's what's worth being proud of."`
`She might sound arrogant to us...`
` but that was exactly what Ooishi needed to hear.`
`Right... who among us has the right to admonish Ooishi, the eldest one here?`
`No one. No one should be able to.`
`...Nobody but one.`
` ...The one who has been protecting humans for over a thousand years.`
` ...Hanyuu.`
`"...No matter if you decide calmly or courageously,`
` I will praise you.`
` As long as your decision was made well."`
`"......I've never met you before,`
` but thank you.`
` ...That makes me feel better.`
` ...Thank you for giving a coward like me the time of day."`
`If it was me, I would have asked Ooishi to be my ally, and asked him for help.`
`But that wouldn't have reached his heart.`
`Wanting help is my selfish request.`
`I don't know anything about the life he lived, and that's why my words wouldn't reach him.`
`But Hanyuu's words did.`
`Hanyuu has never told me this, but I can tell she's been watching Ooishi since the day he was born.`
` She's been watching all that he went through.`
`That's why she can say that.`
` And why what she said could reach him.`
` Only Hanyuu can do that.`
`"......Dr. Irie.`
` ...There's only one thing.`
` Please tell me one thing."`
`"...Sure.`
` Ask me anything."`
`"......I've long suspected that the Sonozaki family was pulling the strings in the old man's murder case.`
` ...Am I right to think that...?"`
`".....No, you are not.`
` You're wrong.`
` We can explain everything`
` about the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa."`
`"................I`
` see..."`
`Ooishi pretended to scratch his head.`
`...For so long he pursued the case with that belief... yet someone deeply involved was telling him he'd missed the mark... so he must be feeling at least some frustration.`
`What Irie said wouldn't be enough.`
`So I have to continue.`
`"......Ooishi.`
` None of the curses of Oyashiro-sama were done in secret by the villagers.`
` The Sonozaki family, the Three Families, and the other villagers... none of them are involved."`
`There were only misunderstandings, misinterpretations, coincidences...`
` tragedies, and comedies.`
`The real identity of the curse of Oyashiro-sama is simply a series of misinterpretations. It only looks like the villagers are acting in secret.`
`"...So, all the information I've gathered so far about the Sonozaki family`
` is worthless?`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"...The heads of the Sonozaki family have a secret precept. They must always act as if they command even natural disasters.`
` ...The Sonozaki family knows nothing. `
`Moreover, they are even afraid of the incidents that occur every year.`
` But in order to maintain their dignity, they act as though they're the ones behind everything."`
`"Oh my goodness...`
` ...I see.`
` ......It all makes sense now."`
`"............`
` Hahaha,`
` ha ha ha ha ha!`
` If that's true...`
` then that Oryou woman...`
` damn it... she sure said some things to mislead me!`
` Hahahahahaha,`
` ha ha ha ha ha ha!`
`You're telling me the truth, aren't you?"`
`"...Yes, I am.`
` It's written in the Furude family's secret scrolls too.`
` Do you want to see?"`
`"...Hahahahaha,`
` ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"`
`I have no idea what Ooishi thinks is so funny...`
`Nobody here can tell what's going through Ooishi's mind.`
`......Except the girl who has watched over human beings for over a thousand years.`
`"...I can understand`
` why you're so happy."`
`"What? ...What do you mean...?"`
`"The thought that you don't have to hate anyone anymore is a very, very welcome concept."`
`"Ha ha ha, oh no.`
` The Sonozaki family still is a vile organization with its claws all over Shishibone City. That doesn't change.`
` ...I've been stabbed by one of them before, you know? `
`They may not be responsible for the mysterious deaths, but they are still my enemies.`
` ...That's all still true, but I just feel happy.`
` ...Na ha ha ha."`
`None of us can tell if what Hanyuu is saying is right.`
`Ooishi believed the Sonozaki family was behind it all.`
`Now that he's learned that they're not, I'm sure he feels like everything he stands for has been made meaningless.`
`But if Hanyuu says that's not the case...`
` To hate someone must be such a painful thing.`
`I can't explain Ooishi's laughter. All I can do is speculate.`
`Ooishi left with a cigarette in his mouth, saying that he wanted to cool off a little.`
`"...We won't get anywhere until we know if Takano-san is guilty or not.`
` So we won't be able to act until after we hear the report from Tomitake-san."`
`"I don't know why Rika-chan is so suspicious of Takano-san... Personally, I feel bad for her...`
` But what she said makes sense too.`
` ...Rika-chan is an important person. `
`And we can't let anyone suspicious get near her."`
`Tomitake is making it sound like he's going to prove Takano's innocence.`
`I guess I can't blame him, since he's in love with her.`
`...To be honest, I'm also hoping that Takano isn't guilty.`
`Takano understands me, and she was one of my allies.`
`...I had a friendship with her. I've trusted her for over a hundred years.`
`But Hanyuu says`
` that Takano is guilty.`
`...If something pops out when we poke her,`
` ...then the question is how well Tomitake can catch it...`
`To get people to help me, I have to find proof of Takano's guilt.`
`So I just have to trust Tomitake for now.`
`"Tomitake-san.`
` Please be very careful.`
` If she is guilty, then you'll be in danger too."`
`"I understand.`
` I'll move to a new hotel without letting the Institute know.`
` I should probably leave Hinamizawa immediately, but if Takano-san is guilty, that would backfire."`
`"That's pretty tough, yeah.`
` It's a cardinal rule to act normally during a secret investigation.`
` Would you prefer to stay with me?"`
`"No, that's alright.`
` It's fine, I'll be very careful."`
`"...But Rika-chan's safety is the priority here...`
` What should we do?"`
`"......What should we do?`
` Hanyuu, what should we do?"`
`"Using shogi as an example, you're like an unprotected king.`
` As soon as Takano gets ahold of you, the game is over."`
`"One of the most important rules in shogi is to guard the king first,`
` right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Today is Thursday.`
` Watanagashi is in three days.`
` You need to hide somewhere nobody can find you until at least then."`
`"Any idea where?"`
`"...I think you should ask Mion."`
`"That's true.`
` The Sonozaki family's underground storehouse would be an ideal place to hide."`
`"Satoko should go with you too."`
`"If I leave Satoko behind, they'll question her about my whereabouts.`
` She may be in danger too."`
`...That means I'll have to tell the truth to at least Satoko and Mion.`
`...That the comic plot we discussed wasn't just fiction.`
`...Still, I always seem to underestimate their reliability. It really is beyond my imagination.`
`I need to talk to them.`
` I have a feeling they'll believe me.`
`They're my steadfast allies, after all.`
`"...We're going into hiding for a while.`
` There's a perfect place for that at Mion's house."`
`"Will you really be safe there?"`
`"...Yes. It's like an air-raid shelter.`
` It has everything we need. We can easily stay there for about a month."`
`The Sonozaki family's underground storehouse has every basic necessity, in case someone actually had to live there due to some complication or another.`
`...Mion has mentioned before that it's like a unique vacation house.`
`...I don't know how you can call a place with a torture room a vacation house, though.`
`"I don't know how long my investigation into Takano-san will take,`
` but as soon as I find out something, I'll call Mion-chan's house. Is that okay?"`
`"...That works fine."`
`"To tell you the truth... The Mountain Dogs have a bug on Rika-chan's home phone for security reasons.`
` ...So that works better either way."`
`"......Meep.`
` So somebody has been listening to all of my personal conversations?"`
`"N-No, it's set up so they can tune in, but that doesn't mean they're listening to every normal conversation.`
` They only do it when they have a security drill. That happens a few times a year."`
`"...I bet my phone at the clinic is being wiretapped too, huh?"`
`"...Well, yes.`
` That's because of the purpose of the facility, though... please understand."`
`"Excuse me.`
` How do they actually do that?"`
`"Rika-chan's land line branches off.`
` Do you remember the little shack behind the shrine?`
` The line leads into there, which is where they wiretap it. `
`Usually there's no one there, but once the Mountain Dogs receive orders to guard her, there will be two agents recording conversations in there all the time.`
` Of course, they don't usually record anything."`
`"Is there a security drill scheduled in the near future?`
` Or maybe orders to guard her?"`
`"Security drills take place in January, April, July, and October.`
` So there's no drill this month. `
`Orders to guard her are given only when they anticipate an emergency, but they haven't been given even once since the Institute was established."`
`"Who gives those orders?"`
`"The director does, which is me. But Takano-san is a surrogate director, so she can send out orders too."`
`"...If Takano really is the person who wants to kill Rika-chan, then she'll use the Mountain Dogs to spy on her."`
`"That's very possible."`
`"In other words,`
` if people start to go in and out of that shack, it means that Takano has made her move.`
` So we could take that as proof that tensions are building around Rika-chan, right?"`
`"...I don't know if that would prove that Takano-san is behind it,`
` but we can take it as a sign that danger is approaching."`
`"Indeed.`
` Regardless of whether Takano is guilty or not, that's what it means.`
` As long as we keep our eyes on the shack, Rika-chan will stay safe and secure.`
` That's a great idea."`
`"...But there is one problem, Rika.`
` If there are no lights on in the house at night, it'll be obvious to everyone that there's nobody home. `
`Takano doesn't even have to wiretap your phone. As soon as she sees the house, she'll realize you're skipping school and ran away."`
`"You're right.`
` And that puts Tomitake, who's investigating Takano, in a tight spot.`
` We'll have to think of something to counteract that."`
`"So we're dealing with having to observe the wiretapping shack, like Akasaka was saying earlier.`
` Then there's the problem with having to keep the lights on at your house. `
`It's also a fact that it's better for Akasaka to stay in the village. If I put all three together and mix them up, I get...`
` au`
` au`
` au.`
` I have an idea."`
`"...Oh no.`
` You aren't thinking about letting Akasaka stay at my house, are you?`
` No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not!!! `
`My house is such a mess, it smells and it's filthy, I can't let Akasaka stay in there. NO, NO, NO!!!"`
`"Au au au au, Akasaka is staying oveeer! Au au au au☆."`
`"I said no!!`
` No, no, no, no, no, noooooo!!!"`
`"Why are you making such a fuss, Rika-chan?"`
`"...M-Meep~.`
` I lost my cool there for a moment.`
` Nipah~☆..."`
`G-Geez! Just because Hanyuu's insisting... Okay?`
` Au au au au!!`
`"It's true that if Rika-chan's house ends up empty, there won't be any lights on at night.`
` And leaving them on would be even more suspicious."`
`"Ah...`
` ah, Akasaka.`
` ......Ah`
`...`
` ...Meep.`
` What do you think of staying at my house while I'm gone?"`
`"I see...`
` That's a great idea.`
` As long as it's okay with you, Rika-chan, let's do that."`
`Akasaka seems to think it's a pretty good idea.`
`...Am I selfish for wanting him to get a little embarrassed about staying at my house?`
`...I should be ashamed of myself...`
` Au au au.`
`Everything is set.`
`Tomitake is going to get in touch with his colleagues in Tokyo and start an investigation on Takano.`
`...That's all.`
` That's all we can do from our end.`
`Irie is going to lead his normal life.`
`To act normally after something like this will be pretty difficult, but there really isn't anything else for him to do right now.`
`Takano is sly. She'll never let Irie ruin her plans.`
`Actually, Irie only comes into the picture after Takano's been exposed.`
`Ooishi didn't say he would help, but he said he wouldn't interfere with us.`
`In fact, there are some people with ties to the Mountain Dogs at the police department too.`
`It's probably best if Ooishi acts normally, like Irie is.`
`I'm going to tell Satoko the truth and hide at Mion's house for a while, starting today.`
`I don't know how long I'll have to hide, but it'll be at least until something happens.`
`Akasaka is going to stay at my house and make it look like I'm home, sick.`
`If something happens, coming all the way from Okinomiya would take too long.`
` It feels much better to have him stay in the village.`
`Everything will begin only once Tomitake finds out something.`
`Irie says he hopes things will get moving soon... but I don't think we need to worry about that.`
`They will try to kill Tomitake on the night of Watanagashi, on Sunday, two days from today.`
`That has never changed in many, many worlds, so that's definitely their plan.`
`In other words, even if Tomitake doesn't find anything, the wheels will start turning in two days.`
`I had warned Tomitake again to be extremely careful.`
`...But still!`
` If I still get killed, I'll curse your family for seven generations after I die.`
`It's already getting dark.`
`Everyone went home except for Akasaka.`
` I'm still thinking about how to tell Satoko about Akasaka, and also about what's to come.`
`"Worrying about it won't solve anything.`
` Rika, you have a bad habit of underestimating your friends."`
`"But...`
` how can she believe that what we talked about at school today is actually real?`
` How can she believe me when I tell her that her life is in danger? `
`In addition, I'm bringing home this guy she's never met before!"`
`"Don't you think Satoko will believe you?"`
`"...I don't know,`
` but it's possible that she won't."`
`"Oh,`
` so Satoko isn't your friend, is she?"`
`"...What?"`
`What Hanyuu just said startled me. It was kind of a scary thing to hear, even though she said it while wearing her usual warm smile.`
`"I know Satoko is one of us. I think she will believe you and become your ally against Takano.`
` But you're saying you can't trust her.`
` That's like saying Satoko isn't your friend. `
`If she isn't even your friend, then why waste your time telling her about it? Au au au.`
` Let's just leave Satoko behind and go to Mion's house by ourselves. Just the two of us."`
`"Wh... What are you saying?`
` That's nonsense!`
` Satoko is my best friend and..."`
`"If you don't think it's worth telling her the truth, then that's it.`
` You just think a best friend is like a stray cat that you feed everyday. `
`I'm actually surprised to learn that you've been letting Satoko live with you when you think of her like that."`
`"I didn't say that!`
` Satoko is my best friend!`
` My very best!!`
` Yeah, she's even closer to me than you are!!"`
`"But you don't believe she will believe.`
` It's the same as spouting your complaints at a stray cat that you feed every day. `
`You know the cat can't do anything, and knowing that you still complain to her, and that's all your relationship is.`
` Au au, poor Satoko!`
` She believes you're her best friend, but you don't feel the same way. `
`Au au au!"`
`"Damn you!!"`
`I tried to slap Hanyuu, but I couldn't touch her.`
`My hand went through her cheek and hit only the air.`
` ...I can't believe she made herself incorporeal again!`
`Hanyuu disappeared, saying "au au" in a teasing manner.`
`...I'm upset... but I can totally understand what she was getting at.`
`"Will your roommate agree?"`
`"I'll make her agree.`
` Satoko has nothing to do with this conspiracy, but since she lives with me, she's going to end up involved anyway.`
` For Satoko's sake, I have to explain this to her."`
`"...Should I wait outside?"`
`"No,`
` I think it'll be better to have you with us so she doesn't think it's a joke.`
` If I can't explain it properly, can you help?"`
`"Sure.`
` I will."`
`I went up to the second floor with Akasaka.`
`To be honest, I couldn't even imagine how to start bringing it up.`
`...But even Hanyuu made fun of me.`
` I can't hesitate.`
`I made up my mind and walked into the room... and was surprised.`
`My messy room is all cleaned up.`
`Satoko is packing her pajamas and towels into her duffle bag.`
` It's as if she's going on a camping trip.`
`"Satoko...?`
` I'm home."`
`"Here, I got your luggage ready too!`
` We can't just borrow toothbrushes and towels from Mion-san, you know.`
`Besides, we can't let some strange man stay in a messy room either!`
` This is why I always tell you to tidy things up around here!"`
`I blinked in surprise.`
`I don't understand why Satoko already knows what's going on.`
`If she saw me, Irie, and Tomitake talking behind the shrine with Ooishi and a strange man, she'd be sure to get curious.`
`Satoko must have overheard our conversation.`
`Not only that, she packed our luggage and cleaned our room, which means she already knows Akasaka is going to stay in this house.`
`She must have come home in a hurry to get things done.`
`"......So it wasn't just a storyline for some comic, was it?"`
`"...Meep."`
`"You know, that's what I don't like about you, Rika."`
`"........."`
`"Have I ever doubted you before?`
` I always thought that I was your best friend, that you would count on me before anyone else."`
`"...I am sorry."`
`Satoko doesn't seem that angry.`
`Rather, she seems shocked that what we talked about at school is real. She isn't really that upset.`
`But this is exactly what Hanyuu said.`
`I thought Satoko was my best friend,`
` yet I couldn't trust her completely.`
`Having realized this, I apologized.`
`Satoko turned around as if to tell me there's no time for apologies.`
` I think she accepted it.`
`As the proof of that, she's getting things ready to go to Mion's house.`
` Thank you, Satoko.`
`"Umm, Akasaka-san, is it?`
` I don't know how you and Rika know each other, but if you're Rika's ally, then you're mine too.`
` You may call me Satoko Houjou!"`
`"Nice to meet you.`
` I'm Akasaka.`
` The conspiracy surrounding Rika-chan runs pretty deep, and it's not easy to explain. `
`She was afraid you'd reject her after she confessed to everyone, so please try to understand how she felt too."`
`"Of course I understand!`
` I'm Rika's best friend, you know.`
` She was thinking that I didn't believe her, who would?`
` I can understand why she'd be afraid."`
`"...You're really mature, Satoko-chan.`
` Rika-chan is lucky to have you as her best friend. I'm pretty envious of her."`
`Satoko took Akasaka around the house and explained everything.`
`She let him know that the switch for the hot water heater sticks a little and that if the picture on the TV gets messed up, he needs to tap on it.`
`She even told him about all the traps she set around the shrine, using a secret map of hers.`
`...Akasaka listened to her dead seriously.`
`Upon seeing them talk, I couldn't help but smile.`
`Hanyuu also smiled while watching us...`
`but it felt like she was saying "I told you so".`
`I'm going to pretend that I don't notice her.`
`"...If our contrarian Satoko believed me this easily, then...`
` ...our simple-minded Mion will believe us even more easily. `
`Keiichi doesn't even know how to doubt people and Rena has sharp instincts, so she'll believe me too.`
` So everyone is going to believe me, huh?"`
`Hanyuu didn't reply, but she smiled as if she's happy to see that I grew a little.`
`"Alright, there're plenty of things in the refrigerator.`
` Rika!`
` You're asking him to house-sit,`
` so why don't you make dinner for him tonight?`
` Besides, just to be safe, `
`perhaps we should go over to Mion-san's house a little later."`
`"Oh, don't worry.`
` I can handle that myself."`
`"...Au au, this is a chance to serve him your homemade food, Rika. Au au au☆."`
`"Y-You really are annoying today!`
`Oh right, Satoko, we have to make something good, huh?`
` I have an idea. Can you bring out the large kimchi bottle from the refrigerator? `
`No, not that one. The one that says 'death penalty', not the one that says 'punishment'.`
` Let's make kimchi fried rice today.`
` Akasaka, do you like spicy food?"`
`"Oh, yes!`
` I love spicy things!"`
`"Au!!`
` Au au au au au au au au!!"`
`"The cream puffs in the refrigerator have expired, so let's throw them away.`
` Ahh, what a waste.`
` I heard they're from a famous shop over in Gogura..."`
`"Au au au au au au auuu!!!!"`
`"...The 'au aus' are awfully loud today.`
` Maybe a stray dog's howling somewhere!"`
`Night is falling on the 16th of June.`
`The pieces are lining up on the final game board one after another.`
`No.`
` "Pieces" isn't the right word to call them.`
`Night is falling on the 16th of June.`
`We're gaining reliable allies for this final challenge.`
`Our first key, Tomitake, will be killed in three days.`
`Fate is going to change before that point.`
