`In order for Keiichi Maebara to become a game piece that can lead everyone, there's something he has to learn about first.`
` The piece that's very painful, pitiful, and sad.`
`He has to learn about his friends and he has to learn to not doubt them.`
`He doesn't know the importance of trusting his friends.`
` He doesn't know,`
` just yet.`
`A slight mistrust grows into paranoia, and Keiichi Maebara is trapped within Rule X.`
`At the end of Rule X,`
` Keiichi leaves a sad note,`
` and dies.`
`While it may be very bitter, and very painful,`
` it also puts him through the process of learning something very important.`
`...Hey, Hanyuu.`
`You didn't have to apologize.`
`In the few days he left Hinamizawa to attend his relative's funeral...`
`Tragically, he experienced an outbreak.`
`But I think this was necessary, as his first step towards learning something important.`
`The very first step towards smoking out Rule X, and eventually defeating it.`
`When this piece was all I had, I didn't even think of that, though...`
