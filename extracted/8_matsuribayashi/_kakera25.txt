`......It happened so suddenly.`
`Uncle Koizumi passed away.`
`I never heard he was ill or wasn't feeling well.`
`His chest started to hurt suddenly, and he couldn't sleep.`
`He called an ambulance for the first time in his life because he didn't think he could endure the pain.`
`He was taken into emergency care, but he didn't live to see morning.`
`It was an acute myocardial infarction.`
`......But maybe it was the best possible way to go.`
`Instead of being in bed for many years slowly dilapidating and withering away, he was healthy until his death, so I think he must have lived a wonderful life.`
`But still... it was too sudden.`
`I wish I had called him 'Uncle' more.`
`It's too late though.`
`......Uncle Koizumi would never smile at me again with his wrinkly old face, no matter how many times I called for him.`
`......He was my guardian until now.`
`He always looked after me, making sure my efforts received proper recognition.`
`Maybe he only did that because he couldn't help my grandfather when he was alive.`
` But still, he was an important person to me.`
` He wasn't just my political backing.`
`But, I didn't realize that when he was alive.`
`I only thought of using his power for my own agenda.`
`But after he died, I realized.`
`Uncle Koizumi was my grandpa too.`
`He provided the warmth and protection that I longed for from my own grandfather.`
`At his funeral, I shed tears that I thought that I forgot how to.`
`"...Uncle...`
` Thank you for everything...`
` I should have called you Uncle more, huh?`
` .......Oooh..."`
`No matter how many times I called to him, he would never reply.`
`What I can do for him at this point is complete my research.`
`I must accomplish my goal for his sake.`
`When my grandfather's research is finally acknowledged, Uncle Koizumi's name will be known once again for being the sole supporter of his endeavor.`
`I believe that's the best way to repay him for everything he has done.`
`I vow to devote myself to my work even more from this day on...`
`But...`
` unfortunately...`
` ...hardships and sadness tend to come together.`
`It was like... the tailwind that blew steadily until today...`
` suddenly became a headwind.`
`...The winds shifted far too suddenly.`
` So strong,`
` so cold,`
` so sad.`
`"......What?`
` What are you talking about, Jirou-san?"`
`"...Well,`
` you know that Koizumi-sensei was the main political sponsor for the Irie Insitute, right? ...He had trouble getting approval from the related agencies, but Koizumi-sensei used his political weight to force it through. `
`...After all, he was one of the key figures in the post-war restoration, accomplishing tremendous deeds in the medical industry.`
` He held a huge influence in politics and industry."`
`"So now that Koizumi-sensei is gone, the way he did things won't work any longer?"`
`"So far, it's only a rumor, so I don't know for sure.`
` But I heard they're going to reconsider the budget allocated for the project."`
`"...Are you saying the Irie Institute will be closed down?"`
`"No, I haven't heard anything about them reconsidering the Institute. ...But since Koizumi-sensei's death, the rumors say that there's a great deal of confusion among the old guard and their factions as well as the civil strife within the party around finding his successor. `
`It seems the opposing factions are gaining influence in the human resources of our client.`
` So they may begin to dig deep into the holy treasure chest that the Koizumi faction held to fund their project. `
`Of course, this is all too complicated for me to explain that well`
` and besides, these might just be rumors."`
`Jirou-san kept saying they were rumors, `
`but that told me the wind's direction has changed.`
`Or maybe... Jirou-san already knows everything, and is simply trying to warn me about it.`
`And then, at our next routine audit.`
`Jirou-san made it clear with his own mouth.`
`High-ranking government officials, who had never came here before, attended the routine audit along with Jirou-san.`
`Just by seeing those faces, I can tell the turning point is approaching.`
`"As you know, the Alphabet Project was created to strengthen post-war Japan's presence in the world with the view of developing deterrent weaponry.`
` However, the 21st century is now just around the corner.`
`In this day and age, we must put the past behind us, and start looking forward to a new world."`
`He meant exactly what he said.`
`Japan has already put the past behind.`
`And it's cutting off its ties to the ghosts that wished to resurrect the militaristic might of the pre-war era.`
`"It's been forty years since the end of the war, and we've contributed to the world in various peaceful ways. We have a strong alliance with the United States, and our nation has established its position in world affairs well enough.`
`We have kept our promise to forever renounce war and nuclear weapons, and we are known as a nation of peace. In this coming century, our presence and influence will grow even larger."`
`The Alphabet Project, the main sponsor of the Irie Institute, are a group of people who want to develop a weapon that would act as a deterrent to the nuclear weapons which Japan is forbidden to own.`
`...So they've come to the Irie Institute, one of its branch organizations, to tell us Japan has now renounced nuclear arms...`
` so the Irie Institute will be facing a strong, cold headwind from now on.`
`The roll of the die that came up with 1 on that stormy day has reappeared.`
`......I won't let the result of a die affect me.`
`The power of my will won't be beaten by some god's roll of the dice...`
`"Therefore, we are going to restructure the Alphabet Project to one that's more suitable for the day and age. This new Alphabet Project will be tasked with figuring out the best way for this country to achieve a larger presence in world affairs, not through militaristic means, `
`but through peaceful measures like international trade and economic development."`
`All of the people who hold tremendous influence in the politics and economy of Japan were born before the war, so naturally they want to regain the glory of pre-war Japan.`
`The very idea that we can win next time if we research the new bomb that defeated us is itself a specter of the war.`
`...No, everyone already realized that.`
`It was just that no one could speak out against the grandstanding elders they owed their gratitude towards.`
`Soon, the old will wither away and the new generation will take control.`
`Uncle Koizumi was, in a way, the last remaining pillar for the old generation.`
`His death is a chance for the new generation to step in.`
`The things they couldn't argue openly are now being discussed.`
`They've pointed out that from the beginning, the Alphabet Project was created for the personal satisfaction of a small group of people, and it's sucked money out of the treasury.`
`And so, the new generation of politicians...`
` have taken over from the old.`
`"Therefore, everything the Alphabet Project was sponsoring will have to be re-reviewed.`
` Of course, the Irie Institute is one of those subsidiaries.`
` We hope that you'll understand and respond amicably."`
`"I understand...`
` We can't do research without our sponsors, after all.`
` We'll give you our full cooperation."`
`Irie responded appropriately, but he's obviously bewildered.`
`The best equipment and staff are being provided to the Irie Institute.`
`In other words, our research requires a huge amount of money.`
`For those with no interest in Hinamizawa Syndrome, they probably won't be able to understand why that much money is being put into the research of disgusting parasites.`
`If they're simply going to revise our budget, that would be fine.`
`...We were receiving more than enough money.`
`That would, naturally, be adjusted.`
`......It hurts, but we can endure.`
`...That's what I thought.`
` ...But if just enduring it was enough, it wouldn't be a 1 on the die.`
`...So, even in that sense`
` ...this is definitely a roll of a die coming up as 1.`
`"Anyway, the new board of directors was inaugurated back in April, and they've outlined their new policies for all projects.`
` For more details, please look through the papers I'll be handing out."`
`His papers were then passed around.`
`He started to go over the details, but I read through quickly so I could learn about their stupid decisions first.`
`"The Irie Institute has made great headway in uncovering the mystery of the Hinamizawa Syndrome, as well as creating a cure for the disease. `
`The board of directors is extremely pleased. We recognize this is due to the unceasing efforts of Director Irie and all the staff of the Irie Institute."`
`"Thank you."`
`Even while he received their congratulations, a tense atmosphere surrounded me and Irie.`
`It's customary to start the conversation in the opposite way you're planning to take it before delving into your main point to convey.`
`If the main issue is something good, then start with something bad.`
` ...Or vice versa.`
`"The Irie Institute had two main intentions.`
` One was to study the disease and hopefully find a cure.`
` The other was to research the possibility of utilizing the disease for military applications. `
`The new board of directors has decided to put a stop to the latter immediately.`
` In this day and age, researching biological weapons is an Achilles' heel for Japan. `
`The Irie Institution must cease all related research and destroy any results."`
`"I understand.`
` I will comply."`
`Irie replied with that immediately.`
`Irie was assertive about finding a cure, but was never even remotely interested in researching the disease's use for military purposes.`
`So I'm sure he has no qualms about concurring with such demands.`
`But I don't agree.`
`Because our research will be more limited if we're just trying to find a cure.`
`...To me, finding that cure is simply a by-product of my larger goal of discovering everything about the syndrome.`
`"Also, regarding the Irie Institution, we have decided to have you wrap up your work within the next three years.`
` Your budget will decrease gradually as well."`
`"W-Wait, please...!`
` We've only recently figured out anything about the syndrome, and there's more we have to learn in order to create a better cure. `
`We're making progress, but I can't guarantee we'll come up with a complete cure within three years."`
`"It's the understanding of the board that the Irie Institute has already completed enough research to develop a cure. The Irie Institute has already completed the C117 vaccine, and has a great deal of clinical data--"`
`"No, it's not even close to being completed!!`
` It's still only a prototype, and we we're far from being able to see a cure for all the villagers! `
`Debating the end of our research at this stage can only be described as absolutely, positively reckless!"`
`I'm surprised that Irie objected.`
`Thanks to him, I didn't have to say anything.`
`...But if Irie hadn't objected, I'm sure I would have shrieked in protest.`
`"In other words, the Irie Institute is not yet capable of curing all the people who are infected or to fully eradicate the syndrome, is that correct?"`
`"Yes.`
` Of course, curing all the villagers and eradicating the syndrome will be possible in the future, and that's our ultimate goal.`
` But I need more time, and of course, funding to do that. `
`Our job is to investigate, find a practice that works, and establish it as a product. This isn't a job where you can follow a blueprint to create something with certainty in a set time frame. So we hope that you'll avoid following that misconception."`
`I guess Irie speaks out when he needs to.`
`And what he's saying is absolutely right.`
`Research isn't something guaranteed to produce results with money and time.`
`...But I disagree with some of the things he said.`
`He's objecting about the time and the money, but he's basically agreeing to limit our research only towards finding a cure for Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`That won't do.`
` We won't unravel any mysteries that way.`
` At that rate, the discovery of the Hinamizawa Syndrome won't be recognized as my grandfather's great achievement!`
`"I see. I think I see your point.`
` Our main purpose here is to dispose of the fact that this research was conducted for military purposes. `
`So we must forever hide the fact that research was conducted on the strange disease called Hinamizawa Syndrome, as well as hide its existence. `
`If you can eradicate the disease without anyone ever learning about it, then we will give you the time and funding you require.`
` ...But we'll discuss more about that later. Is that acceptable?"`
`"Yes.`
` I have no problem with that."`
`"Then, please submit a plan and a budget proposal for eradicating the syndrome in secrecy.`
` We'll do our best on our part to approve your proposal."`
`"Thank you.`
` I'll work on it immediately."`
`"Please don't misunderstand that it's our intention to halt that research immediately. We want to see the best possible outcome for your work.`
` Please understand that."`
`"Yes, of course, I understand."`
`......While I was listening to their conversation, I was struck dumbfounded with something they said.`
`Eradicating the syndrome in secrecy.`
`In other words, it would be as though Hinamizawa Syndrome never existed.`
`...So my grandfather's name will never be revered by anyone...`
`The sound of rustling papers and hushed proceedings filled the meeting room, but I only heard the ticking clock as I clutched my sweating palms.`
