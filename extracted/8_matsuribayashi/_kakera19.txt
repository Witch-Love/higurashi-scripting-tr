`The lights came on in the meeting room as the slideshow ended, and all the auditors began to applaud, praising the Irie Institution's dramatic accomplishments.`
`"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!!`
` To be honest with you, I wasn't expecting too much from this Hinamizawa Syndrome research."`
`"I figured that even if there was progress, it would be three steps forward and two steps back every decade."`
`"Oh my!`
` How impressive it is to achieve so much in such a short period of time!`
` This is all thanks to you, Director Irie!!"`
`"Oh, no.`
` This is all because of the staff that supported me, and Takano-san too."`
`"Don't be so humble.`
` Hee hee hee.`
` Director Irie is a genius in the field of neurology.`
` After all, he's also produced greater achievements than any other doctor when it comes to the brain."`
`"That's true!`
` Not many doctors as young as you have nearly as much experience operating on brains."`
`"Congratulations, Lieutenant Colonel Irie!`
` Now I can go back to Tokyo with my head held high."`
`"I'm honored we gave you something good to take back with you, Tomitake-san.`
` By the way, could you please stop calling me Lieutenant Colonel? I just can't get used to it... `
`I almost prefer 'Risa-san' at this point."`
`"Ah ha ha ha!`
` I bet you do, huh?"`
`"Hee hee.`
` You sure were a huge help.`
` You're the one who secured funding for our research, even when we couldn't produce feasible results. We couldn't have done this without you."`
`"It wasn't any trouble... ha ha ha ha...!`
` But really, the results you've presented today are just brilliant! `
`Not only have you found the cause of the syndrome, you've also provided a clear path towards future research.`
` We're looking forward to hearing more progress when we come again next time."`
`"I'm sure the Tokyo office will quit bothering us about cutting your budget with these sorts of results."`
`"Hee hee.`
` After all, we nearly lost our budget for the canned coffee we provided to you all, didn't we?"`
`"""Bwaaa ha ha ha ha ha!!!"""`
`"Tomitake-kun, make sure you report our progress to Tokyo well enough that they give us enough funding to hold a party!"`
`"We've been getting nothing but the stick, it's time for the carrot!"`
`"Hahahaha, we'll be happiest if that carrot comes back in the shape of funding."`
`"""Waa ha ha ha ha ha!!!"""`
`And with that congenial atmosphere, our routine audit was over.`
`Irie was surrounded and being questioned by National Institute of Infectious Diseases workers who had joined the auditors.`
`"Takano-san, congratulations!`
`I can't really say this out loud, but all the progress I've seen tonight is thanks to your hard work."`
`"Hee hee.`
` Thank you, Jirou-san."`
`Jirou-san and I are the only ones here who know that strings were pulled in order to create the Irie Institute.`
`...So only Jirou-san can understand what I had to go through.`
`"But I've only just risen to the stage for my research.`
` My opponent and I are finally in the same arena, that's all.`
` The critical fight comes after this.`
` And it should be getting even more exciting in the future."`
`"Aha ha ha.`
` By the way, Manager Nakagawa told me to tell you that he wants you to hold a presentation in Tokyo.`
` Even the Alphabet board wants you to come meet with them. `
`I guess they all want to hear this directly from you."`
`"Oh my, isn't having you explain enough?"`
`"Nah, ah ha ha ha!`
` I-I don't think that's what they mean...!`
` I-I bet they want to meet such a pretty researcher in person, maybe, ah ha ha ha...!"`
`"My my, aren't you being silly, Jirou-san?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Major Takano, there's a phone call for you from Tokyo."`
`"Thank you for holding,`
` this is Takano."`
`"Heeey, how are you doing?"`
`"K-Koizumi-sensei!!`
` Thank you for taking time to call me..."`
`"Wa ha ha ha!`
` You know, I heard you made a significant breakthrough, Miyo-chan,`
` so I had to call to congratulate you!"`
`"Thank you very much!!`
` Yes, thanks to your support, we've been able to accomplish the first step of identifying the microbe that causes Hinamizawa Syndrome."`
`"Mmm-hmm,`
` I see, I see!!`
` Great job, Miyo-chan!`
` I'm sure Takano-kun is very happy in Heaven right now!!"`
`"That's a little too early to say.`
` My grandfather was attempting to go beyond merely identifying the cause of the syndrome. `
`His work was about showing the possibility of human thoughts actually being controlled by parasitic agents in our bodies.`
` ...Only when that is proven will his research be recognized for the great achievement it is. `
`Hee hee.`
` When we're able to explain all thoughts and religions with parasites,`
` heehee, the world is going to be tossed into chaos."`
`"Wa ha ha ha ha. How interesting!!`
` I can just imagine how those religious big shots will react once they find out that their leaders are parasites!! How interesting!`
` I would love to see that. `
`I won't die until you show that to me, Miyo-chan."`
`"Please don't say that.`
` Do look forward to it, though.`
` I'll make sure that this research will spread shock throughout the world. `
`Then the whole world will finally realize how great my grandfather was, and they'll be fighting each other to read over the documents he left behind.`
` Only then can I say that I've repaid my debt to him."`
`"...I'm a little envious of Takano-kun~.`
` I don't want money, you know.`
` I don't mind getting rid of half of what I have.`
` I just wish I had a grandchild who would carry on my legacy."`
`"Thank you so much.`
` Those words mean so much to me."`
`"By the way, I sent you a present.`
` It's a nice bottle of wine for you to celebrate with.`
` I didn't know your address, so I sent it to the clinic. `
`However, they told me they're having a difficult time importing it, so it may take a little while. But when it comes, please have a party with the people who helped you."`
`"Celebratory wine?`
` Well then, I wonder what expensive sort of drink Koizumi-sensei'll be sending us!"`
`"Oh, it's not that kind of expensive.`
` Don't you remember, Miyo-chan?`
` Takano-kun used to keep a particular bottle of wine."`
`...I remember...`
`That's right. My grandfather kept a certain bottle of wine.`
`I don't know if he bought it himself or if someone gave it to him,`
` but he treasured it, and he always said he'd open it when his research finally gained recognition.`
`I was a child then, so I don't even remember what brand it was, but Mr. Koizumi would know.`
`He went through all the trouble to find the same bottle of wine for this special occasion.`
`...For the first time in a while, Takano felt the same sunny warmth she experienced during her time with her grandfather.`
`"Thank you very much...`
` ...Uncle Koizumi..."`
`"Hmmmm.`
` I like it when you call me that, Miyo-chan!!`
` I don't feel like you're speaking to me when you say 'Koizumi-sensei'.`
` Wa ha ha ha!!"`
`I can't help but smile along with him...`
`Because I think Tomitake and Irie were just having a similar exchange.`
`"If you like it that way, then I'll be happy to call you that when there's nobody around.`
` Hee hee."`
`"Hmm, I'll be happier if you'd call me that even in front of people!`
` Wa ha ha ha."`
`I don't know exactly how old he is.`
` But if he can laugh so energetically, he'll live for many more years to come.`
`...I guess the saying about living a long life is true after all.`
`"Takano-kun and I both wished you were truly part of our family.`
` We really did..."`
`...My grandfather had his own family, of course.`
`But because he was so into his research, he became estranged from his wife. They were legally married, but they lived separately.`
`I never met his family when I was a child.`
` I only met them... after my grandfather committed suicide.`
`During his latter years, my grandfather went into psychological despair, and began to look at his life with cynicism.`
`His condition became worse over time, and he was shocked at his own dementia. He was afraid of living while his consciousness degraded.`
`So... he jumped off the rooftop of the hospital.`
`Only my name was in his suicide note.`
`None of his family members' names were in it.`
`That's when all his relatives showed up and took everything my grandfather left behind.`
`They were afraid I was going to get his estate.`
`They had lawyers and all that, so I backed down.`
`I asked for everything in his study in return.`
`Those idiots don't understand the value of my grandfather's research.`
`They were actually happy to strike a deal out of court, and they could also get rid of the piles of papers and jars with human organs in them.`
`They never even showed up once when he was alive, yet, like hyenas, they appeared after his death. I'd never let them put their hands all over my grandfather's research.`
`Fortunately, I was able to protect my grandfather's soul from their tainted hands.`
`"Hmm.`
` Okay, I'll get going here.`
` If there's anything you need, be sure to call Uncle Koizumi, okay?`
` I'll do anything for my granddaughter!!"`
`"Thank you, Uncle Koizumi.`
` I'll work even harder!!"`
