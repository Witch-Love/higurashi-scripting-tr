`During the family council, she buried herself under Oryou-san's futon again.`
`...Oryou-san dotes on her unwaveringly.`
`No matter whatever insolence my child commits, she doesn't mind.`
`It's almost as though my child is a kitten or something.`
` ...Oryou dotes on her exactly like you would with a kitten.`
`As her mother, I chided her for doing that.`
`Until Oryou-san had said three times that it was fine, I chided her as a formality.`
`Of course she never lends an ear to any of my chidings.`
`...Knowing that Oryou-san's standing was far above mine, she behaves like that.`
`I don't like the cunning that's unbefitting of her age either.`
`In any case, not only Oryou-san, but the rest of the old folk in the village spoil her too much.`
`One day, I was surprised.`
`By chance, on the way back from some shopping, I saw her by herself just outside a candy shop.`
`My own child suddenly grabbed a snack, opened the package right there and then started eating it.`
`She didn't make any attempt to pay for it, and she didn't even think of looking around.`
`It didn't even feel like she was shoplifting... more like she were brazenly eating snacks that was offered to her.`
`When I began to admonish my child, the elderly shop owner appeared and covered for her.`
`The owner gave the ridiculous excuse that he had said it was okay for that child to eat any of the snacks out by the entrance, so it was fine.`
`When I tried to pay for the snacks that my child had eaten, the owner refused my money.`
`During that exchange, more old folks had suddenly gathered around, and it began to feel like I was the one in the wrong.`
`The elderly people all put their hands together reverently in front of my child and repeatedly voiced their respects.`
`...I was born into the Furude family, so it wasn't like I didn't know why she was being treated specially.`
`When I was still young.`
` It was something I heard often from my grandmother.`
`If by chance the child that I gave birth to was a girl...`
`That child would be the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
`All the older folk believe she's the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama, and spoil her rotten.`
`And not only did they spoil her... but they even told her she was the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama,`
` that she had a divine power, and threw all sorts of strange folktales her way.`
`So she may have begun to believe herself that she was a special existence.`
`I went around and told everybody that it wasn't good for her upbringing, so to stop telling her all these strange things... but there was no uprooting the elderly people's deep-seated superstitions.`
`I told my child not to listen to them, but it ended up being that she stopped listening to me.`
`Between all the old folks in the village who would dote on her and myself who only scolded her, there was no wonder who she would listen to.`
`...There was no mistaking that the reason she had become strange was because of the elderly villagers.`
`There was no doubt that they had shoved her full of strange folk tales and superstitions since she was young.`
`If it wasn't for that, there was no doubt my child would have been cute and normal!`
