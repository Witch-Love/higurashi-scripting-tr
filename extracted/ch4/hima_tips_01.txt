`"...Oh really?`
` It's tough when it's such a sudden assignment...`
` Please be careful.`
` Where are you headed?`
` You're already there?"`
`"..."`
`Whenever I headed out on assignment, she would ask where.`
`...Not just Yukie, but anybody would have asked the same question.`
`If it was a cold place, she would urge me to pack a thick jacket.`
`If it was far, she'd warn me to be careful on the drive over.`
`...It was just normal everyday concern that led to asking such an obvious thing.`
`I felt sad that I couldn't answer such a run-of-the-mill question.`
`"...Sorry.`
` It's something that you can't talk about, isn't it...`
` Please be careful."`
`"...Sorry, Yukie."`
`"...At some point, you started apologizing right away.`
` Even though when you first started your job you were all gung-ho about it.`
` ...Hee hee."`
`Yukie laughed as though she had realized something.`
`At times like this, Yukie had the magical power to see right through me.`
`"...It's already been quite a while since I was admitted to the hospital.`
` Are you finally getting lonely?"`
`"D-Don't tease me.`
` I'm too old to get lonely..."`
`"...Hee hee. Oh really?`
` You actually like to be doted on, don't you...?`
` Don't you start getting a little faint of heart when I'm not around?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`"...Aww, geez...`
` I can see the little devil horns sprouting from your head right now...`
` You've always been like this."`
`"...You can't hide it, you can't hide it.`
` If I don't play with you, you get aaaallll lonely.`
` I can hear your tail wagging over the phone.`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`This side of Yukie wasn't something you could guess existed from seeing her usual modest behavior, and it was something that she didn't show to anybody else but me.`
`Normally I'd poke her to hide my embarrassment and bring an end to the conversation, but I couldn't do that over the phone.`
`...Of course, Yukie was clever.`
` She was teasing me because of that.`
`"...Hee hee hee.`
` I wonder when I figured out that giving you grief was this much fun..."`
`"Give me a break...`
` ...In any case, it's good to hear you so lively."`
`"...I know, right?`
` ...Did I cheer you up?"`
`I had called Yukie to keep her from feeling lonely when she was by herself in the hospital room.`
`...Of course that was nothing more than a pretense that I, being shy, had come up with.`
` It seemed that Yukie had long since seen through that act.`
`"...Yeah."`
`"Please phone again...`
` When I'm not feeling up to it, I'll get my father to talk with you. `
`...Although, if you're talking with my father, I get the feeling that you'd be standing at attention on the other side of the line.`
` Hee hee hee."`
`For a while longer, Yukie kept teasing me without letting me end the call...`
