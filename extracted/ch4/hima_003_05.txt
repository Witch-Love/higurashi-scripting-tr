`"...The person who was running around cutting all the phone cords was you, wasn't it, Rika-chan?`
` You shouldn't do that any more."`
`"...I'm not sure what you're talking about."`
`"Really...?"`
`She tried to play dumb, but it was written all over her face.`
`"Nipaa~~...â˜†"`
`It was obvious she was trying to laugh it off, but that adorable smile of hers just made me want to forgive her.`
`...Ahhh... I'm going to be a horrible father, aren't I.`
`That momentary lapse in tension was erased by her next words.`
`"It's good that they found the grandson safe and sound."`
`Unable to respond right away, I sunk into silence.`
`...I had already learned this from Sato-san's info, didn't I.`
`This girl... no--this entire village, knew everything since the moment I set foot in it.`
`I considered playing dumb.`
`But in the end, I chose not to.`
`With everything being known already, there was no point in me feigning ignorance.`
`"...Somehow."`
`"That's great.`
` ...Now you can go back to Tokyo."`
`"...Thank you."`
`"...Are your injuries bad, Akasaka?"`
`"Dunno... I haven't heard anything from the doctor yet, so I don't know if they are or not."`
`Huh?`
` Come to think of it, I vaguely remembered being told to lie down and take it easy for at least 24 hours.`
`...Did that mean bed rest?`
`"...The wounded shouldn't be sneaking out of the hospital."`
`"People shouldn't be cutting phone cords."`
`"...Meep.`
` I have no idea what you're talking about."`
`"Then I don't know what you're talking about either."`
`As we played dumb with each other, we both laughed at the same time.`
`If somebody saw us laughing at each other like this, it would probably bring a smile to their lips.`
`"...The chances of Akasaka leaving this village alive weren't very high."`
`"..."`
`"...I don't want Akasaka to die, so I'm glad you're leaving the village alive."`
`"Rika-chan.`
` ...You knew who I was... right from the beginning, didn't you?"`
`She said nothing, but gave a firm nod.`
`"...Well then, I think you know this, but we're probably somewhat of an enemy to the people in this village, I would think.`
` But you still gave me lots of warnings."`
`That's right.`
` She said it at that time.`
`She wouldn't warn somebody that she was okay with dying.`
` ...She definitely said something like that.`
`"Then... I should probably be thanking you."`
`"...You probably should.`
` I'm your savior."`
`Saying that, she puffed up her chest proudly.`
`She said it jokingly, but the meaning behind those words was quite heavy.`
`That was because whether I lived or died was a decision that might have been made in a place unbeknownst to me.`
`She said those words with such an adorable smile that it took a few moments of silence for their weight to settle in.`
`...I'd been to this place before.`
`The Guardians's office was there: it was the stone steps leading up to the Furude Shrine.`
`When I passed by before, I was so focused on finding a phone booth I hadn't realized where I was.`
`"If I recall correctly... this shrine is Rika-chan's house, right?"`
`"...Yeah, something like that."`
`Looking up at the shrine grounds, it was brightly lit and energetic voices could be heard.`
`What was going on?`
`"...There's a festival today."`
`"A festival?"`
`"...The best and only festival in Hinamizawa.`
` ...the Watanagashi festival."`
`"Watanagashi? Cotton... drifting?"`
`"...Just knowing the name is boring.`
` ...Do you want to take a look?"`
`She asked bluntly.`
`...But, seeing that I looked interested, she climbed up a couple of steps and motioned for me to come.`
`...I was only going to go back and sleep anyways.`
`If I had nothing else to do, it might not be a bad idea to go with her on a little detour.`
`...In the hostile territory that was this village, I didn't know what would happen if I ventured down a side road without Ooishi.`
`...Even though I thought of the village like that, when I was with this girl, I forgot all about it.`
`...In any case, even without anything to back it up, I felt that as long as I was with her, none of the ill will from the village would befall me.`
`That's why, even though I knew my cover was blown, I strangely had no qualms about setting foot into the heart of the Onigafuchi Guardians's territory...`
`Climbing up to the grounds of the shrine,`
` I could see there were about 3 pavilions set up, with meeting tables and folding chairs. `
`The old folks from the village (no, the executives of the Guardians?) were already quite drunkenly sharing another round of drinks.`
`I could only see it as people from the village council drinking while enjoying the evening air.`
`At the very least, it was certainly quite different than any festival I'd ever seen.`
`"...See?`
` It's quite a boring festival, isn't it?"`
`"Haha... this certainly doesn't look like a festival."`
`"...It's a festival that's happened since long ago, but as you can see, it's not like it used to be."`
`As if to chide the old folk, she said that while looking at them with an exasperated expression.`
`You really couldn't call this a festival any more.`
`It was just a bunch of neighbors getting together to drink under the guise of a festival.`
`"Haha... I feel sorry for the deity being celebrated here..."`
`"...Give this sorry excuse for a festival 5 or 6 more years, then everybody in the village will start coming...`
` the ceremony will also be done properly, and it'll be a respectable festival again."`
`What she said was not so much wishful thinking as it was the telling of a future that had already been determined.`
`She wasn't even predicting it; it was almost like she was simply reporting the results.`
` That's how it sounded.`
`Even though it was baseless speculation, the way she said it wouldn't let me interject.`
`It was the same way she talked when she 'changed.'`
`While I struggled to find the words to reply to her, she wandered over to the other side of the grounds, not minding me at all.`
`Not in a state where I could afford to be left behind, I hurriedly followed after her.`
`Passing through a copse of pine trees, a strong and cool breeze ruffled my hair.`
`...There, from that one evening, was the splendid observation platform the girl had shown me.`
`As it had grown completely dark, the modest lights littered across the nightscape were providing a different type of scenery.`
`"...Looking at it like this, this village seems tranquil."`
`She said that with an indifferent look on her face.`
`"Just the other day,`
` ...you said that this village definitely wouldn't be submerged by the dam... didn't you?"`
`She didn't reply, seemingly relishing in the feeling of the wind blowing through her hair.`
`"Didn't that mean... at that point in time, the Minister had already complied with the demands?"`
`"..."`
`She spun around, her gaze meeting mine.`
`But she said nothing.`
`She spoke nothing that would neither confirm nor deny what I had just said.`
`"This case... will probably remain shrouded in darkness.`
` ...Headquarters probably doesn't want trouble from a scandal with the Minister breaking out."`
`"...There's no mistake that they threatened to kill the grandchild."`
`"Then, negotiations with the Minister were successful... and the grandson was released."`
`"...The one who saved the grandson was you."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` ...The discovery of that wallet that started this chain of events...`
` that alone was almost too convenient, I'd think."`
`...Ever since the moment that wallet was discovered, I felt something was odd.`
`Ooishi said it as well.`
`That the Sonozaki family had given the order to release the hostage.`
`Meaning... that our little manhunt was a farce to begin with.`
`...Come to think of it, I was punched, kicked, and had a gun pointed at me.`
`I felt like they put up quite a fight, but that might have been all part of a good performance.`
`Once the negotiations were successful, they couldn't just say "here you go" and return the Minister's grandson right to his doorstep.`
`They knew that Public Safety had realized that this was a kidnapping case and were moving in on it.`
`That's why, due to the actions of Public Safety, the grandson was able to be rescued safely.`
`So the Minister didn't give in to any unreasonable demands.`
` ...That type of performance was necessary.`
`"...I don't know about these difficult things."`
`"...Likewise.`
` Even for me, I can't make much sense of it.`
` But, there's one thing I can be certain of."`
`"...?"`
`"It's just as you said.`
` ...This village won't be submerged.`
` The dam project will soon be over."`
`That wasn't something an officer of the law should be saying.`
`But, I naturally let those words slip from my mouth.`
`This village may have stirred up all sorts of trouble.`
`But, that was because they were protecting their homes.`
`If someone just decided by themselves that I had to leave the house I was used to living in, I would resent them as well.`
`On top of that, it wasn't a place like mine where I just happened to be renting it, but a place that their families had lived for generations.`
`It might be ignorant to call their desperate resistance an overreaction.`
`I might not really be qualified to criticize politics or bureaucracy...`
`But, deliberately building a dam on land that was loved by its residents wasn't something I could get behind.`
`"Still, aren't you glad?"`
`"Why would that be?"`
`"At the very least.. with this, peace will return to this village."`
`Even though the Minister promised to use his considerable influence to cancel the project, it would probably take more than a few months before it would be completely scrapped.`
`At the very least... it would probably take one or two years.`
`For the villagers to officially hear that their village wasn't going to be submerged at the bottom of a dam was still a ways away.`
`But... it was no mistake that the promise of peace returning to the village was there.`
`It turned out, from beginning to end, that it had already all been decided.`
`Just as the girl had said, it was decided.`
`There wasn't really a need for me to come here in the first place.`
`There was absolutely no need for me to have come here and aggravate an unpleasant situation.`
`If I had never come here, then...`
`The grandson's release might have been done in a more amicable manner.`
`"...Peace?`
` In this village?"`
`When I nodded, she laughed as if to admonish me.`
`But her face remained indifferent, expressionless.`
`And then, her eyes narrowed slightly as she snickered.`
`"...Even though every year from now on, something bloody will occur?`
` ...Tee hee hee hee."`
`"Rika-chan,`
` what are you talking about?"`
`As the wind blew her hair about, the girl, as if taking pleasure in that I was the only one who didn't know...`
` continued to snicker as she looked at my face for a while.`
`"You see...`
` in a few years...`
` I'll be killed."`
`Huh...?`
`Backlit by the moon, It was hard to tell if her expression that had been cast in shadow was smiling, amused...`
` or resigned.`
`"...You will?`
` ...Why?"`
`"...It's a very unpleasant thing, though.`
` ...It's also probably been decided already."`
`"Decided already? Who would decide that sort of thing!?"`
`"I'd like to know that as well."`
`Turning back to face me, she showed me a resolute expression for the first time...`
`And after staring into my eyes for a moment, she turned back to gaze at the scenery before she spoke her next words.`
`"...There's a lot of people who have no regard for human life.`
` ...Even if I tell you this, it might not change anything, though. `
`But... if you want to erase the specter of death, sometimes, like with the reflection of the moon on the water, all you have to do is throw a small stone."`
`I had no idea what she was trying to say.`
`It's just... I had to listen to every word with my body and soul, or at least, that's what I thought.`
`"...This day next year.`
` ...Yes, June 1979, on this day.`
` The foreman of the dam construction project will be killed."`
`"...What...?"`
`For a moment, I couldn't comprehend what she was talking about.`
`By the foreman... did she mean that gruff old man I played mahjong with?`
`"...B-`
`Be killed...`
` ...What makes you think..."`
`She didn't answer.`
`But she had the same expression on her face as she did when she declared that the dam project would go away.`
`...That wasn't the face of somebody making a forecast or a prediction.`
`...It was something that was already decided,`
` no--`
` it was as if she was already reporting the results... that sort of expression.`
`"...After being killed in a gruesome manner, the body will be torn apart and disposed of."`
`"...Murdered and dismembered..."`
`"...The next year, in June of 1980 on this day.`
` ...Satoko's parents will be pushed to their deaths."`
`...Satoko?`
`It was the first time I heard that name, but I didn't have the courage to interrupt the girl's story.`
`"...It might be an accident.`
` ...An unfortunate accident."`
`The girl smiled faintly... but she wasn't exactly encouraging me to smile along with the lifeless look in her eyes.`
`"And then, the year after that, this day in June of 1981.`
` ...My parents will be killed.`
`And then the year after that, this day in June of 1982.`
` Satoko's abusive aunt will have her head split open and die.`
`And then the year after that, this day in the June of 1983...`
` ...Or possibly a few days afterwards.`
`...I will be killed.`
`If all the deaths are pre-ordained...`
` ...Then the last one would also be all according to plan.`
` ...But then whose plan would it be...?"`
`This village is full of murderers and people who have no regard for human life.`
`It would be fine to believe that all the deaths up to 1982 would be the work of somebody in the village.`
`It would be fine to believe that all the deaths that would occur were at the discretion of those who control the village.`
`But that didn't explain what would happen in 1983.`
`There was no way that the last death would fit in with anybody's plans.`
`They had no regard for human life.`
`They would use every means at their disposal to meet their goals.`
`But their goals were at odds with the last death.`
`That's why the last death was unrelated to them.`
`But that last death would definitely,`
` most likely,`
` probably,`
` without question,`
` happen.`
`Probably, definitely, I dare say.`
`The last death would be a merciful one.`
`A handkerchief or something being placed over their mouth, making them lose consciousness, never to wake up again.`
`Exactly whose plan was that?`
`"...I want to live happily.`
` ...That's my only wish.`
`Surrounded by my precious friends, spending our days enjoyably.`
` ...Only that.`
` I don't wish for anything more than that."`
`"...Rika-chan..."`
`"...I don't want to die."`
`The girl, stoic as ever, let those last words slip in the end.`
`...Eventually, we were discovered by some drunks.`
`The girl, as well as I, were dragged back to the festivities.`
`Everybody was completely drunk, so even when they saw my head completely wrapped in bandages, they wouldn't let me leave.`
`...Well certainly, if I was in good enough condition to slip out of the hospital, it must not be that serious.`
`The girl was mingling with everybody, being pampered like a kitten.`
`Her expression was adorable... nothing like the one from just before,`
` predicting her own death and whispering that she didn't want to die.`
`Having said that...`
`...Having a silly and lively conversation like this, it was hard to believe that these people were the core of an extremist resistance group.`
`Even if it was a shell of its former self, it was a festival where people in the village gathered, so the twenty-some-odd folk here should have included some of the village executives and other important members.`
`...Among those, there was no doubt that there were members that were at the Sonozaki family council in attendance.`
`Meaning, even if we never met face-to-face before, there were people here who knew my identity.`
`In a small village like this, they knew the faces of all the villagers that lived here.`
`That's why, without even saying anything, it soon became obvious that I was an outsider.`
`But they actually seemed interested by that, asking me all sorts of questions about Tokyo, `
`drinking while musing on the faint relationship the city had with the villagers and empathizing with the rather meager environment.`
`The confidential talks with the Minister were finished, his grandson was in police custody... everything was over.`
`I might not have to be put in another perilous situation.`
`To me, they were only my adversaries because of my job.`
` Outside of that, there was no reason I couldn't be friendly with them.`
`...The next time I visited this village...`
`would it return to being a tranquil and beautiful place?`
`If that happened, I might be able to take a relaxed walk around the village with her again.`
`My cup was once again filled to the brim with beer...`
`By the time I was able to get away, it was the middle of the night.`
`The girl had at some point disappeared.`
`It seems that her parents had told her to go home and sleep when she let out a large yawn.`
`The old folks, who had absolutely no remorse for making an injured person hang out with them, told me as much as they laughed.`
`I was just there drinking, so I had thought to help a bit with clean up. However, my help was refused on the grounds that I was a guest.`
`On top of that, they had a car prepared to take me back to the hospital.`
`Losing the battle against my sleepiness inside the car, I was sound asleep until we reached the parking lot of the hospital.`
`The front door of the hospital was naturally locked at this hour.`
`I wandered around bewilderedly searching for a back entrance until somebody on night duty found out and let me inside.`
`"Where were you this late at night?`
` Dr. Irie was worried, you know..."`
`"...Sorry for the trouble.`
` I was held up by the people having a festival at the shrine..."`
`"Oh, they did say something about everybody in the town council getting together for a drink.`
` My condolences.`
` ...Are your wounds all right?"`
`"...They're throbbing a bit.`
` It's probably because of the alcohol, I think."`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` The detective that was with you wanted to get in touch."`
`"...Oops.`
` I kept Ooishi-san waiting..."`
`I glanced at the clock.`
`No matter how you looked at it, it was way too late to call him now.`
` I'll apologize to him tomorrow over the phone...`
`I returned back to my hospital room and slipped into the bed that was still unmade from the time I went outside.`
`...Oh, that's no good.`
` I have to turn off the lights.`
`......But my weariness had cut the cord powering my body, lulling me into a deep sleep.`
