`"...Yeah.`
` Yesterday, when we met at the restaurant in Ginza,`
` that topic popped up."`
`"That's overstepping their boundaries, isn't it?`
` They're meddling too much with Public Safety.`
` If they keep doing that, they're going to set a bad precedent."`
`"It seems that Minister Inukai is openly uncomfortable about the way Public Safety is doing things.`
` The Vice-Minister is probably going to say something to that effect during Monday's debate session. `
`...But what can you do?"`
`"We can only have the Director address the Vice-Minister.`
` That's why we pay him the big bucks."`
`"Well, if it comes to that, they're going to ask him for proof that the Minister's being threatened."`
`"Sometimes I don't know what side he's on.`
` If he's not on ours, then what?"`
`"Well, he's probably getting some pressure from the Minister.`
` We'll probably just have to proceed with the investigation while he sweats it out in the Vice-Minister's office and buys us some time. `
`...He might get so wrung out to dry that all that'll be left are dregs, though.`
` ...So, how's the investigation going?"`
`"All the juicy leads I was pinning my hopes on turned out to be duds. Honestly, I'm at a loss."`
`"There are reports that the Hinamizawa Dam Project has been showing up a lot lately in the Minister's press releases, so what about that?"`
`"....Hmmm...`
` Well you say 'showing up,' but it's really more of a very slight feeling that something's strange. `
`He just happened to mention it during his speech at the XX Prefectural Forum, so it just might have been something that he was mentioning because it was relevant at the time."`
`"If I remember correctly, a local organization there was protesting quite violently, no?`
` The Onigafuchi Guardians.`
` I think Akasaka-kun was investigating that."`
`"I think those guys could possibly be behind what's happening now.`
` Even if we can't say there's anything overtly suspicious about them, it might not be prudent to remove them from the picture... `
`Akasaka-kun reported in passing that he couldn't deny that possibility."`
`"...Then, isn't there merit in investigating them?`
` We're going through everything with a fine-toothed comb, so if they're one of the suspicious groups that're left, we'll eventually have to."`
`"Well, they're not the only group we should investigate, right?`
` Ahahaha!`
`If we're just talking about groups that are as suspicious as Onigafuchi, there's quite a few of them.`
` We don't have the men, the time, or the money for it all."`
`"I'll try asking for more details from Akasaka-kun.`
` ...I feel like we should pay some extra attention to this Guardians."`
`"He's reported that he's established a rapport with the villagers.`
` It also seems that he's collaborating with the local police."`
`"Keep your contact with Akasaka-kun on the down-low.`
` Also, if there's anything in his info that merits investigation, it's possible we can send reinforcements."`
`"Got it.`
` ...Ah, sorry... Chief Kataoka~!`
` There's a phone call from the Director.`
` Should I transfer it over here?"`
`"Ah, no, it's okay!`
` I'll head over there.`
` ...Yes hello?"`
