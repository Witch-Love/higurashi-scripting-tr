`I don't know what to say.`
`I want to say something, but I can't think of the right words. I can only sigh.`
`"Ah, Ooishi-san!`
` I've been looking for you!!`
` The section manager asked me about the wanted poster..."`
`"Be quiet!`
` This is a place of rest."`
`As Kumagai barged into the room, the old coroner quickly snapped back at him.`
`"S...`
` Sorry.`
` Umm, the section manager asked me about the wanted poster for the suspect."`
`"...Ah...`
` can you talk to Komiyama-kun about that?`
` I need to speak to the coroner here.`
` Could you tell him I'll be right over?"`
`"Eh...`
` o-okay!!"`
`Kumagai ran out of the autopsy room with the same haste he entered in.`
`"Lively, isn't he?"`
`"The old man would've slapped him for making such a fuss."`
`"You probably should go back too.`
` The air in here isn't for people who aren't used to it."`
`"You're right.`
` If I slack off too long, I might get slapped as well."`
`"...Ha ha ha ha.`
` Here in Shishibone, all the hoodlums crossed the street when you passed through, yet he's the only one, past or future, who's ever punched you for splitting your tsumo wrong..."`
`"He really was a merciless man...`
` I think he punched me more than my real father."`
`"Doesn't matter if he was your real one or not.`
` If you looked up to him in the same way, then he really was a father to you."`
`"............"`
`My real father passed away in Nagoya.`
`...He was unlucky.`
`If he wasn't given the order to move to a plant in Nagoya, he wouldn't have died in an air raid.`
`...If he could have rode it out another half a year or so, then the war would have been over.`
`I was sad, of course, but I was grown up enough by then that I didn't cry into the ground like my mother did.`
`But... people feel sadness in different ways.`
`For some people, it comes all at once as an overwhelming wave, but others feel sadness gradually, over a long period of time.`
` I think I was the latter.`
`When he was alive, I only thought of him as annoying. In my mind, I even cursed him with questions about why he avoided the draft.`
`And I thought my feelings towards him would always be the same.`
`Then the war ended.`
`As I saw families and friends being reunited with joy as they came home from the front,`
` it finally happened.`
`I grieved for my father's death.`
`Japan was filled with people who were sad and full of despair.`
`I knew I wasn't the only one whose life ended up that way.`
`But... I remember I was very, very heartbroken.`
`After the war, the nation completely changed. As a policeman, the environment I worked in went through sudden changes too.`
`In order to forget my sorrow, the only thing I could do was devote myself to my work.`
`"At the time, I was in charge of busting people for buying rice illegally.`
` I conducted spot checks on travelers at major train stations.`
` And boy, did I find a lot of them. `
`There was a fairly big black market in Gogura, and a lot of people came from as far as Osaka to buy it."`
`After the war, Japan faced a chronic shortage in food supply.`
`To those ends, the nation instituted a food rationing program by signing the Food Control Act.`
`But the rations the government provided weren't even close to being enough to feed families. Therefore, people had no choice other than buying food and supplies on the black market.`
`The government hardly had enough food for rations, but there were somehow plenty on the black market.`
`The dealers there sold it at outrageous prices, and some of them became quite wealthy.`
`...The Sonozaki family made their money through that black market, but that's another story.`
`The government didn't bother arresting these dealers.`
`For, with their money, they were able to buy off the top members of the police department.`
`...Instead, they decided to go after the people buying the goods, and even confiscated the rice they bought by selling everything they owned.`
`"Yeah, I remember that...`
` Wasn't there a prosecutor who starved himself to death?"`
`"Yeah, there was.`
` The prosecutor who vowed not to eat illegal rice starved to death... Wasn't it in 1947?`
` That was horrible. `
`He, a public prosecutor, proved it himself that people couldn't survive by adhering to the law."`
`That prosecutor had grown tired of the government charging people with doing whatever they could to survive.`
` And he proclaimed that he was never going to buy black market rice again.`
`In 1947, he starved to death when he was only in his mid-thirties.`
`The law prohibited people from buying black market rice.`
`But that was the only way to survive.`
`In that case, was the Food Control Act a bad law itself?`
`The death of the prosecutor was seen as a desperate message to the government about the unjustness of that law.`
`"...We rounded up people with bags of rice and lined them up at the temporary inspection point next to the station.`
` It was like a military tribunal. `
`We inspected their bags and confiscated everything that they bought at the black market.`
` The women all cried.`
` They sold everything they owned to buy the rice.`
` They pleaded that if we confiscated the rice, `
`how would they feed their starving children?"`
`"Doesn't make sense, huh?`
` Yet they forbade you from going after the sellers. So it was absolutely unfair from the view of the people."`
`"Everyone was on edge.`
` If they heard a police inspection was set up at the next station, they'd jump off the train and run. `
`We were aware of these people, so we set up several officers near jump-off spots in order to capture them.`
` I remember chasing after women carrying several kilos of rice on them."`
`That was when I first met the old man.`
`"Man... I was surprised.`
` ...Remember my father?`
` He looked exactly like him!`
` I really thought that maybe my father had miraculously survived the air raid in Nagoya."`
`I was chasing a man who was running away from the inspection point.`
`There was no way for him to run with a heavy bag of rice on him.`
`So either he'd get arrested with the illegal rice, or escape by ditching the rice that he bought by selling all of his belongings.`
`...In other words, if a person is being chased by the police, that person can't provide his family any rice to eat.`
`Of course, I felt guilty about that.`
`I knew people had to buy the rice to survive.`
`...So we had a tacit agreement to let those who ditched the rice and ran get away.`
`So I always thought the same thing as I chased them.`
` Please throw it away.`
`I didn't want to catch him.`
`...Because I didn't want to hear him crying and pleading in distress.`
`It was then that the old man showed up.`
`He looked exactly like my dead father.`
` I was dumbfounded.`
`Then, all of a sudden, he punched me in the head.`
`If a father disciplines you, as a child, you lower your head in apology.`
`I was so happy to see my father alive that I couldn't hold my joy in.`
`The old man said, `
`"Let him go."`
`When I heard his voice, I realized he wasn't my father. So I thought I'd arrest him for assaulting a policeman.`
`But a young man, like me, who'd barely grown any hairs yet, was no match for an older man used to fighting.`
`"Yeah, he sure taught me a lesson.`
` He gave me a good scolding in the middle of the street after I was all beat up.`
` Na ha ha, who would even listen to him, right?`
` But something struck me then. `
`I kept seeing my father in him.`
` All I could do was listen."`
`"Yeah, he was a ruffian, but he showed his guts, like a real man. That's what made him such a great guy.`
` You don't see men like him nowadays. He was a true example of a man from the good old times."`
`Despite my age, I still needed a father.`
`I needed someone to look up to, and to show me what makes a man a man...`
`When I think about it...`
`I really did have two fathers.`
`The old man was a father, a brother,`
` and my best friend.`
`...But now, here he lies with his head, body, arms, and legs all dismembered...`
` and his right arm hasn't been found.`
`He taught me how to be a man, how to enjoy alcohol, how to play mahjong, and with that right arm, he gave me a good beating when I did something wrong...`
` But that right arm is still missing.`
`"Do you have any suspects?"`
`"Yeah, of course.`
` ...I swear, I'll find the old man's right arm and pay them back for what they've done to him."`
`They're running Hinamizawa from the shadows, and inciting this collective crime they call the dam protests...`
` The Sonozaki family.`
`I declare war within myself.`
`I already know who my enemy is.`
