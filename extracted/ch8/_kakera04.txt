`"Furude-san, thank you for waiting.`
` We just finished the last test.`
` She'll be back soon."`
`"I hope she is able to help..."`
`"Of course!`
` Rika-san will help the whole village.`
` I think we'll be able to come up with a treatment soon.`
` We're still looking into the structure, but we're finding out how important Rika-san is to the villagers. `
`People with more serious conditions can't stabilize themselves.`
` But we've found out if they get close to the queen carrier, they generate some kind of substance in their brain. `
`This substance has a calming effect, and it seems to have the power to bring their symptoms down.`
` If we can produce this substance, it'll end up making for a powerful treatment."`
`"I see...`
` Rika has that kind of power..."`
`"Hee hee.`
` You shouldn't be surprised.`
` People say that maidens of the Furude Shrine have the psychic power to calm both souls and demons, don't they? `
`Even before we discovered it, it was already recorded in the history of the last few hundred years."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I'm impressed with how wise people were back then."`
`"......Meep.`
` The tests are all done."`
`"Rika, good work.`
` You must be getting tired.`
` Why don't you take this and go get something to drink?"`
`"...Meep~!`
` They took a lot of my blood, so I need to replenish."`
`Rika took the 100-yen coin that was offered to her and ran out into the hallway.`
`"...I appreciate Rika-san's help.`
` If she hadn't offered her assistance, our research wouldn't have progressed this far."`
`"Rika is very concerned about her friend with the syndrome. She said she wants to help because of her.`
` ...Doctor, please take Rika's feelings into account."`
`"Of course.`
` We're taking up her precious time every Sunday,`
` so we'll make sure to get to the bottom of this...`
` We may have to put her through some rather rough experiments, but I hope you'll understand."`
`"We'll never harm her in any way, though.`
` She's such an important person.`
` ...Hee hee, she's the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, after all."`
`"......I wonder how people back then found out about this syndrome,`
` and how they knew the Furude family were the descendants of the queen.`
` I'm truly impressed."`
`"By the way, there's something I have to ask you.`
` I would like to ask you for permission to collect her cerebrospinal fluid. `
`Also, there's a chance that we'll have to drill a hole in her skull to examine the inside of her head."`
`"A-A hole in her skull...?"`
`"Of course, we'll take every precaution.`
` Rika-san is the one and only queen carrier.`
` We'll make sure that she's safe. Her safety is our priority."`
`"Of course, since Rika-chan is a girl...`
` we won't shave her entire head.`
` However, we'll have to ask her to stay at the clinic a little longer so we can keep our eyes on her."`
`"She can still receive visitors, of course.`
` You're more than welcome to attend the examination.`
` I'm sure she'll be more relaxed to have someone she knows nearby."`
`".........Do you really need to perform this examination?`
` Is it really safe?"`
`"I can't absolutely guarantee her safety for either collecting cerebrospinal fluid or for drilling a hole in her skull.`
` There's always the off chance something might go wrong. `
`Also, Rika-san may suffer from some physical and emotional discomfort.`
` ...Even if it's this important, we can't perform it without the parents' consent."`
`"............."`
`"Actually, I've already talked to Rika-chan about it."`
`"...What did she say?"`
`"She said that it's fine.`
` Hee hee."`
`"I've explained to her the possibility of danger.`
` But we still need your consent."`
`"......Sometimes, Rika truly believes that she's the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama.`
` So maybe she feels obligated to sacrifice herself for the villagers."`
`"...What an impressive child."`
`"Could you please let me talk to my wife?`
` She understands the situation, but I still need to explain it to her."`
`"Sure, of course.`
` Please talk it over with her."`
`"So this examination is an extremely important step in the process of stamping out the syndrome, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` It will solve the mysteries of Hinamizawa Syndrome for sure."`
`"At least, it'll be the first step."`
`"......As I already explained, if something happens to the queen carrier, the whole community here may be in danger.`
` In other words, it's possible the whole village could end up with terminal symptoms."`
`"That's right.`
` According to the studies, within 48 hours of the death of the queen carrier, everyone with the disease will become dangerously sick.`
` We must prevent that from happening no matter what."`
`"...If something happens to Rika, the whole village will go insane..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's our job to prevent that.`
` It might seem ironic that we have to put your daughter in danger...`
` but this is the only way to stamp out the syndrome."`
`"...Dr. Irie,`
` I hope you'll succeed in that examination."`
`"As I said, there are no guarantees in medicine..."`
`"Sure."`
`Irie answered with a nod, interrupting Takano's vague response.`
`"I will succeed.`
` I'll save Rika-san`
` and the villagers, too.`
` I promise."`
`"...Okay.`
` I'll talk to my wife.`
` I'll let you know our decision."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you."`
`"Hee hee hee hee,`
` ahhhhhhahahaahahahahahahaha..."`
`After Rika and her father left, Takano started to laugh.`
`"What is it?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"Hee hee...`
` Oh, nothing.`
` I just thought it was amusing to get permission from both the patient and her parents beforehand."`
`"...Rika-chan is going through something she doesn't have to.`
` I thought I should as a courtesy......`
` I would have gotten consent from the man last year, had he been in a normal condition."`
`"Are you being tormented with guilt ever since you started your research here?"`
`"......What do you mean?"`
`This type of teasing was normal from Takano, but maybe she had gone a little too far. Irie made it clear how displeased he was to hear that.`
`"You can only research Hinamizawa Syndrome by using living beings.`
` You feel guilty continuing your work because of that."`
`"...Those guilty feelings are a necessity.`
` Whether it's a murder or dissection, the fact that you're taking someone's life is the same. `
`We have to accept that, and at the same time, devote ourselves to our research."`
`"That's an extremely impressive theory you have there.`
` Hee hee.`
` Then, Dr. Irie,`
` how many times have you gotten consent before you cut into people's brains?"`
`"..............."`
`...Irie didn't think Takano knew about that.`
`"How many brains have you cut up without consent, using your selfish theory that people commit crimes due to mental disorders as your excuse?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`".........That is..."`
`"Common sense changes with time.`
` Back then, doctors didn't need to explain anything or get consent beforehand.`
` So I don't think you have to be concerned about the past. `
`It'd be a problem now, but it was okay back then.`
` So that's fine.`
` Hee hee hee.`
` But you feel guilty, and that's why you want to get consent from Rika-chan beforehand, and why you wanted to get it from him, right?"`
`"That's not true.`
` In the first place, the treatment and dissection are..."`
`"Listen, boy.`
` What you want is the stamp of forgiveness known as prior consent.`
` Right?`
` What you want is some stamp of forgiveness, some deception to fill your heart so you can atone for your past sins. `
`If you regretted what you've done, then you'd never get involved with brains again.`
` Yet you're dragging regrets behind as you continue to deal with brains, guilty all the while. `
`If you truly acknowledged your actions as a sin, then you would've refused to accept the appointment as director.`
` Isn't that right, boy?"`
`"......I don't need to listen to this.`
` Excuse me."`
`"You must listen.`
` The field of medicine is constantly won in battles against that era's ethics and social values. `
`When Dr. Takano discovered the existence of the syndrome, the people in power at the time just disregarded their own ignorance and scoffed at his foresight.`
` But he didn't stop researching until he collapsed. `
`He believed that someday he'd be acknowledged.`
` Even if it was after he died, he still believed in it!`
` He could do that only because of how strong his conviction was.`
` If it wasn't for that, he would have given up.`
`A strong will is what keeps research going.`
` Only the most determined can achieve a result!`
` But you don't have that.`
` You're a coward who still can't decide if he should be proud or ashamed of his achievements. `
`How could you accept the position of director with such half-hearted determination...?! `
`You knew from the beginning that this research couldn't be brought to fruition without adding further blood to your already-stained hands!!"`
`".........I don't know what to say.`
` Maybe I am half-hearted."`
`"Then why don't you resign?`
` You'll still have the obligation to keep things secret, but at least you won't have to feel guilty anymore. `
`You may be my partner, but you're also simply a person who was requested by my client.`
` Now that this research institute is fully developed, you aren't needed. `
`If you don't even have the necessary determination to do research to begin with, you're an especially useless partner.`
` I'll never quit researching.`
` I'm not afraid of guilt or regret. `
`My conviction is what will take me to the future.`
` Just like Dr. Takano succeeded, I'll succeed alone!"`
`"......That's impressive.`
` However, though my determination may not come close to yours, I too have a will, and that's why I'm here...`
` As you said, I already have blood on my hands. `
`After I arrived in Hinamizawa, they got even bloodier.`
` ...So I can't just run from my responsibilities.`
` ...I'll probably continue to be tormented by my unatoned sins.`
` But I won't run. `
`I'll get to the bottom of Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
` That's the least I can do for all the people who gave their lives for this research`
` and also for those who will give their lives from now on."`
`Irie wore a determined look on his face.`
`He appeared different from even a moment before, when he was baffled by Takano having brought up those painful memories.`
`For a short while, Irie's eyes displayed his strong will, and then he turned around.`
`"...We'll probably get consent for Rika-chan's examination.`
` So please start preparing for it."`
`"Yes, I understand...`
` Director."`
`They got their consent the following week.`
