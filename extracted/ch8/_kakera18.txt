`Group physical exams are very meaningful for our research.`
`Although it's only for certain age groups, we can examine many of the Hinamizawan residents at the same time.`
`It's a perfect cover for our research center.`
`Also, because of several arrangements, we have a monopoly on the villagers' corpses, and can perform autopsies on them too.`
`...There certainly wasn't an environment this rich in opportunity for those in the medical field.`
`Our follow-up on the work of the late Dr. Takano is going smoothly.`
`...The amount of data he compiled is absolutely astounding. He truly was an incredible researcher.`
`"Excuse me, Director."`
`"...Oh, Takano-san.`
` Thanks for your work."`
`"We just received the rest of the test results from Tokyo.`
` Here they are."`
`"Thank you.`
` It's getting interesting, isn't it?"`
`"Hee hee.`
` I'm glad we can share this joy."`
`Takano-san is my assistant, who was sent from the Self-Defense Force.`
`But she's far from the image I have of an SDF officer.`
`Just like our research is being concealed,`
` maybe her identity is concealed, too.`
`I'm sure her name is an alias as well.`
`I'm just a doctor and a researcher.`
`Without Takano-san's support, it would be impossible for me to manage this institution.`
`She's a pipeline to her clients in 'Tokyo', my assistant,`
` as well as a researcher who's an expert on Hinamizawa Syndrome.`
`Her existence is absolutely necessary here.`
`The more I think about it, the more I feel this should have been the Takano Institute rather than the Irie Institute, and she should have been the director.`
`But that was explained to me when they asked me to take this position.`
`My client wanted a civilian to manage this place.`
`They searched for a person who met their requirements, and there I was. I became the director.`
`...I have a feeling I'm just a puppet on their strings.`
`But I won't just sit here and do nothing.`
`I was asked to research a rare disease.`
`I am a researcher.`
` So of course, I'm excited about that.`
`My clients' goals might be different, but I'm here out of the desire to unravel the mysteries of Hinamizawa Syndrome and be the first person to uncover a new mystery for mankind.`
`"...We have all this data that suggests the existence of a parasite as the cause of the syndrome,`
` yet we still can't find factual evidence of the culprit microbe itself."`
`"That's true.`
` I thought we'd find it easily if we used an electron microscope."`
`Viruses are too small to see with a regular microscope.`
`So the invention of the electron microscope was a dramatic advancement in the world of medicine.`
`However, it's very expensive and there's no way for a normal doctor to acquire one.`
`The late Dr. Takano said an electron microscope could find the cause of the disease, but it seems his theory has been proven wrong.`
`Even Takano-san was hoping an electron microscope would find it.`
` She was disappointed when she didn't uncover anything after all the autopsies she performed.`
`Our research seems to be having its first snag. It has actually stalled our work for several weeks now.`
`So we need to think about where to go from here.`
`"...Which means, they're either smaller than microscropic...`
` Or maybe there is something wrong with the specimen itself."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"For example, as you know, wild mice have tons of fleas on them.`
` But you can't find fleas on dead mice.`
` That's because when the mouse dies, their habitat dies as well."`
`"So, if the host dies, the parasites' world will end too..."`
`"That's right.`
` Just like you won't find a living human in a post-apocalyptic world."`
`"...Therefore, we just have to look into the earth before it ends, right?`
` Hee hee."`
`"That's true...`
` However, we need to think about human rights.`
` It's hard to look into a brain while the patient is still alive..."`
`Examining a living human's brain.`
`...No matter how you sugarcoated it, that bore very grave meaning.`
`From a medical standpoint, it's necessary.`
`...But we have rules and morals in this world.`
`And we have to advance medicine within such boundaries.`
`There was a time when I was studying lobotomies for the betterment of mankind.`
`I don't think I was wrong.`
`...However, could I ever be forgiven under our ideas of ethics?`
`I don't know.`
`One day, my judgment will be handed down by the devil.`
` Whether I'm guilty or not,`
` I have to accept it.`
`As I reflected upon my past,`
` I heard a voice.`
`It was Takano-san's.`
`It was very clear and simple`
` yet`
` it struck me with surprise.`
`"Understood.`
` Let me prepare a world on the verge of death."`
`"...What?"`
`I'm startled.`
`...Sometimes the phrase "advancing medicine" bore the whisper of the devil, tempting us to accept sacrifices.`
`I heard that devil whisper.`
`"Hee hee.`
` It's not that difficult.`
` I just have to find a Hinamizawa resident who is about to die, that's all."`
`"But... even if they're about to die, who would be brave enough to provide their body for research while still alive?"`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` If they're dying anyway, we're just going to put them to sleep a little sooner.`
` On paper, of course.`
` Hee hee."`
`The patient would be legally declared dead, even though they're still alive.`
` And we'd perform an 'autopsy'`
` while they're still alive.`
`"Th-That's impossible...!`
` Besides, if we perform neurological surgery, we have to do a circular incision on the cranial area.`
` Their family will notice the marks for sure..."`
`"That's where we come in.`
` I'll have the Mountain Dogs look for a patient in the local hospital that matches our needs immediately.`
` All you have to do is to wait with a knife and a fork in your hands. `
`I'll bring your meal right away.`
` ...Hee hee hee hee."`
`"U-Understood..."`
`Miyo Takano-san is my partner, there's no question about that.`
`But... I just can't trust her.`
`It's her extremities as a researcher which contrast largely with mine.`
`But... are we so different?`
`I'm here simply waiting with a knife and a fork in my hands, just as she told me to.`
`...I just don't want to witness such a gruesome scene, that's all.`
`What she's preparing for me now`
` is exactly what I want.`
`Who's the hypocrite?`
` ...Not her.`
` It's me.`
`How can I say I'm different, knowing what I've done in the past?`
`I've performed lobotomies without the patient's consent, despite it being surgery that might affect their life forever. How is that different from what she's doing?`
`...I have never doubted my past achievements.`
`However, when I look at her, I start to feel unease.`
`Takano-san is talking to Okonogi-san on the intercom in my office.`
`I'm sure she's telling him to come over so she can explain to him what was just discussed.`
`I'm simply watching without stopping her.`
`I...`
` begin to reflect upon my past`
` to remember why`
` I chose to become a doctor.`
