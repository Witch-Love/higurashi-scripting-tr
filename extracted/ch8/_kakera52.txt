`"I'm going to play outside!!!"`
`A girl's cheerful voice echoed in the house.`
`It was a tenement house, so walls were thin.`
`So of course, her yell carried through to the neighbors, but since it was a child's voice, nobody complained.`
`"Miyoko,`
` we're thinking about going to the mall."`
`Her father's voice didn't reach the girl, because all she was thinking about was making a new secret base with her friends in the field.`
`Her father knew the girl had been looking forward to going to the mall, and that if they went without her, she would be upset.`
`He also knew that the girl liked collecting flags from the kid's meals at the restaurant there, and one more would bring her collection to twenty flags.`
`The girl was making a wish on those flags.`
`She believed if she collected twenty of them,`
` she could become happy.`
`Oh well...`
`He supposed he'd bring a flag home as a souvenir.`
`It wouldn't be a big deal.`
` If he asked a waitress, she'd bring one for him.`
`On that day, due to an accident, the trains were running behind schedule.`
`To make up the time lost,`
` drivers were braking a little too late`
` and accelerating a bit too soon.`
` It was rather unsafe.`
`The Tanashi family didn't own a car.`
` They always used a train to go to the mall.`
`As the girl skipped her way to her friend's house,`
` an unfamiliar woman stopped her.`
`Obviously she wasn't from around there.`
`The ties between the neighbors were very tight around there.`
` The girl knew everyone's face.`
`So if there was a stranger, it was either a new mailman`
` or someone who's lost.`
`The woman said to the girl:`
`"Do you want to live?`
` Or do you want to die?"`
`Any person would think the woman was crazy, asking something like that.`
`But the girl was too innocent to think that way.`
`She answered immediately.`
`"I want to live!!"`
`"Okay.`
` Then go.`
` Your friend isn't home, but go on."`
`"......She isn't home?"`
`The girl couldn't figure out why this woman would know that.`
`As the woman left, the girl stopped her.`
`She was curious,`
` although it was a little scary, as to what response she'd get if she answered differently.`
`"If I want to die, then what?"`
`"You'll get another flag from a kid's meal."`
`"...Eh?!`
`Hey, that's not fair, they're going without me!!`
` That's not fair!!"`
`The girl turned,`
` and tried to run back home.`
`"Are you sure?`
` ...You`
` won't regret it?"`
`The mysterious woman tried to confirm this.`
`"Why would I regret it?"`
`"......I won't tell you.`
` I'm mean."`
`"Hmm..."`
`The girl thought this was some kind of a riddle, so she pondered it for a while,`
` but she couldn't figure it out.`
`Then she clapped her hands as if she came to a conclusion.`
`"That's okay, then."`
`"Why is it okay?"`
`"Because my parents will be with me."`
`"............"`
`The woman stepped aside.`
`The girl bowed to her and ran home.`
`She saw her parents locking the door to leave.`
`The girl jumped on them and nagged them that she wanted to go too.`
`The girl was going to the mall with her family.`
`The family headed to the train station,`
` waited for a train to arrive,`
` and got on it.`
`The driver was feeling the pressure to make up for the delay`
` and the passengers could tell that from the way he was driving.`
`The girl noticed the unusual swaying of the train.`
`She stood on her knees and looked out the window.`
`Her mother told her to sit down, because it was dangerous.`
` The girl stuck her tongue out.`
`...Then,`
` the train reached`
` a very big`
` and very sharp`
` curve.`
`The train tilted in that direction, and all the people were shoved to the side.`
`They were all squished together, and grumbled about it.`
`Then,`
` the train continued`
` to...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`The girl and her parents came home under the sky full of stars with shopping bags in their hands.`
`They unlocked the door, turned the lights on,`
` and then the girl put her bags by the front door and ran into her room.`
`She opened her desk drawer,`
` took something out of her pocket, and put it in.`
`She closed the drawer once, but opened it again,`
` and then spread her treasure on the tatami floor.`
`They were the flags of many different countries`
` that came with the kid's meals.`
`The Japanese flag, the American flag, the English flag... Which country was this for?`
` The one with three colors...`
`She lined them up as she counted.`
` She counted out loud.`
`Then, she danced around happily.`
`For she now had twenty of them.`
`It took her so long to collect that many.`
`It was hard work for this girl, who was so proud of herself for reaching her goal.`
`She worked so hard that there must be something good waiting for her.`
`She made a wish to become happy if she collected twenty of them.`
`Therefore, something wonderful must be waiting to happen.`
`The girl waited excitedly, but soon realized it wasn't a magic lamp, so no genie would be jumping out.`
`Maybe it wouldn't happen that night. Maybe it'd be tomorrow.`
` The girl decided to wait patiently.`
`She accomplished something as great as collecting twenty flags.`
`Surely, some wonderful happiness awaited.`
`Surely, some wonderful miracle awaited.`
`Or perhaps it might be like a charm, keeping sad misfortunes at bay.`
`The girl put her twenty flags back in the drawer.`
`As she heard her mother tell her to brush her teeth and go to bed, she ran to the bathroom.`
`This is fine,`
` isn't it?`
`It's okay to get a miracle in advance.`
`Hmm, what should I do next?`
`There are plenty of Fragments to play with.`
`What?`
` You want to try too?`
`Hee hee, it's fun.`
` It makes you feel like God.`
`A world with Satoshi or a world where the Sonozaki sisters didn't switch.`
`I wonder what a world with Satoko's parents and Rika's parents alive and well would be like?`
`Oh, how about this?`
`Akasaka gets enticed to the enemy's side by Takano.`
` Ahaha, that sounds interesting.`
`Personally, I'm curious about a world where Takano is madly in love with Tomitake.`
`It'll be fun to match Keiichi with different girls too.`
` I love drama very, very much!`
` Hee hee!`
`Let's see, what should I do next?`
` I have so many Fragments.`
`Hey, do you want some?`
` What kind of world are you going to make?`
