`The Houjou family is well known for going against the whole village during the dam conflict.`
`Both the husband and the wife were rather aggressive, and they fought a fierce battle, especially against the Sonozaki family.`
`Although the whole village treated them coldly, the husband and wife didn't really care, and kept on fighting.`
`In a way, they were extremely strong-willed people.`
`I'm sure their children had to go through a lot because of them, though.`
`Satoko-chan and Satoshi-kun were treated coldly by the villagers as well.`
`In addition to that, Satoko-chan and her stepfather didn't get along, so their stress levels must have reached their limit.`
`Because I'm the director of the local clinic, a rather respected member of society, people usually tell me a lot of things.`
`So I was aware of the treatment they were receiving even before I met them.`
`I met Satoshi-kun first.`
`Satoshi-kun came to the clinic because he felt ill from too much stress.`
`He must have thought he had a cold.`
`When I examined him, he even told me that.`
`But hearing his repeated sighs and by seeing the exhausted look in his eyes,`
` I knew right away it wasn't just a simple cold.`
`Medication would heal his symptoms.`
`But that'd only be a temporary measure.`
`The only way to truly cure him would be to change his living environment.`
`But that was easier said than done.`
`He was surrounded by tangled and complicated relationships with the village and his family, so just resting for a few days and taking some medication wouldn't do.`
`Time was the only thing that could ease off the cold treatment from the villagers, but we were talking a very, very long time.`
`...That's why I felt I had to be their first ally in this village, so I could rescue them.`
`I couldn't do anything about his stressful environment, but I could try to diminish the anxiety.`
`So I thought the best way was to teach him how to vent his stress.`
`And playing sports is the best way to do that.`
`So I asked him to join the junior baseball team that I coach.`
`As a researcher, I devote most of my time to Hinamizawa Syndrome, but I too need to do something else to relax.`
`I used to play baseball, so I decided to coach the local kids' team.`
`After a while, the children of Hinamizawa started their own baseball team and somehow, I became their coach.`
`Doctors can't provide health just by giving medication.`
`You need a sound mind in a sound body.`
`I believe health can be maintained through sports as well.`
`But our team needed more people.`
`So I thought of asking Satoshi-kun to join.`
`Being a bookworm, Satoshi-kun wasn't interested in playing sports. He wasn't sure how joining the baseball team would help his situation.`
`I didn't need to go on and on about athletic medicine to explain why sports help people become healthy.`
`I just wanted him to experience it himself, to realize how great it feels to play sports.`
`I think he realized it gradually.`
`He was reluctant until the very end, but he attended all of the team activities and games.`
`As I saw Satoshi-kun slowly regain his liveliness, I realized my plan worked.`
`However, if Satoshi-kun was under that much stress,`
` then Satoko-chan, who lived in the same family climate, must have felt the same way.`
`Unfortunately, I didn't think of her back then.`
`...So when Satoko-chan was carried into my clinic as a patient, I regretted doing nothing about her even while knowing the situation.`
`As Satoshi-kun recovered under my guidance, Satoko-chan was left alone in her stressful environment.`
`Also around that time, there was an incident bad enough to make Satoko-chan collapse.`
`That was, of course, her parents' deaths.`
`The day of the Watanagashi festival was a very uncomfortable time for the Houjou family, because although it was a village festival, it was also a day to celebrate victory over the dam construction project.`
`It's understandable that they would plan a family trip around that time so they could leave the village.`
`Satoko-chan's parents fell off the cliff at the park they were visiting.`
`It happened on such an unlucky day.`
`Because it happened on the day of Watanagashi, people said it was the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`And people labeled the Houjou family as one that was cursed by Oyashiro-sama.`
`The parents were given the cold shoulder by everyone in the village.`
`So with their parents gone, Satoshi and Satoko should have been freed from that, but...`
` Unfortunately, the accident happened on the day of Watanagashi. `
`That's why the members of the Houjou family continue to be shunned.`
`Satoko-chan was the only one who was at the site of the accident.`
`(Satoshi-kun didn't go on the trip because he had an event with the baseball team.)`
`Therefore, the police mainly interrogated her.`
`...The detective, Ooishi, suspected an act of organized crime by the village, so with Satoko-chan as the only witness on site, he drilled her with questions.`
`She was as stressed as Satoshi-kun, perhaps even more, so of course she couldn't take it.`
`During the interrogation, she began to wheeze and gasp for air.`
`The anguished look I saw on Satoko-chan's face when she was carried into the clinic was very, very tragic.`
`It broke my heart just to imagine what she had to go through.`
`"...Coach, is Satoko okay?"`
`"Yes, don't worry.`
` She's a bit confused, but only temporarily. That's all."`
`"May I see her?"`
`"She finally fell asleep...`
` so I'd rather not wake her up just yet.`
` Let's just let her rest for awhile.`
` Maybe it's a good idea to have her stay here for a few days too.`
` ...Don't worry.`
` I'll take good care of her."`
`"Th-Thank you."`
`I know Satoshi-kun is a great big brother who truly cares about his sister.`
`He empathizes deeply with her.`
`In other words, Satoshi-kun's worries and stress were reflecting Satoko-chan herself.`
`Maybe I shouldn't say this, but while Satoshi-kun was, of course, sad about his parents' deaths, he may, at the same time, have been a little relieved that they were gone.`
`His sister wouldn't have to be driven into a corner anymore.`
`Unlike Satoshi-kun, Satoko-chan didn't have the social skills to get along with her stepfather.`
`So, putting her mother aside, I was certain that losing her father, the greatest cause of stress in her life, would bring great change to her home environment.`
`......But I couldn't believe what happened next.`
`The two were sent to live in an even worse environment with their aunt and uncle.`
`Although at that time, I was rather optimistic, thinking this new environment would be better for the siblings.`
