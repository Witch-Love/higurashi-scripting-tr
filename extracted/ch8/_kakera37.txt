`"Hello?"`
`"Hello hello, good afternoon.`
` ...Oh, who are you?"`
`"Ah, sorry.`
` We just moved in next door.`
` We're here to introduce ourselves.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Oh my, oh my!`
` Someone as young as you moved here?`
` I see, I see, welcome!!`
` Mom!!`
` Our new neighbor is here to say hello!!"`
`"Don't yell like that!`
` Thank you for taking time to come over."`
`"They're the Ryuugu family.`
` They just moved into the empty house next door."`
`"......Aaahhhh!!`
` You're Reina-chan, aren't you?`
` My, how you've grown!"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha.`
` Yes, I'm Reina.`
` Thank you for remembering, hauu..."`
`"Mom, do you know her?!"`
`"Of course I do!`
` You were living in Okinomiya then, so you probably don't remember.`
` But they used to live next door.`
` So, you came back huh?`
` This village is better than the big city, is it?"`
`"I don't remember much because I was so small when we lived here...`
` but I feel this is where I belong."`
`"Then you'll fit right in!`
` If there's anything we can do for you, let us know!`
` There's no need to hesitate. Being unreserved is the rule here, after all."`
`"Ah, yes!`
` Thank you very much."`
`I thought I'd remember things if I walked around the village, but I still don't remember much.`
`I do recall, however, the vivid breeze, as well as the brilliant greenery.`
`I don't remember the village, but I remember that this is my hometown.`
`...Red scars still remain on my body.`
`They're hardly visible, and I can't even feel them.`
`I'm sure they'll disappear soon.`
`Now that I'm back in Hinamizawa, sometimes I wonder who I was back in Ibaraki.`
`In fact, I think I wasn't myself from the moment I left.`
`And now, by coming back here, I've finally regained my true self.`
`I can hardly remember what I was like back in Ibaraki.`
`...Well, that's probably because of the red medicine.`
`The medicine erased all of my painful memories.`
`Maybe... that was for the best.`
`I just wanted to be forgiven back then.`
`I couldn't forgive my mother,`
` I couldn't forgive Uncle Akihito,`
` and more than anybody, I couldn't forgive myself.`
`I wanted someone to acknowledge that I wasn't at fault.`
` I wanted to be forgiven.`
`...So Oyashiro-sama apologized.`
`She told me I wasn't at fault, because it was the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
`That's how I was able to forgive myself.`
`I didn't have to die by tearing my blood vessels out of my body.`
`...I think people have to die because they become corrupted.`
`That's why people try their hardest not to dirty themselves all their lives.`
`But I'm still living, despite how dirty I am.`
` I've been allowed to live.`
`Is there still some filth left on me?`
`Or am I all clean?`
` I don't know.`
`The only thing I know is that the me who lived in Ibaraki and the me who's here right now are two different people.`
`I no longer feel the need to take responsibility by ripping myself apart because of the filth.`
`After arranging some furniture and unpacking some boxes, we finally had dinner.`
`Although I hardly remember Hinamizawa, my father remembers things very clearly.`
`"Although it was around when we lived here before, the Watanagashi festival has grown huge these days.`
` It's held at the end of June."`
`"Watanagashi?"`
`"I've never seen it myself, so I don't know too much about it. But supposedly people let cotton absorb the filth on their bodies and drift it down the stream."`
`Absorb`
` the filth.`
`"You can wash your filth down the stream, huh?"`
`"Aha ha ha ha, of course.`
` Humans are sinners.`
` As we live every day, filth piles up on our bodies, supposedly.`
` And once a year, we get rid of the filth by letting the cotton absorb it."`
`People become burdened with filth and sin by doing something bad.`
`Court sentences can settle your crimes legally, `
`but that doesn't mean the burden of sin, of the filth, will just go away.`
`In other words, human hands can't erase human filth in this human world.`
`The filth is something humans can't get rid of`
` and that's why we need a god from a different world to do that.`
` ...That's what I thought.`
`But... I'm surprised to learn about Watanagashi.`
`Human hands erasing human filth in the human world.`
`Letting the cotton absorb the filth and drifting it down the stream.`
` That means it's okay to live in this world.`
`I tried to commit suicide because I couldn't forgive myself.`
`Oyashiro-sama apologized to me and told me to come back to Hinamizawa.`
`And now, here in Hinamizawa, there's this Watanagashi, a ceremony to get rid of filth.`
`This isn't just a coincidence.`
`Hinamizawa is`
` a place to wash away your filth.`
`It forgives sins.`
`It is a place of forgiveness.`
`"It's called a purification ceremony."`
`"...Ah,`
` I've heard of those before."`
`"Japanese culture is very strict about filth.`
` You aren't allowed to remain in the spotlight if you accumulate too much. `
`See, that's the reason why politicians and company presidents resign immediately once people find out about their dirty deeds.`
` You must leave the spotlight if you're filthy. `
`To put it in a bad way, the filth is basically pushed onto someone else, and they are held responsible for it."`
`Sins and filth must be removed.`
`That's why people push them onto someone else and then try to get rid of the filth by sacrificing that person.`
`But if that's the case, every time that filth is created, people will try to pass around responsibility for it.`
`That's awfully hideous. It's almost like seeing demons in the human world.`
`That's why they came up with the idea of letting the cotton absorb all the filth.`
`By doing so, people can live without making someone else take on all the responsibility, sins, and filth.`
`Putting everyone's sins onto someone and then killing that person makes that person a sacrifice.`
`Who wants to be a sacrifice?`
`That's why they desperately push their sins around.`
`A purification ceremony is about replacing the human sacrifice with a nonhuman one.`
`The purification ceremony dramatically changed Japanese culture. Before then, people always believed someone had to become a sacrifice.`
`In other words, `
`even with filth, everyone can live without blaming someone else.`
`Filth can be forgiven by a method other than death.`
`Only an existence higher than humans can forgive them.`
`I was forgiven by Oyashiro-sama and came back to this place.`
` To Watanagashi, the purification ceremony that exists here.`
`Letting cotton absorb the filth and drifting it away.`
`There's no need for a sacrifice.`
` That's why I've been allowed to live.`
`The filthy me has drifted away,`
` so the me that remains is no longer Reina Ryuugu.`
`If I'm not Reina, `
`then`
` who am I?`
`If I'm without filth, without all the icky things, who am I?`
`...A name vaguely appeared in my head.`
`My new name, that only removes one of the letters from 'Reina', `
`but I think it's a cute name.`
`All the 'i'-cky things are erased and forgiven with the removal of that one letter.`
`So my name is no longer Reina.`
`My name is...`
