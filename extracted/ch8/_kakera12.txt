`That very night.`
` The head of the Furude family, the priest, gathered his wife and Rika together for a family meeting.`
`In Hinamizawa, it was tradition for the Three Families to gather and discuss the village's issues.`
`So it was hardly unusual for big families like the Sonozaki family and the Kimiyoshi family to have meetings beforehand to sort out opinions among themselves.`
`...However, the Furude family had lost its branch families, so there were only three of them left.`
`So until that day, they had never had a family meeting at all.`
`"What is it? You're being so formal.`
` Is it about the dam construction?"`
`The dam was the most important issue in the village at the moment.`
`The wife naturally assumed the priest wanted to talk about the dam.`
`For him to gather all of them together like that, it must be a huge decision he had to make.`
`Perhaps he was going to talk about joining the pro-evacuation camp.`
`"......No, it's not about the dam...`
` But it's about something extremely important which concerns this village, and perhaps all the ancestors of the villagers too."`
`The Furude family had served in the priesthood of Oyashiro-sama, the guardian deity of the village, for generations.`
`So for him, the head of the family, to start out that way, it must be something extremely important.`
`Yet, he said it wasn't about the dam. So what could he want to talk about?`
`"I married into this family,`
` so I want you and Rika, who carry the true blood of the Furude family, to listen very carefully.`
` .........You two aren't normal human beings."`
`"......I'm the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, right?"`
`"Rika, you shouldn't say such things!`
` Dear, let's talk about things like that without her.`
` She's heard enough nonsense from the elderly people at the village hall already."`
`"What she just said, about her being the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama...`
` That appears to be true."`
`"What...?!"`
`"...It's a rather long story.`
` Please, just sit tight and listen to me."`
`The wife had a dumbfounded expression on her face, not knowing what he was going to say, but Rika was completely relaxed, wearing her usual carefree expression.`
`The priest started to talk after his wife calmed down.`
`"There is a disease in this village that has been here for many years.`
` It's a special disease which only exists here in this area.`
` Everyone who lives in this village has the disease. `
`Not only the people who live here now,`
` but all the people who ever lived here had the disease."`
`"What...?`
` But we're all perfectly healthy.`
` I've never heard of a disease exclusive to this village...!"`
`"Calm down.`
` As long as we are here in the village, the disease won't cause any problems.`
` But once you move away from this village, that's when it starts to act out.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"How... How can you expect me to understand such a thing? I have no idea what you're talking about."`
`"......It's the same as the curse of Oyashiro-sama."`
`Rika said it so calmly while her mother became frustrated.`
`"That's right.`
` They say that when you leave this village, you're cursed. It's just like that. `
`In other words, the curse of Oyashiro-sama, which our ancestors have feared for generations, is actually a disease that only exists in this village."`
`"How could that be possible?`
` We've left the village before.`
` Other villagers, too. Some have gone on business trips, and some even traveled to foreign countries!"`
`"True.`
` But that's probably because the disease has weakened over a long time.`
` So it was going to disappear eventually.`
` ...But the business with the dam disrupted that process. `
`...Everyone knew that during the dam war, the entire village was aflame with agitation.`
` Such excitement and emotional instability makes the disease stronger."`
`"I still don't know what you're trying to say.`
` What we thought was a curse all this time was actually caused by the disease?"`
`"That's right.`
` All the rules Oyashiro-sama came up with were to protect the villagers from the disease."`
`"...No way...!!`
` Then Oyashiro-sama's actually a disease... not a god?!`
` How could that be?!`
` How can I explain that to the Furude family ancestors?!"`
`"Calm down.`
` The faith in Oyashiro-sama won't change.`
` The fact that Oyashiro-sama is watching over Hinamizawa will remain the same... `
`...It just means the disease producing Oyashiro-sama's curse was in this village since long ago, that's all."`
`"I won't accept that!!`
` How can I explain that to our ancestors?!`
` This is a desecration of the Furude family's age-old traditions.`
` No, this is a desecration of Oyashiro-sama!!`
` Who told you such a thing?! `
`This isn't acceptable!!`
` In the first place, can you prove such a disease actually exists?!"`
`"......I can!"`
`"What kind of proof?`
` Who gave it to you?"`
`"The people from the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Infectious Disease Prevention.`
` They've already found the pathogen, and they are searching for a cure right now. `
`I saw the documents and the samples last week.`
` The people at the Ministry of Health call it 'Hinamizawa Syndrome'."`
`"No way..."`
`"As long as you lead a normal life, the syndrome is harmless.`
` But once you go far from Hinamizawa, or if you become emotionally unstable, it's easy for the disease to manifest itself. `
`When the disease acts out, you can be possessed by your own delusions and, in the worst-case scenario, you can go mad.`
`They discovered this disease during the war.`
` A distinguished scholar noticed that only the soldiers from Hinamizawa came down with an abnormal disease, and he has been researching it all these years. `
`They explained some details of this research, but I'm sorry...`
` They are too complicated for me to explain.`
` If you don't believe what I'm saying, why don't you go listen to them yourself? `
`...At first I was indignant too, wondering how they dared to blaspheme Oyashiro-sama and spout such nonsense."`
`"............."`
`"The Irie Clinic was built to study the syndrome.`
` It appears to be just a clinic on the outside, but it's actually a secret research center for studying the syndrome."`
`"Secret research? That's ridiculous!!`
` If it's actually backed by the Ministry of Health, why aren't they doing it out in the open?"`
`"Well, I guess they can't.`
` For example, think about leprosy victims who were misunderstood and exiled. They are still misunderstood and discriminated against even today, in fact. `
`If the whole country finds out about this and thinks that everyone in Hinamizawa who has contracted this weird disease can go mad at any moment, it'll turn into chaos. `
`The Ministry of Health has taken that into consideration and is working on developing a cure while keeping the disease a secret.`
`Don't get me wrong, though. They aren't trying to put us on display or anything.`
` They are trying to eliminate this disease and free this village from it. `
`It was a different story long ago when we supported ourselves, but nowadays, it's impossible not to leave the village. `
`If a simple act of leaving the village can trigger the disease, you realize how dangerous it is for the villagers, right? `
`...I'm repeating myself now, but in the recent dam protests, the whole village entered a strong excited state, which is very bad for the Hinamizawa Syndrome."`
`"...If some villagers go crazy and do something horrible, it'll be all over the media."`
`"That's right.`
` If that happens, it'll be too late."`
`".........But...`
` how can I believe this?`
` Are you sure we're dealing with people from the government?`
` Are you sure you aren't being tricked?"`
`"I don't blame you for not being able to believe it...`
` They said we can come take a look at their facility anytime.`
` I've seen it before and I know that no mere fraud could have set up something like that... `
`Even the big hospitals in Gogura don't have such large-scale equipment.`
` If you can't believe what I just told you, you should go to the research center yourself and ask questions. `
`They can explain it better than I can.`
` They said if their explanation isn't good enough, they can explain it to you at the National Research Institute in Tokyo, or even at the Ministry of Health's main office."`
`"............`
` Whether I believe it or not, ...how are we related to that?"`
`"It is said that the Furude family inherited the blood of Oyashiro-sama. `
`And it is also said that if a girl was born for eight continuous generations, that eighth generation girl would be the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama."`
`"......Meep."`
`"That's right.`
` I'm the seventh`
` and Rika is the eighth generation.`
` But what does that have to do with the disease?"`
`"Hmm.`
` ...This Hinamizawa Syndrome is caused by a type of parasite.`
` Although they're very tiny.`
` You can't even see them with the naked eye.`
` ...They say there's a sort of leader among these parasites."`
`"A-`
` Are you saying...`
` that's the Furude family?"`
`"It appears that the leader of these parasites is passed down through the generations only by people with a direct bloodline to the Furude family.`
` In other words, in the previous generation, it was you `
`and now it's Rika."`
`"......Meep."`
`"Th-That's ridiculous!!`
` That's absolutely ridiculous!!`
` Why would it be something as disgusting as parasites in the first place?!"`
`"Calm down!!`
` I'm not good at explaining things.`
` Please have the experts explain it to you.`
` According to them, studying this parasite leader is necessary in order to research the disease."`
`"No!!`
` I won't have anything to do with such suspicious research, and Rika won't either!!"`
`"I'm telling you to calm down!!`
` They think that Hinamizawa Syndrome acts out when separated from the parasite leader, not the village itself. `
`...When you were little, do you remember villagers telling you that you had psychic powers?`
` You were able to cure elderly people who got migraines after taking a long trip. `
`That's the proof that you were carrying the parasite leader.`
` The Furude bloodline has the power to cure people with the disease.`
` To discover a cure, it's extremely important that we participate in their research."`
`"......If they study me, will the villagers be saved?"`
`"That's what they say."`
`"......And all the villagers are infected?`
` Me?`
` Everyone else?`
` Satoko, too?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Not only the people who live in the village, but their relatives in Okinomiya too.`
` We're talking thousands of people. `
`That's why the Ministry of Health spent so much money to build a specialized research center."`
`"I-I object!`
` How can you let Rika be a sacrifice for something that suspicious?!"`
`"......I don't mind.`
` If Satoko can be saved, I don't mind being a sacrifice. I really don't."`
`"You be quiet, Rika!!`
` I absolutely refuse!`
` I'll go talk to them and refuse them directly.`
` I won't let them kill Rika in some crazy experiment!!`
` Besides, Rika is the one and only heir of the Furude family!! `
`What if something happens to her? The Furude family will die right there. Don't you see that?!`
` You need to think more about our family!!`
` That's why the villagers call you an opportunist. `
`After all, don't you think it's odd?!`
` The Ministry of Construction is trying to submerge the village`
` and the Ministry of Health is trying to cure a disease.`
` What in the world is going on?!"`
`"The Ministry of Health has warned that this disease could be triggered by a change in environment. So they're actually trying to have the Ministry of Construction stop the dam construction plan. `
`...You really should go to the research center.`
` Why would they build such a huge facility in a location that could be submerged?"`
`"......Hwaaaaaah..."`
`Rika let out a big yawn.`
`It was long past bedtime for a little girl like her.`
`"......I'm going to bed now.`
` Dad, please let them know I'm willing to participate, okay?"`
`"R-Rika!!`
` You can't make such a decision without consulting me!!!`
` Rika!`
` Wait, Rika!!!"`
