`"...Sorry for being late.`
` I had an unusually large number of patients today."`
`"Thank you for coming, Lieutenant Colonel Irie!!"`
`Tomitake stood up suddenly and saluted when he saw Irie come into the room.`
`"Alright, alright, stop calling me Lieutenant Colonel!`
` I'm a doctor. I just can't get used to military ranks.`
` Can you call me Director instead?"`
`"Understood, Director Irie.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`Tomitake, of course, knew that Irie didn't like to be called Lieutenant Colonel, so it was something of a joke.`
`They laughed casually together.`
`On the other hand, Takano looked rather fed up with it.`
`She couldn't stand hearing the same joke over and over, and was even thinking about talking to Tomitake about it.`
`....But she didn't want to hurt his feelings, so she simply never had the chance.`
`Maybe it's because of how Tomitake pronounces it, but she keeps hearing "Risa". (Lieutenant Colonel in Japanese: Nisa)`
`Once she heard it that way, she kept hearing\n"Irie Risa" every time Tomitake said it.`
`When Takano told Irie about it, he had a good laugh.`
`Today was just a simple meet-and-greet, and tomorrow was the actual meeting.`
`Tomitake had already arrived, but there would be more inspectors from Tokyo at the meeting, waiting to hear about the progress that had been made.`
`"Anyway, I heard the whole village is all up in arms about the dam construction project."`
`"You can say that again!`
` The village is in such a mess.`
` I participated in the local municipal explanation meeting as an official, but... the whole thing was alive with angry shouts and profanities."`
`After the basic Hinamizawa Dam Project was announced, the village was consumed with uproar.`
`The government retracted their plans for concessions rather early on.`
`They made their aggressive stance clear.`
`They didn't want the locals to take advantage of them by showing their willingness to compromise.`
`However, that backfired horribly.`
`As they had historical ties to the land, the government's actions only made their bonds stronger.`
` Neither the government nor the locals wanted to back down.`
`"Hee hee hee.`
` People from Hinamizawa are rather hot-tempered.`
` Maybe because they're the descendants of demons."`
`"It's not funny.`
` That wild meeting lasted all night!"`
`"I feel your pain.`
` Ha ha ha ha...!"`
`"Really, it's not funny, Tomitake-san.`
` So, what's going on with the dam construction?`
` Are they really going to submerge this village?"`
`"Tokyo's applying their pressure to the situation too.`
` Things might seem clamorous on the surface, but in truth, the supporters behind it are wavering rather hard."`
`"...I hope their pressure produces results soon.`
` The whole village is buzzing with action from dusk to dawn, and I worry the villagers' minds are growing agitated. `
`Sometimes I have to listen to my patients go on and on about their opinion on the dam construction plan."`
`"Hee hee.`
` Why do you even listen to them? You're too nice."`
`"I have to.`
` I'm a clinic director first, and research center director second.`
` It's part of my job to listen to them."`
`"That's very nice of you.`
` It's admirable."`
`"I know the people in Tokyo will call off the plan sooner or later, but the villagers don't.`
` So they have to live in fear that they might be forced to leave the land where they've lived for generations."`
`"Even if they're told to leave, they don't have money, and a lot of them are old.`
` Maybe some wanted an increase in the amount of compensation they'd be offered, but the government changed its mind. `
`I don't think it's possible for them to come to a peaceful agreement at this point."`
`"There were actually some villagers who were satisfied with that amount and were willing to leave.`
` However, the Sonozaki family didn't want to change their stance against the issue. `
`They're actually leading the villagers in the fight against the government.`
` There are blaring announcement vans everywhere, and ads and flyers are attached to the circulation notices."`
`"It's a serious matter for them.`
` I guess I can understand."`
`"...I hope the construction plan will be called off soon, for their sake.`
` Once it's called off, this village will become peaceful once again."`
`"I know that, of course.`
` Things are moving right along in Tokyo, so please give us a little more time."`
`"...I've heard a rumor from Tokyo that you're having problems finding a way to pressure the Minister of Construction. Is that true?"`
`"Oh... ha ha ha...`
` I'm not sure, but I've heard myself that they are having a little problem with some of the details."`
`Takano had powerful people supporting her, but they didn't control all of Japan.`
`There were some things they excelled in, but also other things that they weren't too good at.`
`Finding a way to put pressure onto the Minister of Construction fell into the latter.`
`"In all seriousness, though...`
` We really won't be facing any requests to leave this area because of the dam, right...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` I can guarantee that won't happen.`
` It's just taking longer than we thought, that's all. So please continue your research. `
`We were told that if things can't be resolved peacefully, then we may have to use drastic measures."`
`"Drastic measures? What do you mean, Tomitake-san?"`
`"You don't need to worry about that part,`
` Director Irie.`
` Please let us take care of it."`
`"...I see.`
` Okay.`
` Thank you for your work."`
`"It's fine, Director Irie.`
` The dam construction plan will be called off.`
` ...It's already been decided.`
` ...Hee hee."`
`As Takano giggled, Tomitake laughed too.`
`However, Irie couldn't understand what was so funny, so he felt left out.`
`......Irie only understood the meaning of those drastic measures when he examined a young boy he had never seen in the village before.`
