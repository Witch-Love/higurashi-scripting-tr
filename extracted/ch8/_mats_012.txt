`"Ohhhhh, Akasaka-saaaaan!!!`
` Long time no see!!!"`
`"Ooishi-san!`
` You haven't changed a bit!"`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` What are you saying?`
` I've been on an apple diet lately, and I've lost a few pounds.`
` Can't you tell?`
`But just look at you!! You look great!!!"`
`"Well, I have to stay in shape for my job."`
`"Hey, Kura-chan.`
` Is this the guy?`
` The one who came here a few years ago from Tokyo?"`
`"Nice to see you again too, Hondaya-san.`
` It has been a while."`
`"My my, look at you!`
` Must be nice to be so young!!"`
`"Well, since you came such a long way,`
` let's just head to a restaurant!`
` I'm a regular there, so I'm sure we can get in before it opens.`
` Come on."`
`"Ooishi-san, are you sure?`
` Don't you still have some work to do?"`
`"What? Not at all!`
` I'm on special training with a mission investigator from Tokyo headquarters!`
` Come on, let's get going!!`
`Oh wait, I've got to make a phone call first.`
` They're greenhorns compared to someone like you,`
` but I've put some help together for us.`
`Ah, there you are!!`
` Kuma-chaaan!!`
` Do you want to come play with us tonight?"`
`"Ooishi-san, you really haven't changed a bit... hahahahaha."`
`Akasaka used to think Ooishi wasn't serious enough about work,`
` but after experiencing many different things in the real world, that preconception had completely disappeared.`
`Ooishi is that way because of his experience.`
`It's not always best to take things seriously.`
`In this world, sometimes being that frank can help.`
`In Akasaka's case, people often tell him to relax more.`
`But in Ooishi's case, maybe he should straighten out a little.`
`"Come on!!`
` Akasaka-san, let's go!!"`
`"Yes, at once!"`
`"Yeah, good answer.`
` You sound like a veteran police officer now.`
` Glad to hear it!"`
`The old Akasaka would have thought Ooishi was making fun of him, but by now he could take it as an honest assessment.`
`"Boy, you sure can drink now, Akasaka-san.`
` I don't think I can keep up with you.`
` Must be true that when one gets old, he can't drink as much as before."`
`"You're too modest.`
` I'm just better because an intelligence officer has to be able to hold his liquor.`
` I have a budget set aside at all times for training with my young colleagues. `
`Japanese sake, western liquor, Chinese liquor, whatever!!`
` Sometimes I drink at little bars and sometimes at expensive clubs."`
`"Na ha ha ha ha!!`
` That sounds pretty good!`
` I'll have to join you to coach them sometime!"`
`"Yes, please come teach us your tricks.`
` Young guys nowadays often talk about how they can't drink.`
` I couldn't drink at all at first, you know. `
`The more you drink, the better your body adjusts to alcohol, and the more you enjoy drinking!"`
`"That's right!!!`
` Are you listening, Kuma-chan?"`
`"Yeah, I heard...`
` I can down quite a few now!"`
`"Wa ha ha ha!!`
` No really, you're right.`
` When you first teamed up with Ooishi, you were already drinking oolong tea with the toast!"`
`"That's no good!`
` A toast has a very important meaning.`
` If you don't drink any alcohol, you're saying you're not satisfied with the party.`
` So when I see young people like that, I tell them, `
`'I'm not saying that you have to drink up in one gulp!`
` But your first round has to at least be a medium mug!!'"`
`When Akasaka first came to Okinomiya, he was very nervous.`
`But there was no trace of that tension left in him.`
`...Seeing that, Ooishi realized`
` just how much Akasaka had learned in the past few years.`
`"Na ha ha ha ha!!`
` There you go, Akasaka-san!!!`
` Man, you've really grown a lot more dependable!`
` During the years I've been waiting to retire, you've grown so much. `
`It might be time for the younger generation to take over, huh?"`
`"That's not true!`
` If there's one thing I've learned, it's that the only thing that matters is experience. `
`Leave the hard labor and the crime scenes to us young officers, while you veterans take pride at your desks and work us to the bone!"`
`"Did you hear that, Kuma-chaaan? Did you, did yoooouuu?"`
`"Okay, okayyyy! I heard him!!`
` I'll give it everything I've got!!"`
`"Waaahahahahaha!`
` Ooishi, Kumagai-kun is already giving it everything he's got.`
` He's diligent about his patrols to make up for your distaste for them!"`
`"You know how Ooishi-san is, right?`
` I've only worked with him for a few days, but I understand what you're going through.`
` Even so, he'll make you into a good cop.`
` Just believe in him!"`
`"Y-Yes sir!`
` I'll do my best!!`
` But even if I learn how to drink, I can't learn how to be good at mahjong!!`
` Ooishi-san takes all of my pay before I can give it to my wife!!"`
`"Mahjong is intellectual baggage you need!!`
` The more you play, the more confident you get.`
` Let's play together later. I'll teach you how not to lose."`
`"Ooishi, he's a good guy, huh?`
` He kind of reminds me of how you were when you were young!"`
`"That can't be!`
` I wasn't nearly as handsome!`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`It was unusual for Ooishi to enjoy anyone's company this much.`
`Akasaka and Ooishi only worked together for a few days.`
`They had exchanged some holiday cards since, but that was about it.`
`Ooishi had no idea how happy it would make him to see such a greenhorn grow into a dependable cop.`
`Ooishi always thought he wanted to be active until the day he retired,`
` but after seeing such a dependable colleague, he began to think that maybe it was time for him to step down.`
`Ooishi and Akasaka enjoyed their reunion more than they thought they would.`
`The owner of the place was bringing the electric sign inside.`
`All the chairs were up on the tables, and the owner's wife was cleaning the floor.`
`There was nobody else around.`
`Judging by the clock, it was almost three AM.`
`"This is a reunion, right, Kura-chan?`
` Take your time, okay?`
` Just wake me up when you leave so I can lock the door."`
`"Sorry about this. Thank you!"`
`There wouldn't be anything else open at such a late hour.`
`Ooishi and his colleagues still wanted to talk, so they decided to stay.`
`Kumagai couldn't fight his sleepiness and was nodding off.`
`They were talking about Akasaka's job.`
`Akasaka works at a department specializing in Public Safety.`
`Ooishi and the others were interested in all his stories of danger and bravery.`
`"Anyway, I want to meet with Rika Furude."`
`"By Rika Furude, you mean the orphaned daughter of the Furude family?"`
`"Orphaned...?`
` ......What happened to her parents?"`
`Rika Furude had predicted that there would be an incident in Hinamizawa every year for the following five years.`
`Her parents, according to her, were supposed to be killed on the third year running.`
`"Yeah, it was the third year of the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
` Hmmm,`
` 1981, must have been.`
` The Furude couple died rather suspiciously.`
` It was three years after you came to Hinamizawa, Akasaka-san."`
`"Three years?`
` Did it happen in June, three years after I visited?"`
`"Yeah, that's about right.`
` ...Why?`
` Is there something about it that bothers you?"`
`Akasaka shut his eyes tightly to chase away the alcohol in his brain and tried to remember the girl's prediction.`
`...He had, after all, come here to confirm it.`
`"I came here in 1978.`
` And what about the dam construction site manager?`
` Oh, that's the guy I played mahjong with.`
` How has he been doing?"`
`"It was in the newspaper, I think... maybe it was just in the local ones.`
` Well, he was killed in a fight with the other workers that year."`
`...Rika Furude had predicted that he'd be killed in a gruesome way, that his body would be dismembered.`
`"Was he mutilated...?"`
`"See, you know about it already.`
` ...That's exactly it.`
` His right arm is still missing, too.`
` It's so unfortunate..."`
`...The following year, on the same day, in June, 1980.`
`......Satoko's parents will be pushed to their deaths.`
`...Maybe it should be called an accident.`
` ...A lamentable accident.`
`"I'll continue.`
` The following year,`
` the year after the manager's death......`
` I think...`
` let's see...`
` I know.`
` Satoko-san, it was. I think she's a little girl.`
` Did her parents die in an accident?"`
`"Oh, how much do you already know?`
` That's right.`
` The dam supporters, the Houjou couple, fell off a cliff while on vacation.`
` Though it still hasn't been confirmed if it was an accident or an incident."`
`And the following year, on the same day, in June, 1981.`
`My parents will be killed.`
`"And the following year..."`
`"Yes.`
` Rika Furude's parents died.`
` ...But none of those incidents make sense."`
`"You sure know a lot about the curse of Oyashiro-sama.`
` None of those incidents were made public because of pressure from the locals, so I'm surprised at how much you know about them."`
`"............I can't... believe this..."`
`"But even you can't know about the following year.`
` Because starting with the fourth year in a row, we decided to investigate secretly."`
`"...I......`
` think I know about it anyway."`
`And the following year, on the same day, in June, 1982.`
`Satoko's mean aunt will die. Her head will be smashed in.`
`"The following year, so that was last year.`
` Satoko-san from earlier, wasn't her aunt beaten to death?"`
`"Sh-`
` Shit, you're right.`
` Akasaka-san, how do you know so much?"`
`"......I think... I know who will be killed the year after that."`
`"Wh-What`
` are you saying?`
` Besides, the year after last year means... it's this year..."`
`                 ...I'll be killed.`
`"It will be in June of 1983.`
` In other words, this month.`
` ...Rika Furude`
` will be killed."`
`Ooishi and the others were at a loss for words.`
`Akasaka had talked about the four mysterious incidents.`
`Although he had been far away, he belonged to a very special unit of Public Safety.`
`It could have been possible for him to find out about their secret investigations.`
`That was why it wasn't that odd for Akasaka to mention the series of mysterious deaths, even though he had been far away from Hinamizawa.`
`However, not only did he know about them, but he also named the next victim.`
` Ooishi and his coworkers had sobered up entirely.`
`"Akasaka-san...... it's getting late.`
` We're all exhausted, so let me get to the bottom of this.`
` What is it that you're trying to say?"`
`"Okay.`
` All of this is what she told me when I was in Hinamizawa in June of 1978."`
`".........What...?"`
`Ooishi couldn't believe what he was hearing.`
` He was left speechless.`
`"I know it's hard to believe.`
` When she told me back then, I thought she was just being a mischievous little girl.`
` But she told me she was going to be killed in the fifth year running. `
`In other words, she asked me to help her, I think.`
` The main purpose of my visit to Hinamizawa this time is to find her and ask her if she still needs my help."`
`"...Akasaka-san,`
` I'm retiring this year.`
` I want to take revenge on the people who killed the manager on the first year.`
` I'll jump on any lead I can find.`
` So let me just confirm this with you. `
`What you just said isn't a joke, is it?`
` If it is, you had better tell me right now..."`
`"I'm telling you the truth.`
` Rika Furude told me this in June 1978.`
` But at the time, I didn't think anything of it, so I didn't tell you about it.`
` I'm very sorry."`
`"N-No, you didn't know.`
` Even if you had told me, I don't think I would have believed you.`
` Only because it happened four years in a row do we believe you now."`
`Ooishi must have been thinking that if only Akasaka had told him that back then, he could have saved his friend.`
`But what the old man from Forensics just said was right too.`
`Ooishi wouldn't have believed him back then.`
`And his friend would have died anyway, and Ooishi would have been left with regret at not being able to do anything.`
`"...That's true.`
` I should be the one apologizing.`
` ......Still.`
` ...Rika Furude.`
` ...Why Rika Furude?`
` .........Hmmmmmm..."`
`"I don't know exactly what's going on in Hinamizawa right now.`
` I read in the papers that the dam construction plan was halted indefinitely.`
` That's why I assumed Hinamizawa was peaceful now."`
`"Hmm.`
` The dam conflict is over, yeah.`
` But starting the following year, these mysterious deaths, known locally as the curse of Oyashiro-sama, started to occur annually.`
` And it played out just like you said."`
`"......I think she's entrusted me with something extremely important.`
` ...Ooishi-san, let me ask you...`
` Do you think it's possible for Rika Furude to be killed this year?"`
`"...They say that the Furude couple was held in low regard for being so passive during the dam conflict.`
` That might be the reason why the curse fell upon them in the third year.`
` ...So I do think...`
` ......that Rika Furude's death........."`
`"It's possible, isn't it?"`
`Ooishi nodded slowly.`
`"I'm going to try to get in touch with Rika Furude tomorrow.`
` I think the best thing to do is to talk to her directly."`
`"Can I come with you, Akasaka-san?`
` ...This story about Rika Furude sounds like something very important for me, too."`
`"...My my...`
` ...you've come bearing quite the incredible gift.`
` I'm getting a bit intrigued myself.`
` I never thought I'd see the day when all the mysteries were solved."`
`"Well, I have some questions too.`
` For instance, why did she tell me something that important?`
` If she wanted help, why didn't she ask the local police? Why me, a guy on a business trip from Tokyo?"`
`".........Hmm.`
` I bet she doesn't have faith in the local police.`
` I'm a little unrefined.`
` Rika-san probably doesn't trust me.`
` Besides, there are people with connections to the Sonozaki family at the Okinomiya PD."`
`"In other words, she trusted me, the guy who came from Tokyo, more than anybody."`
`"Yeah, I guess."`
`"...If that's the case, Ooishi-san.`
` Please don't tell anybody else about this."`
`"Of course I won't.`
` Anyway, let's head directly to Hinamizawa tomorrow and have a talk with Rika-san.`
` We can start from there."`
`"...It's hard to believe.`
` ......But...`
` it's the truth, isn't it?"`
`It was in the middle of the night. Only the sounds of insects and Satoko snoring could be heard.`
`Rika was sitting by her favorite window.`
`"Yes.`
` Takano is the one who killed you, Rika.`
` You and I both saw it.`
` You tried so hard to remember Takano's face... `
`Even as she cut your stomach open, you burnt her face into your memory while enduring all that pain..."`
`"............That's a horrible way to die.`
` ...I'm glad I don't remember...`
` ...but I can see it.`
` That's the kind of death Takano would prefer."`
`"...Au au au au..."`
`"Still, I don't get it.`
` Why would Takano kill me?`
` I'm the queen carrier, and if I die, a disaster will occur, right?`
` Isn't that why the Irie Institute and the Mountain Dogs are protecting me? `
`Then why would Takano, their leader, have me killed?"`
`"...Au... au..."`
`"Sorry, that was a useless question.`
` Takano killed me.`
` That's the truth, and her motive doesn't matter, does it?`
` ...But... still...`
` Why Takano?"`
`Although she just said that the motive didn't matter, Rika went back to the same question.`
`The reason why Takano was protecting the queen carrier wasn't because she wanted to prevent the rest of Hinamizawa from developing the syndrome.`
`It was because the queen carrier was an extremely valuable subject of her research.`
`Then, considering that value, why did she kill the queen carrier with her own two hands?`
`"Is Takano my only enemy?"`
`"...Au au...`
` The Mountain Dogs are after you too.`
` I don't know if Irie is your enemy or not...`
` But I don't think he is."`
`"Takano and the Mountain Dogs are my enemies...?`
` ......You've got to be kidding me. How can we possibly win?`
` There's no way.`
` Unless there's a miracle of some kind, we can't fight against people like them. `
`Besides, Watanagashi is this Sunday.`
` I'll be killed on the 22nd.`
` It's in about a week or so, right?`
` How can we beat them in such a short amount of time?`
` Should we try going after Takano with a metal bat? `
`That won't work. She's only one of them.`
` Even if we take her out, the Mountain Dogs will still get us!`
` What do we do? What should we do?!"`
`"I... I don't know either...!`
` But,`
` but...`
` but...`
` ...we didn't even know our enemy before now.`
`This time... we do.`
` There must be... something that we can do...!"`
`This was the first time in a long time that Hanyuu had spoken so positively.`
`Rika was startled for a moment`
` and realized that she was losing her cool. She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down.`
`...She was still confused that Takano was the culprit.`
`Rika had always thought of Takano as her ally.`
`There were, after all, many reasons why Takano should treat her well.`
`Rika couldn't even think of one reason why Takano would want to kill her.`
`Still, Takano was always thinking about bizarre things.`
`......There was no guarantee that a crazy idea of hers couldn't become a motive.`
`"...So that means,`
` if Tomitake is killed...`
` then is he...`
` an ally?"`
`"I... I think he is.`
` ...That's an idea, Rika.`
` You should talk to Tomitake!"`
`Takano was accompanied by the Mountain Dogs because of an organization named "Tokyo".`
`So could Rika ask for help only from someone affiliated with that organization?`
`In that case, Tomitake was the only one she could talk to about the issue.`
`Although, Irie might also be worth having a talk with.`
`But then......`
` that was why she needed to know.`
`She needed to know why Takano wanted to kill her.`
`Unless she could explain that, they probably wouldn't even believe her.`
`Besides, Tomitake was in love with Takano.`
`He wouldn't doubt her so easily.`
`Irie seemed to be keeping a little distance from Takano.`
`He might be a little more inclined to believe.`
`But as someone who was simply a doctor, he knew little about Tokyo.`
` He might end up being useless to Rika.`
`Then, should she call the police?`
`No way, definitely no way!!`
` There was no way they would believe her.`
`If she were to make a call and say that a strange organization named "Tokyo" was trying to kill her, they would think she was crazy.`
`Then what could she do? How could she save herself?`
`The scariest people in Hinamizawa were coming to kill her.`
`How could she run from them?`
` How could she fight them?`
` How? How...?!`
`If she had remembered the scene of Takano killing her, then she wouldn't have been so confused.`
`Because seeing is believing.`
`But she didn't remember.`
`This was just what Hanyuu was telling her. She didn't want Takano to be her enemy.`
` This was a truth she didn't want to accept. So she was tempted to just say that this was all simply Hanyuu's delusion.`
`"...C... Calm down, Rika.`
` We learned in our past life.`
` Don't you remember the previous world?"`
`"...The previous world... do you mean... The one where Rena spread gasoline all over the school and locked everyone inside..."`
`"No, no...!`
` The world after that...!`
` Don't you remember...?!`
` In that world, he came back.`
` Teppei Houjou did!"`
`"......That's the worst possible world.`
` No matter what we do, the counselors won't do anything. Satoko goes insane within a few days. `
`Someone from our circle of friends developed the syndrome and attacked Teppei, right?"`
`"No, no, no!!`
` In the previous world, we all went to the child consultation center and saved Satoko!`
` In that world, Keiichi taught you so much. `
`He taught you that you have to believe, otherwise a miracle won't occur.`
` And he also said that if everyone believes, our wishes will definitely come true!!"`
`"...That sure is something Keiichi would say.`
` But that's great.`
` To defeat the world where Teppei returns... We couldn't do anything about that world even once before..."`
`"Do you know how Keiichi and the others in that world made a miracle happen?`
` They talked to everyone! `
`They didn't convince themselves it was useless or agonize over it by themselves, they asked everyone for help...!!`
` That's how they brought about a miracle!!"`
`"Everyone?`
` ...So you want me to talk to Keiichi and the others about Takano?`
` Do you really think they would believe me if I told them an organization like Tokyo is after me?"`
`"Yes, they will!!`
` They did in the previous world!!!`
` Why won't you believe me, Rika?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` It's not that I don't believe you.`
` You saw it, so it's the truth, isn't it?`
` ............I had no idea how frustrating it would be`
` not to remember it myself."`
`"Anyway, you and me going on and on about this won't solve anything.`
` We don't have enough power on our own...!`
` But we have our weapon.`
` That weapon is the truth! `
`We don't know her motive... but we know that the culprit is Takano!!`
` So this is a very good start, compared to all the other worlds.`
`...But why... why can't you remember it... at the very end?"`
`Hanyuu ground her teeth remorsefully.`
`She saw the truth just a short time ago, so she couldn't believe that Rika didn't remember anything.`
`If it was something she had seen herself, then she wouldn't even need a motive.`
`But she hadn't, and that was why she couldn't understand...`
`Why was her memory missing even when Hanyuu's memory was still intact?`
`Did that mean their long journey was about to end?`
`Perhaps her infinitely repeating journey was already over... and this was the last world of all...?`
`"...............Wheeeeeew...`
` I thought this world was odd, since everyone could see you, and you even transferred to our school...`
` but now I can really see how strange of a world this is."`
`"...There's nothing strange about it.`
` ...This is just the final world, that's all."`
`"............"`
`"I came to this final world so we can gather all our powers.`
` I'm not a bystander here.`
` I'm your ally."`
`".........I see...`
` You're no longer`
` a bystander, huh?"`
`"I've decided not to be afraid anymore.`
` I'm not afraid, and I'm going to believe with all of you.`
` And a miracle will happen!`
` This is a world we can bet on, this June of 1983.`
` Rika and Takano are fighting. `
`If Rika doesn't defeat her enemy in time, she will lose.`
` Takano has many powerful pieces, like the Mountain Dogs.`
` Rika will need a lot more pieces to be able to defeat her. `
`So unless Rika asks for help from many people and gathers an equal number of pieces, the game won't even begin...!!`
` We've learned the rules of this game board by playing the game repeatedly.`
`It's like a game without a manual.`
` But we've learned the rules, and now we know how to fight.`
` We're ahead in the game because we already know what pieces our enemy has. `
`Rika, you have to get busy!!`
` We only have one week before Watanagashi!`
` We had two weeks in the previous world, but we only have one week in this one!`
` In other words, this is our final chance!!!"`
`"...Okay.`
` ..Rather than grieving over what I don't remember, I should be grateful that you do.`
` Because if you didn't, this final world would end while we ran about in confusion. `
`Also, if I talk to Keiichi and the others in the right way, maybe they'll come up with some good ideas. `
`Because he was the one who fought with Rena in that previous world, and when the school was about to explode, he brought her back."`
`"Exactly!`
` Anyway, let's go talk to anyone we can find.`
` We are too weak by ourselves.`
` Let's gather people and think about what to do.`
` We have to take our first steps towards the miracle!!"`
`"And we have to do that within a week."`
`Hanyuu had never encouraged her like this before.`
`She had always pretended to be a bystander.`
`She never wanted to go through the pain of failure. So she never had expectations for anything.`
`But now she was trying to intervene in this world so passionately and proactively.`
`......According to Hanyuu, there had been another world after the one in which Rena occupied the school.`
`...Apparently... Keiichi really inspired her in that world.`
`...Rika had nothing to lose.`
` ...She had to talk to whoever she thought she could trust.`
`And whether she tried or not, she had only a very short time left.`
`She decided to do whatever she possibly could until that time arrived.`
`She would never again act like it was cool to sip wine pretending to be a witch as the end closed upon her.`
`"Hello.`
` It has been awhile.`
` This is Nomura.`
` ......Yes, thank you for the detailed documents from the other day. `
`Thanks to that data, men from the Ministry of Health and Welfare now understand how dangerous Hinamizawa Syndrome is.`
` ......Hee hee hee, that's the accomplishment of you and the late Dr. Takano. `
`I've only made sure that you receive your fair assessment, is all.`
`...Anyway,`
` I'll make sure the Prime Minister reads your documents.`
` He's our leader, after all.`
` I'll have the most important person in this country read your article `
`and make sure he understands what important research this is and why Hinamizawa Syndrome is an issue that needs his attention. `
`Also, I'll make sure the present board of directors realize how stupid they were to ignore your research and ridicule your grandfather's thesis.`
`.........Indeed.`
` Hee hee hee, I have great news for you. `
`We've decided that after the operation is completed, the actual location will be isolated and shut down and another department of the SDF will take over the research. `
`You'll be welcome there, and you'll be able to continue your research for as long as you want without worrying about political factions or funding. `
`......Hee hee hee, that's all thanks to your generous client who wants to reward you for your hard work.`
`You'll be given the position of director, so you can devote yourself to your research.`
`Hee hee hee, isn't that wonderful?`
` Finally, you'll be able to accomplish something that overturns common knowledge by researching Hinamizawa Syndrome and the existence of parasites that influence human thought. `
`......No, I'm not just saying that to flatter you.`
` That's what we really think.`
` .........I see.`
` Sorry to take up your time.`
` I'll be going now.`
` I'll get in touch with you again."`
`The woman put down the handset of her car phone. Then she picked it up again and made another call.`
`"Please transfer me to extension 1001.`
` ......Yes, this is Watanabe.`
` .........Watanabe.`
` Yes, the issue from the other day has been taken care of.`
` ......Yes.`
` Major Takano's documents are wonderful. `
`I made some people from the national research center go along, so the men believed it without questioning.`
` .........Hee hee hee, yes.`
` That's no problem either. `
`Most of the cabinet ministers from enemy factions will be either leaving the country or going on vacation, so they'll be out of Tokyo after the 20th.`
`......Yes.`
` There are still some unsettled issues, but everything will be set by June 23rd.`
` ......Yes. `
`Therefore, the on-site operation will take place at midnight on June 22nd, and the Prime Minister will be asked for emergency sanctions on the 23rd. `
