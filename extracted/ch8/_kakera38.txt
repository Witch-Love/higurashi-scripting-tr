`"Mion-saaaaan!`
` Your friend is here!!"`
`I heard the housekeeper's voice.`
`Our house and the front yard are huge, so unlike normal houses, ringing a doorbell, or`
` yelling`
` my`
` name`
` repeatedly`
` asking to play won't work.`
`"Okay, thank you.`
` Who is it?"`
`"Rika Furude-chama."`
`"Oh, finally.`
` Can you tell Granny that Rika-chama is here?`
` I think she's on the porch.`
` I'll get the watermelon."`
`Granny received many beautiful watermelons from somebody, so she wanted to share.`
`I just called the Furude house a short time ago, and Rika-chan is here to pick one up.`
`...Did she come on her bicycle?`
` I can't remember if it has a big enough basket.`
`I pulled the watermelon from the well while thinking about that.`
`The cold water in the well has refrigerated the watermelon, and the condensation makes it look delicious.`
`The three members of the Furude family will enjoy it for at least two nights.`
`"......Meep?`
` Am I supposed to take it home?`
` I thought..."`
`"What?`
` Didn't your dad tell you?!"`
`The priest answered the phone and I thought I told him to come pick it up...`
`Maybe I wasn't clear enough, or maybe he misunderstood me completely,`
` but she's here to eat the watermelon, not to take it home.`
`Besides, the small basket on Rika-chan's bicycle won't hold the watermelon`
` and it's too dangerous for her to ride while holding it in her hands.`
`"Mion, why don't you help Rika-chama take the watermelon?`
` There's no way she can ride her bicycle while carrying it."`
`"......Meep.`
` I can hold the watermelon."`
`"No, no, that's too dangerous!`
` If something happened to you, I wouldn't know what to say to Oyashiro-sama.`
` Mion will help you."`
`"Okay, okay, I will.`
` I'll go say hello to the priest too."`
`No matter whether she rides or pushes her bicycle, Rika-chan's hands will be occupied.`
`So I'm going to carry the watermelon.`
`The sky is turning auburn in the sunset.`
` The cool breeze feels good on my sandaled feet.`
`The plastic bag I'm carrying contains the watermelon`
` and also some small bags of rock candy.`
`If her mother finds them she'll take them away, so we decided to eat them before we got to her home. We opened the bags and enjoyed the rock candy.`
`Rika-chan isn't an exception.`
` Whenever kids from our neighborhood come to our house for errands, Granny gives them some treats.`
`Actually, that's a pretty common rule here in Hinamizawa.`
`It's funny, but sometimes when parents aren't watching, siblings will fight over who gets to take the circular notice to the next house over.`
`...So these bags of rock candy are like tips for them.`
`Of course, she doesn't normally give out this much.`
`Usually it's just a little piece of it.`
`...Granny is being extra nice to Rika-chama.`
`"......I feel bad getting all this candy."`
`"Don't worry.`
` Granny loves you.`
` You should just thank her and put a big smile on your face, that's all."`
`"...Do you get lots of treats?"`
`"Hmm, I used to!`
` But at this age, they don't give me any.`
` If they did though, I would probably feel I was being treated like a little kid."`
`"......Meep.`
` I'm being treated like a child then."`
`"Ahahahahaha, that's okay!`
` Enjoy it while you can.`
` When you become as old as me, you won't get any even if you wanted some."`
`As we talked about ordinary things, I noticed Rika-chan seemed a little sad.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"............Whenever I run errands, `
`I get candy as a treat.`
` But Satoko doesn't get any even if she comes with me."`
`"............"`
`I can think of so many reasons why.`
`Not only Satoko, but everyone in the Houjou family is being treated poorly in Hinamizawa.`
`And the Sonozaki family are the ones who instigated that.`
`The two dam supporters have died in an accident already.`
`But the malice against the Houjou family is still going.`
` It's directed against Satoko and Satoshi, their children,`
` and the aunt and uncle who are taking care of them.`
`The big fight between the Houjou family and the Sonozaki family at the explanatory meeting started all this.`
`But that was the Houjou couple, and it shouldn't have anything to do with the children and their aunt and uncle.`
`But the idea that "the Houjou family are traitors" evolved on its own. Therefore, anyone bearing the Houjou name is to be treated poorly.`
`The aunt and uncle weren't dam supporters.`
`So over time, the attacks towards them should have stopped.`
`...But they're rather odd`
` and they keep having trouble with their neighbors.`
`They don't follow the community rules, they don't do their community duties, and they spray pesticide while their neighbors' laundry is still hanging outside.`
`They often get into fights with the other villagers. They'd be hated even without the dam.`
`Therefore, the Houjou family continues to be treated poorly.`
`But none of that should have anything to do with Satoko and Satoshi.`
`Satoko and Satoshi are often depressed at school.`
`I tried to leave the conflict between the two families aside`
` but I wonder how they really feel about that.`
`From their point of view, I'm just another member of the family that keeps harassing them.`
`"I don't want any of that at school.`
` That's why I try to be their friend while we're there."`
`"...How can we get that to extend outside too, instead of staying in the school?"`
`......That'd be pretty difficult.`
`The Houjou family made enemies of the Three Families.`
`They were branded as traitors, and that's still considered the truth.`
`It wouldn't mean anything if one person suggested an end to the hostilities just because the events around the dam are history now.`
` On the contrary, that would just put them in the same position.`
`Unfortunately for Satoko and Satoshi,`
` the only thing they can do is to wait patiently until the issue withers away.`
`All I can do for them is provide an oasis until that day comes.`
`"......So how long do they have to wait?"`
`"I don't know.`
` The dam conflict lasted for several years.`
` They were branded back then, `
`so it might take years to clear up too."`
`"......Do you mean`
` they won't be forgiven until they become adults?`
` Will Satoko have to live out her childhood going through that?"`
`"That's`
` pretty miserable, isn't it..."`
`"......Mii,`
` we are their friends, aren't we?"`
`"Sure,`
` they're my friends.`
` We're all buddies."`
`"......Then isn't there something we can do to help our friends?"`
`"......What`
` exactly can we do?"`
`Even if the Sonozaki family declares that the dam conflict is over, so the Houjou family are no longer outcasts, that won't solve the problem.`
` It's not that simple.`
`In the first place, Granny hates the Houjou family and won't suffer their name to be mentioned in her presence.`
`It's not a matter of someone forgiving another.`
`It's a matter of very complicated ties between the people in this village.`
`It's absolutely terrifying to have them as your enemies.`
`Everyone knows that very well and that's why they maintain good relationships with their neighbors.`
`However if you make enemies out of them, you'll have to face the consequences.`
` That's the unwritten law of the Japanese community.`
`And the Sonozaki family is a part of this unwritten law.`
`Now that the Houjou family are outcasts, not even the Sonozaki family can overturn the situation.`
`"......So even if it's an issue of Hinamizawa, we can't do anything about it as Hinamizawa residents?"`
`".........Unfortunately... that's probably so, yeah.`
` If there's someone who can help Satoko, `
`that person must be someone who has nothing to do with the village.`
` But there's no one like that here."`
`"...Are you saying someone from the outside has to come help her?"`
`"............"`
`Like Rika-chan says, would a knight in shining armor from the outside world ever come here?`
` Would that person bring in a new wind into this village that has been filled with stale air for hundreds of years?`
`No way.`
` That's just wishful thinking.`
` Time will solve the problem someday...`
`Until then, I have to be their ally.`
`I can't think of anything else I can do for them.`
`As Rika-chan and I crunched on our rock candy, we can only pray that people will forgive Satoko and her family sooner rather than later...`
`Rika-chan gently broke the heavy silence.`
`"......I know."`
`"Eh?"`
`"......I know someone who has absolutely nothing to do with the village will come here from the outside."`
`"That's right.`
` The dam conflict is over, so it'd be great if more people moved into those lots that are for sale.`
` Wouldn't it be fun if a family with a kid our age moved in?"`
`"......He will come.`
` I know.`
` And we'll break this evil practice alongside him.`
` That will be the first key to one of the three locks that have us trapped in the past."`
`"......Eh?`
` What's this?`
` Are you talking about a novel or something?"`
`Rika-chan says some odd things sometimes.`
`When she talks that way, she seems so mature... I even start to doubt she's really younger than I am.`
`The unreasonable antagonism towards the Houjou family...`
`Will there really be someone from the outside who will shatter our old traditions?`
