`"So the dam construction will bring in new jobs and revitalize the local industry..."`
`"That's not what we're saying!!!"`
`"Who the hell gave you permission to build a dam here?"`
`"You squeeze tax money from us and this is what we get in return?`
` Who do you think pays your salaries, huh?"`
`"Look,`
` we're trying to explain to you..."`
`"We don't want to hear your excuses!! We want to know when you'll stop the construction!!!"`
`"You're useless! Bring the Minister of Construction here!!`
` He'll get to the bottom of it!!"`
`"Shut up, you yuppie!!"`
`"Hey, you're paid with our tax money, so why the hell are you talking down to us from up there?`
` Come down here and and let's speak face to face!!"`
`The auditorium is filled with angry shouting.`
`The sign at the entrance says`
` 'Hinamizawa Dam Construction Explanatory Meeting'.`
`Every time the official on the stage tried to say anything, the citizens packed into the room silenced him with their shouts.`
`Trying to ignore them, the official continued to explain the pros of the dam,`
` but that just further infuriated them.`
`Between the stage and the citizens, there was an open area where a police squad is standing by.`
`If they weren't there, the citizens would jump onto the stage and start a riot.`
`...I'm watching all this from the back of the auditorium.`
`It's obvious to anyone that they're being swallowed by their anger.`
`...They've become filled with a bloody red rage.`
` ...The anger that came from a certain purpose becomes a purpose in itself`
` and it creates a vicious cycle, where anger leads to more anger.`
`...Anger is a necessary emotion for humans.`
`People face many difficulties in their lives.`
`Anger gives them the motivation to fight and conquer such difficulties.`
`Therefore, anger is an essential part of life itself.`
`So I will never reject anger itself.`
`However, anger like this, that goes far beyond normal, makes people forget their purpose.`
`That is no longer an essential part of life.`
`As the blood rushes to their head, a person can't even remember what they've done. They go out of control.`
`......Such emotions are very painful, sad, and difficult to endure.`
`...I can clearly see the villagers who live alongside us turning into demons.`
`I understand the rules of the human world.`
`The power of an individual can't be compared to the power of the government.`
`To be able to fight, an individual needs to become part of a larger, unified power.`
`But to steer that unified power in the right direction is extremely difficult.`
`The cycle of anger leads to more anger.`
`Not anger that helps you live, but anger that exists only for anger.`
` ...It's just like being a demon.`
`And... this emotion is capable of violently rousing us from our long, peaceful slumber.`
`Everyone is immersed in their own anger.`
`We lived peacefully with the villagers while we slept quietly.`
`...Yet now we've awakened,`
` and it's like the world is trying to return to that age when demons were said to rise from Onigafuchi Swamp.`
`I keep shouting at everyone to get them to calm down.`
`But my voice can't reach them, because of the vicious cycle of anger.`
`Even so, I'll continue shouting, hoping even one of them will hear my voice.`
`Because if I don't do anything... the demons may awaken.`
`The demons that went into a deep sleep... may reawaken because of this commotion.`
`Then, all of a sudden, the atmosphere changed.`
`Looking up, I saw that the angry exchange between villagers and those on the podium had devolved into confrontation between the villagers themselves.`
` ...What's going on?`
`"Shut up!!!`
` Those are your reasons, not ours!! Don't pull us into this, you old hag!!"`
`"Who the hell cares!!`
` The hell you say, you bastard!!!"`
`"Hey, hey, hey!!`
` Do you know who you're talking to? This is Oryou-san. You've got some nerve, huh?`
` Who the hell do you think you are?"`
`"Shut up!!`
` Sonozaki? So what? I'm Houjou. Get your goons away from me!!"`
`"Hey, Houjou!!`
` How dare you say that you want the village to be submerged?`
` How much are they paying you?"`
`"Shut up, you old geezer!!`
` Listen, there are plenty of poor people in Hinamizawa. Not everyone is rich and has fields all over the mountains like you do!!`
`I'm satisfied with the compensation from the government. They've even offered to provide us with public housing.`
` Yet you're ruining everything, you assholes!!!`
` Don't pretend you're the same as us! `
`If you want to fight with the government, why don't you fight by yourself?`
` Then who's going to pay? You?`
` I'm poor and have two kids at home. `
`I was planning to start a new life by leaving here in peace after getting compensation from the government and finding a job elsewhere.`
` But you... since when did you represent me, huh?! `
`Do you think you're that important, or what?!"`
`"Hey, hey, hey, Houjou!!`
` How dare you betray us!!`
` Then get out! Get out of this village!!!"`
`"Sure, I'll be happy to!!`
` But you're going to pay what I'm entitled to, right?`
` You're going to pay me every yen of the compensation I was going to get from the government!! `
`Even if I wanted to leave the village, I don't have the money.`
` If you're going to pay me, I'll leave straight away!!"`
`"...Houjou is right!`
` There are plenty of residents who are willing to leave!`
` You Three Families shouldn't drag us into this!!"`
`"The hell is this?`
` Who just spoke?`
` Come on, who was it?"`
`"If you want to stay, then stay!!`
` We have the right to leave, so don't interfere!!"`
`"That's right!!`
` Back the hell off, you damn Sonozaki hag!!"`
`"...Ahh,`
` of course we'll compensate the people who support the dam construction plan.`
` We most certainly will not steal the land from you..."`
`"Shut up, government dog!!`
` Are you trying to divide the village?`
`Die, Houjou!!`
` You don't deserve to breathe the village air. Hold your breath and suffocate to death!!!"`
`"Screw you, old hag!!!`
` I'll murder your ass! Step up front, you damn hag!!!`
` Heeeey! Stay out of this, you fat pig!!"`
`"Veeeery good.`
` That was veeery good, Houjou.`
` I haven't been this pissed off in so, so long.`
` You'll get what you deserve!!`
` Look forward to it!!"`
`"Get 'em, get 'em, Houjou!!`
` The government has to provide us new jobs, shelter, and compensation."`
`"Hey, hey!!`
` Stop this violence!!`
` All of you, stop it, stop it!!!"`
`"Like hell, bring it on!!`
` Come and get some!!"`
`Everyone is being tainted with the bloody red anger...`
`And I can only watch......`
`The least I can do...`
` is to apologize for the tragedy`
` that is about to happen...`
`...I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry.`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry,`
` I'm sorry...`
`This...... is how things started.`
`From this day onward, the Houjou family and the Sonozaki family will wage a feud against each other, and the Houjou family will become ostracized within the village.`
`This marks the beginning of Satoko and Satoshi's lives of tremendous hardship.`
