`Mion, having turned red, insisted that the cute doll would be a much better fit for Rena.`
`Her attitude made it clear that she really wanted the doll, but couldn't be honest about it.`
`"I just...`
` This ol' man just thinks that...`
` cute dolls like this are...`
` more for girly girls, you know...?`
`This doll doesn't deserve to be owned by a tomboy like me... Ahahahahaha!"`
`"I know that you want it!`
` It's written all over your face!`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"No!`
` It's not written on my face!`
` You're lying! Stop being mean!"`
`Mion shook her head with an embarrassed look, pretending she wasn't interested in the doll.`
`Everyone here knew that she wanted it.`
`We all looked at Mion with big smiles on our faces.`
`"Hey, it's not like I can only give this doll to a girl!`
` Just think of it as my gift to you, as a friend!"`
`"I-Is that so?`
` So you would give a doll to a boy too?"`
`"Well... I would choose something else if I had a choice...`
`But anyway, guys would never reject a gift unless there's something shady going on.`
` It's just me being generous... Why would you refuse it?!"`
`"Oh...`
` So I can accept this doll... even though I'm not a girly girl...?"`
`Everyone thought Mion's reaction was hilarious.`
`Rena couldn't stop chuckling.`
` Satoko and I burst out laughing too.`
`Mion, having realized she was being laughed at, got even more embarrassed.`
`"I'm offering this to you as a friend!`
` I don't want to hear that you're not cherishing it!"`
`"O...`
` okay...`
` Umm...`
` This ol' man just wants to make it clear that he's not accepting this because he wants this doll!`
`He's taking it because you said it's a gift from you as a friend...`
` He's taking it as a courtesy so he doesn't disrespect your generosity!"`
`Hanyuu was cracking up too.`
`She was laughing in a loud voice, knowing that no one could hear her anyway.`
`But was this really a good way to resolve the problem...?`
`I thought that Mion's issue in the previous life was that she <i>wanted</i> Keiichi to treat her like a girl...`
`She got the doll, but Keiichi still wasn't treating her that way...`
`Still, Mion looked very happy. Maybe it wasn't a big deal after all.`
`I'm sure that Mion will take that doll with her to bed tonight.`
`She'll kiss it good night, too.`
` I could bet on that.`
` It was written all over her face.`
`"She's finally accepted it.`
` It was a challenge just for me to give her a doll."`
`Keiichi turns around to face us, smiling bitterly.`
`"Ahahahaha, you did it though!"`
`"......Yup. It was perfect.`
` I'm impressed that you managed it."`
`"Mion-san was hilarious!`
` It was obvious the moment you looked that she really wanted the doll!"`
`"Isn't that the truth!`
` Ahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Hey, you guys!`
` Are you saying rude things about this ol' man?`
` Knock it off already!"`
`"Don't you have to get to work?`
` You're going to be late."`
`"You guys better watch yourselves!"`
`Mion seemed like she wanted to stay longer, but after looking at her watch she started heading to work.`
`Everyone was wearing smiles on their faces.`
` Today was such a fun day.`
`Everyone had lots of fun, and no one was hurt.`
`I've repeated this same day so many times before.`
` But this time, something was different...`
`It's like I rolled a die and got a six...`
` and then I rolled it again, and got a six again.`
`I don't know if this was just a lucky coincidence, or if it was meant to be.`
`It's as if the god of fate is celebrating my motivation to fight against him...`
