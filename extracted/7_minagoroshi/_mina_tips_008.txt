`"Please hold on a moment, I'll get her... Oryou-san, someone from the municipal government is calling..."`
`"...Aah, hello?"`
`"Hello, Sonozaki-san. This is Aida from the municipal government.`
` Thank you very much for the ohagi the other day."`
`"You're quite welcome. Thank you for your work at the culture festival.`
` Also for providing that large parasol.`
` How much does that thing cost?`
` We use it every year, so we might as well buy one ourselves."`
`"We borrowed that one from a teacher. I checked out the price, but the domestically-made ones cost about 200,000 yen.`
` I also found one made in China, and it's less than half the price..."`
`"I don't care if it's made in China or not. Just get one so we don't have to cause any more trouble for the teachers."`
`"We're actually ordering it already. Once it arrives, you might want to take a look at it and make a final decision..."`
`"Also, we've been holding the same Edo-style tea ceremony for the past three years. We should probably get an instructor from a different style.`
` Can you look for a new instructor for next year?"`
`"O-Oh... I see... W-Will do, ma'am!`
` We'll find a different tea ceremony instructor.`
` ...About that, Advisor.`
` I had something else to ask you about."`
`"And here's me going on about a parasol. So, what do you need?"`
`"We were wondering if you've heard anything about the case of Satoko Houjou-san in Hinamizawa."`
`"...Satoko Houjou? Haaah?`
` You're talking about that blasted Houjou girl?`
` What did she do?"`
`"Well... She's recently moved in with her uncle,`
` but she's being abused, apparently... have you heard anything about it?"`
`"Her uncle? Satoko's being abused?`
` I've never heard of anything like that!"`
`"Oh, well, if you don't know, that's okay. To tell you the truth, someone from Hinamizawa came to petition to the child consultation center.`
` According to the center, that petitioner was very persistent. `
`The manager felt that it was better to talk with you, if you already knew about it..."`
`"I don't know anything, and I don't care! Why would I do anything for that pitiful child?!`
` The Sonozaki family has nothing to do with this!!"`
`"Have you heard anything about it from the town council...?"`
`"No, no!! What are you saying?!`
` If Kimiyoshi was helping that blasted Houjou child, then the Sonozaki family would know about it!!`
` Who is petitioning the child consultation center?!"`
`"I heard some of her classmates were there... Well, as far as I know, anyway. ...I guess it's just something that her classmates are doing, and the village has nothing to do with it?"`
`"Of course not!! I don't know anything!!`
` The village has nothing to do with Satoko!!"`
`The contents of this conversation were forwarded to the child consultation center.`
`If Oryou wasn't behind the commotion, then they had no need to take the case seriously.`
`The manager told his staff to listen to what the petitioners have to say,`
` but to never say anything promising the girl's safety.`
`"Keiichi Maebara-kun, huh?`
` I guess a boy like that will grow up to be a political advocate in the future!"`
