`"I'm getting hungry.`
` Want to grab something on the way?"`
`"Ah, that's right.`
` It's almost 8 PM.`
` We had a late lunch today, so I didn't realize.`
` We can go get something after we finish hearing her story."`
`"You've sent four officers there...`
` They're probably pretty worn out by now. `
`Hopefully Furude-san ordered them something to eat."`
`Ooishi and Kumagai had passed through Okinomiya and were getting closer and closer to Hinamizawa.`
`They hurried on their way, driving through the dark streets.`
`"I wonder what Rika Furude wants to talk to you about..."`
`"Probably something outrageous.`
` ...That village, you know, used to be called Onigafuchi Village.`
` They took the name Onigafuchi, the 'Demon's Abyss', from the local swamp."`
`"And like an abyss, it's hard to know its depth, huh?`
` ...What are you planning to do about her protection?"`
`"Depending on what she tells us, we might have to move her to a safer location.`
` The whole of Hinamizawa is like a lion's den.`
` You never know what can happen in that village. `
`For now, we just need to hear what she has to say."`
`"The head of the Furude family is in danger, and the successor of the Sonozaki family is trying to protect her.`
` ...Who would even be capable of killing Rika Furude under those circumstances? `
`The only people I can think of are the Kimiyoshi family."`
`"I've never heard of them getting up to anything fishy...`
` I guess there must be a fanatical religious sect lurking in the village...`
` I wonder what secret lies at the bottom of that swamp."`
`The road they were on was cutting through the rice fields.`
`...Leading them to pass by the scene of Jirou Tomitake's murder.`
`"Takano left Tomitake there.`
` I'm sure of that, but I wonder what he actually died of.`
` Forensics didn't find any drugs in his system, did they?"`
`"They didn't find anything, but that doesn't prove it either way.`
` There are hundreds of strange chemicals in this world.`
` There's no proof that a drug wasn't used.`
` It must just be one that we're not aware of. `
`I'm sure of that.`
`There must be some kind of drug out there that can make someone claw out their throat and die.`
` I'm going to grill the culprit about it once I make the arrest. `
`Of course, it would be easier if that's what Rika Furude is going to tell me.`
` ...Kuma-chan, you must have learned exactly how false charges are made, seeing what happened in Gifu today."`
`"Hahahaha. That was horrible.`
` If that guy was at our station, I'd never forgive him."`
`"He flat out refused to admit he made a mistake.`
` The Gifu police department as a whole is still convinced that the body belongs to Miyo Takano.`
` But we'll operate under the assumption that she lives. `
`The top of the department will make the final decision.`
` It's obvious that they made a simple mistake.`
` They're just desperately covering it up because they'll be in trouble if they admit it. `
`They really need to rethink their attitude."`
`The car suddenly shook.`
`The concrete road had ended, leaving only gravel.`
`At the point where the gravel road begins, you're officially in Hinamizawa.`
`They continued to drive through the woods for a while.`
`"......Kuma-chan.`
` Stop the car!"`
`"What?"`
`Ooishi had told him to stop immediately.`
`Kumagai quickly slammed on the brakes.`
`Their seatbelts tightened up, keeping them in their seats.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"...That car over there... I wonder what it's doing."`
`Ooishi tapped on the rearview mirror.`
` There was a van parked just off the road.`
`Rather beat up, it looked like it was used for a private company.`
`There was no reason for someone to park their car here, especially at this time of night.`
` ...Kumagai also thought it looked suspicious.`
`The car seemed empty, but there was a light flashing in the woods nearby.`
`...Probably a flashlight.`
`"Strange that a van is out here at this hour.`
` I'm surprised you even saw it."`
`"It's like I keep telling you.`
` A detective always has to pay attention to his surroundings.`
` ...I wonder what he's doing there.`
` Is he dumping something illegally?`
` Is he dumping someone's body? `
`Maybe it's a pair of lovebirds on a secret date?`
` Well, that can't be it, judging by the van.`
` ...Hello, Okinomiya Security? Do you read me?`
` Na ha ha, good evening, and good night."`
`"This is Okinomiya Security. Reading you loud and clear."`
`"I need a license number scanned.`
` XX XX-XXXX."`
`"That's XX XX-XXXX?`
` It might take a while."`
`"We'll wait."`
`"Ooishi-san, according to this map, there's a facility of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation here."`
`"What in the world is a 'facility' of the NTT?"`
`It was listed as a facility, but it wasn't staffed; it was just a place where machines were installed.`
`Kumagai wasn't sure how telephone lines actually work, but either way it seemed like some kind of connecting device was located there.`
`"But that's just an ordinary van.`
` It doesn't look like it belongs to the NTT."`
`"If it is them, shouldn't their name be on the van...?"`
`"...Maybe some other company is contracted to do it.`
` Anyway, we should just go and ask."`
`Ooishi wasn't sure if that was the case.`
`After all, why would any phone company go to do maintenance so late at night?`
`"Let's go and check what's going on.`
` Furude-san is waiting for us, so we need to be fast."`
`"Yes sir."`
`His well-honed detective instinct was trying to tell him something.`
`This feeling wasn't one that Ooishi could easily explain.`
` He has a strong sense that something was suspicious, without any real reasoning behind it.`
`...Ooishi trusted that he could judge others' character with that sense.`
`"Kshh...h... ...Nightingale 2 to Nightingale 1.`
` A vehicle has stopped nearby.`
` Two people got out.`
` ......They're probably police officers.`
` They're approaching and will make contact in less than a minute."`
`It was pitch-black, yet they could see the two newcomers clearly.`
`They were probably using a night vision scope.`
`"Roger.`
` Attention, all units.`
` Nightingales 2 through 5, wait for the green light.`
` Nightingales 7 and 8, make sure the surrounding 100m are clear."`
`"Roger.`
` Nightingale 4 and 5, do you copy?"`
`"Nightingale 4, roger."`
`"Nightingale 5, roger."`
`"Nightingale 7, roger."`
`"Nightingale 8, roger."`
`"This is Nightingale from HQ, Nightingale from HQ...`
` There's been some trouble during the modification of the phone facility.`
` They're two police detectives.`
` We request clearance to open fire."`
`"Roger. Wait for the order."`
`By the time Ooishi and Kumagai reached the phone facility, they were being watched from all directions.`
`There were two pairs of binoculars`
` and two sniper rifles pointing at them.`
`The Mountain Dog operatives worked in two-man units, a sniper and spotter, to secure the means of retreat.`
`They had all taken different positions, so that they could shoot Ooishi no matter where he tried to run.`
`They were all in camouflage suits, hiding deep in the woods.`
`Ooishi, of course, had no chance of spotting them.`
`The snipers had their rifles trained on the detectives' heads.`
`...Ooishi and Kumagai had no idea...`
` that they were on the verge of losing their very lives.`
`The snipers' rifles had their safeties on, but a flick of their thumbs would release them.`
`In other words, they were ready to shoot if given the order...`
`The detectives found the fenced-in machinery right behind the parked van.`
`There was a sign there saying that it was the property of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, and another sign warning people to keep away.`
`"Hello~ Good evening~"`
`"...Sorry, but could you step back? We're in middle of a maintenance operation."`
`There were four men working there, wearing blue overalls.`
`They had a toolbox open, and were working on some wires.`
`"Sorry to interrupt.`
`We're from the police.`
` We were wondering what you guys were doing, since it's pretty strange to see a van parked out here."`
`"Good evening, officers.`
` We're almost finished here."`
`"Who are you guys?`
` You're not from the NTT, are you?"`
`"Oh, we're not, no.`
` We're from Okonogi Electrics.`
` ...Huh?`
` Oh, sorry, I'm out of business cards."`
`"Okonogi Electrics... Where's your office located?"`
`"...Er?`
` Well, it's in Okinomiya..."`
`"Could you give me the phone number and address of your office?"`
`"...W... Why do you want to know?"`
`"...........`
` You forgot`
` the telephone number?"`
`Ooishi looked at them with a piercing glare.`
`Their response was very suspicious.`
`Usually, the vehicle of an electric company is full of various types of electrical equipment and repair tools.`
`However, the van parked there had nothing inside, and it looked just like an ordinary car.`
`Also, a company vehicle usually has the name of the company painted on it.`
` ...But this one was just a plain van with no markings on it.`
`None of that was the reason that Ooishi found them suspicious, though.`
`It was their attitude that bothered him.`
` They didn't sound nor look like typical contractors.`
` They were obviously not electricians.`
`It was far too late in the day, and there were far too many of them.`
`They were also clearly suspicious of Ooishi.`
`However, that was all he could tell just by looking around.`
`He found them suspicious, but had no idea what they were up to.`
`One of the men told Ooishi the phone number.`
`Kumagai wrote down the number so he could ask the station to call and confirm it was real.`
`"We're not doing anything suspicious..."`
`"Na ha ha ha!`
` You guys are very suspicious!`
` Who are you?`
`If you're really a contractor, you should have proof of that.`
` But you don't have anything.`
` Besides, everything about you seems off."`
`"...Officer... please don't cause us any trouble...`
` Just leave us alone. We need to finish up our job here..."`
`Judging from their progress, it didn't look like they'd be cleaning up any time soon.`
`In fact, it almost seemed like they were just getting started.`
`"Nfu fu fu!`
` It's pretty obvious that you're lying, son.`
` You should have studied the role a little better if you wanted to pretend to be an electrician."`
`Ooishi raised his voice threateningly.`
`The members of the Mountain Dogs gradually started to look more and more annoyed...`
`Ooishi looked over their expressions`
` and gave them a big wide grin.`
`However, Ooishi had no idea.`
`He thought he could handle these suspicious people with no issues.`
`Of course, in reality, they were horrific demons that he had no chance against.`
`Meanwhile, Kumagai was heading back to the car.`
` He was intending to contact the police department.`
`He was going to call the station using the radio.`
` Then, in turn, the police department would contact the NTT.`
` ......That way, it would become clear who they were really dealing with.`
`"HQ to Nightingale 1.`
` You have permission to fire."`
`"Nightingale 7, clear."`
`"Nightingale 8, clear."`
`The sniper was still aiming at Kumagai's head as he headed back toward their car.`
`The safety, that last line protecting Kumagai's life, was disengaged.`
`The sniper put his finger on the trigger.`
`He was wearing a glove with the fingertips cut out.`
`The finger poking through the hole was very rough and merciless.`
`For as soon as he slightly moved that finger, he would take someone's life.`
`"Nightingale 1 to sniper team, all green."`
`Kumagai heard a quiet noise.`
`It was similar to the sound of the jump rope that he used to use as a whip when he was little.`
`...And that was the last thought Kumagai had in this world.`
`Kumagai collapsed onto the gravel.`
` That was it.`
` He didn't even twitch.`
`".........Ugh... Agh! ...Ooooooh..."`
`Ooishi was laying on his back on the concrete after getting shot in the chest.`
`His lungs were filled with blood, which began to pour out of his mouth.`
`...Ooishi only realized that he'd been shot when the world began to blur before his eyes...`
`As his world keeled over, he saw a man in a work uniform leveling a gun at him, but it didn't matter anymore as he started drowning on his own blood...`
`"This is Okinomiya Security.`
` We've scanned the license plate number.`
` ...............Detective Ooishi?`
` ...............Detective Ooishi, please come in.`
` ...............Huh? `
`.........Did we lose the signal or something............?`
` ...Detective Ooishi, come in............"`
`"He's not answering."`
`"Ooishi-san wanted a plate number scanned?`
` Whose car is it?"`
`"It's just a villager's car.`
` ...No one special."`
`"...Who is it?`
` It must be someone suspicious if Ooishi-san is asking about them."`
`"It really seems like nobody out of the ordinary.`
` No accidents...`
` No tickets..."`
`"Ha ha ha... He probably got pissed off after that car passed him or something.`
` He can be a pretty stubborn guy sometimes."`
`"This is Nightingale...`
` Both targets eliminated.`
` Resuming the mission."`
`"Roger.`
` Be sure to dispose of their vehicle.`
` Major, Nightingale just terminated two officers. They're resuming their mission."`
`"...Sweet dreams, Ooishi-san.`
` Too bad, he was getting so close to catching me.`
` Hee hee hee hee...`
` ......Can I get a cup of coffee?"`
`"Absolutely.`
` This is getting complicated.`
` There are still several officers at R's house, and her friends are there as well.`
` R must know that she's getting murdered tonight.`
` Someone is leaking information. `
`I think we should postpone the plan."`
`"We have to have her corpse by tomorrow.`
` That's what's most convenient for the people in charge.`
` We have to execute this mission tonight."`
`The crucial part of this final mission was the death of Rika and what came after that.`
`They couldn't just kill her whenever they wanted.`
` Doing it at the right time was vital.`
`"Maybe she's panicking at the Dogs' excessive security?"`
`"......No.`
` ...It's not that information is being leaked.`
` She's predicting it.`
` She knew that Tomitake was going to die, and she even knew how my body was going to be found...`
` She's the queen. `
`She's the genuine heir to the blood of Oyashiro-sama, her priestess, and the queen positioned at the top of Hinamizawa's supernatural phenomena.`
` It's impossible to hide things from God. `
`Assassinating Rika Furude won't be so easy. ...Hee hee. All right, Rika-chan.`
`Let's see which of us deserves to inherit the legend of Oyashiro-sama.`
` Your death will be the final curse of Oyashiro-sama, and it will mark the finale of this legendary village. `
`When that happens, my plan will become the real curse.`
` Hee hee hee hee!"`
`It was now past 8 PM.`
`Mion ordered some noodles for us. Her treat.`
`We also ordered some food for the four officers, and we all ate together.`
`We were supposed to call it a night as soon as we talked to Ooishi, but he's still not here.`
`However, we all took it easy, assuming that they'd get here sooner or later.`
`It's getting late.`
`Once you get to Hinamizawa, there aren't many places to get something to eat.`
` I'm sure they're having a quick dinner before coming here.`
`However, the four officers seem anxious.`
`They all had families, but Ooishi didn't tell them how late they'd have to be out here.`
`They're hoping that Ooishi will bring other officers to relieve them so they can go home.`
`They called the station, but all they said was that Ooishi was on his way,`
` and we should wait, because he'll be here soon.`
`"......That Ooishi sure is late."`
`"I'm sure he's stuck in traffic.`
` It's still rush hour..."`
`"Those officers have been here since this afternoon, right?`
` They must be tired by now..."`
`"I know.`
` It sucks that they don't even know when they can go home."`
`"Should we patrol outside so they can get some rest?`
` We can have Satoko set up some traps to prevent strangers from coming in here."`
`"Oh ho ho!`
` Good thinking, Shion-san!`
` However, just think... this is our house.`
` We already have several traps set up around this place!"`
`"R-Really?`
` We should be careful when we're around here..."`
`With our stomachs full, the mood in the house had returned to a lighthearted one.`
`True, we shouldn't be so relaxed, but knowing that Ooishi would be here shortly made us feel relieved.`
`...But he's so late.`
`He said he'd be here in an hour.`
`Mion mentioned he might have gotten stuck in traffic.`
`But I'm sure Ooishi was considering that.`
` That's why he told me it'd take him about an hour.`
`And it had now been one hour since the time Ooishi was supposed to get here.`
`......I want to believe that he's getting something to eat on the way, but I'm starting to get concerned.`
`Ooishi still hasn't shown up.`
` It's almost eleven o'clock.`
`The officers are completely exhausted.`
`They had even started to smoke cigarettes outside.`
`My friends are becoming tired, too.`
`Satoko is yawning.`
`It's way past our bedtime.`
`Everyone else is getting tired and sleepy. We've been spending our time watching TV and reading manga.`
`I can feel my fear succumbing to sleepiness.`
`Today is almost over.`
` I'm going to survive the day I'm supposed to die.`
`Does that mean that I escaped my deadly fate?`
`No... I'll have to fight endlessly from tomorrow on.`
`...I was going to discuss that with Ooishi.`
`Since he's not here, I don't know what to do from this point on...`
`Suddenly, the phone rang, breaking the silence.`
`"Is that Ooishi-san?"`
`"......Hello... This is the Furude residence..."`
`"I'm sorry to call you this late. This is Komiyama calling from the Okinomiya police department.`
` By any chance, is Detective Ooishi there with you?"`
`"...No.`
` We've been waiting for him for a long time."`
`"I see...`
` We'll send out more officers, so will you tell the ones there to leave once their relief comes?"`
`"...Okay, I'll do that.`
` ....So, where is Ooishi...?"`
`"We got a call from him this evening saying he was heading there directly, so we thought he'd be with you already. `
`The officers were supposed to return after Ooishi arrived, but they haven't come back, so we were wondering what was going on."`
`That's what I'd like to know, but arguing with the man on the phone wouldn't accomplish anything.`
`I hung up and gave the message to the officers downstairs.`
`It looked like everyone already heard our exchange on the phone.`
`"I wonder what's going on...`
` He's way too late..."`
`"Maybe he ran into some important case that he had to take care of."`
`"He would have called us if so.`
` He told us that he was on his way.`
` I think he'd call us if something was going on..."`
`"Was he attacked by Tokyo...?"`
`"No way... ahahahahaha!`
`But... If they're really as scary as Rika-chama told us... that might be possible."`
`"...He probably had something to take care of.`
` I bet he forgot to call us.`
` Remember, he's a tough guy!`
` No one can take him down that easily!"`
`"I do hope he gets here soon...`
` Haaaaaaaw......."`
`Satoko yawned.`
`Everyone laughs, but some of them are trying not to yawn themselves.`
`We can't stay up forever.`
`We decided that we'd call it a night once the replacement officers arrived.`
`I'm sure I've survived past the time I was supposed to die.`
`That's probably because the police were protecting me.`
`Perhaps both Takano and the Mountain Dogs are also on my side, and they took care of the murderer...`
`I don't know who is changing my fate...`
`Maybe my fate hasn't been changed, and I'm going to get killed soon anyway.`
`I don't know if it's because of the police or because of the Mountain Dogs, but the only thing I know for sure is that I'm still alive.`
`Soon, I heard the noise of someone walking on the gravel on the shrine grounds.`
`One of my friends suggested that it might be Ooishi, but I doubt it.`
`I don't want to expect him and be disappointed when it's not...`
` I'm starting to think like Hanyuu.`
`"Good evening. I'm Komiyama,`
` I'm from the Okinomiya police department."`
`It wasn't Ooishi. Two of his fellow detectives had arrived instead.`
`They were going to stay downstairs and have the four officers return home.`
`They also told my friends to leave.`
`"We'll stay here to protect her, so please go home.`
` Your families must be worried about you."`
`"......Thank you so much, everyone.`
` The detectives are here, so I'm okay now."`
`"Are you sure?`
` We'll stay here tonight if you like."`
`"......I'm fine.`
` Besides, I don't have any extra pajamas and blankets for you guys."`
`"See you tomorrow, then.`
` We'll try and stay with you as much as we can from now on.`
` How about we do club activities here, after school?"`
`"That would be wonderful!"`
`"......Meep.`
` My floor might break with all these people here."`
`"Wa ha ha ha! It might really break!"`
`"Well Rika-chama.`
` We're going home now, but be careful.`
` Do not go out alone in the dark under any circumstances."`
`"......I'll be careful."`
`"All right.`
` See you tomorrow."`
`"...Yes.`
` See you tomorrow."`
`See you tomorrow.`
` ...Am I really going to see them tomorrow...?`
` ...I have no clue.`
`I've tried so many things over the past one hundred years.`
`I've done many things, and I have memories of most of them.`
`That's why I feel so scared on the day I die... it's the only day that I have no memory of.`
`I don't even know if I'm approaching or escaping my death right now.`
`All I know is that this fear is going to continue until I find some kind of solution...`
`As I started getting ready to go to bed, Satoko suggested that I should sleep in my regular clothes, rather than in my pajamas.`
`She was thinking that I should remain dressed, just in case someone tries to attack me in my sleep.`
`It sounded ridiculous, but she was just trying to be considerate.`
` I decided to do what she told me to.`
`Satoko seemed so sleepy until a few minutes ago, but she suddenly started passionately explaining to me all the traps she set on the shrine grounds. `
`She assured me that strangers will end up trapped if they tried to sneak inside this building.`
`To someone else, it might sound like she was just trying to brag, but Satoko was trying to make me feel better.`
`......After everyone else left, she noticed how scared I looked.`
`Satoko's kindness, and everyone else's kindness.`
`I feel it was the right decision for me to talk to my friends.`
`Even if that won't end up changing my fate.`
`"............Rika."`
`Hanyuu showed up again.`
`She looked upset, so she was probably still thinking that I could get killed at any minute.`
`But I'm actually starting to feel a little better...`
`I might get killed tomorrow, but I feel like I can rest safely at least tonight.`
`I'm more concerned about the fact that Ooishi didn't show up.`
`Still, even if he didn't, the other detectives are here, and will stay on guard downstairs without sleeping.`
`As long as they're here, I think I'll be safe tonight.`
`"...What's wrong?`
` Are you hungry?`
` I didn't eat anything sweet today.`
` Do you want me to drink some juice?"`
`Hanyuu would usually cheer right up when I suggested drinking some juice...`
` but not this time.`
`Her face looked pale...`
` as if she wasn't`
` even alive.`
` Something out of the ordinary had clearly happened.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`".........It's almost time."`
`That sounded far more like a declaration than a prediction.`
`Even Hanyuu doesn't have any memories of my death.`
`There's no way she can tell when I will be killed.`
` ......However, she sounded so certain just now.`
`Perhaps... we can feel it in the very cells of our body.`
`Our bodies understand fate far better than we do.`
`Up until now I felt reassured, that we could get through it somehow if we're all together. `
`But as I clung to that life preserver with a hole leaking air... I was starting to drown in a sea of despair, and struggling to keep my head above water.`
`No, I can't let myself feel that way...!!`
` I have to believe!`
`"...It's okay, Hanyuu.`
` ...I'm going to fight.`
` Even if I get killed tomorrow, I'm not going to die tonight...!"`
`"............."`
`Hanyuu just gave me a look of faint sadness.`
`That silence told me that my pitiful hope was going to push me down into a futile reality.`
`I stared at Satoko as she continued to brag about her traps.`
`...If I'm getting killed shortly, Satoko won't be safe either.`
` I quickly interrupted her talk about traps.`
