`Irie turned the light on as soon as he finished his presentation.`
`There were about eight men wearing lab coats inside the meeting room.`
`The man sitting at the far end was the only person without one.`
`Upon seeing Irie finish his speech, he clapped his hands several times.`
`Having noticed his applause, the other men in the room soon followed suit.`
`"Excellent.`
` Very, very excellent.`
` I'm quite satisfied with your progress."`
`"Your hard work has paid off, Dr. Irie."`
`"No, I would say it's because of my incredible staff.`
` I really do owe them my gratitude."`
`"We really are getting close to finding a perfect cure.`
` There are a few more sticking points left, but they can all be resolved with time and financing."`
`"We're counting on your support on that front.`
` With sufficient funding and labor, I estimate we'll be done within three years.`
` By 1986 we should be able to establish a complete treatment for it. `
`From here on out, our challenges are establishing a treatment package that other, unspecialized medical facilities can easily administer, and developing an easier, cheaper test for it."`
`"With regards to testing, Dr. Irie is currently researching ways to detect potential patients through blood samples. `
`Once that process is established, the test can be administered alongside regular physical exams, and we believe that will drive costs down significantly."`
`"That's wonderful to hear.`
` The current tests are pretty involved and expensive, after all.`
` ...Sorry, I'm truly grateful to hear you're considering the costs too. `
`Healthy citizens are supposed to be our nation's assets, so it really is shameful to bring up the budget, but...`
` But from our position, we'd like to shave every yen we can off the costs."`
`"Of course. We understand.`
` If we established a treatment that was impossible due to the cost, it'd just be a pie in the sky.`
` It's our job to develop a practical treatment, not a theoretical one."`
`Tomitake started clapping again, and everyone followed him.`
`"You're truly a respectable man, as well as a talented doctor.`
` I'm honored to have met you."`
`"No, I can't sincerely accept your applause until every person has been treated, and this so-called 'curse of Oyashiro-sama' has been exterminated.`
` We hope for your continued cooperation until that time."`
`"Likewise!`
` I'll do everything I can to make sure you receive almost every yen in the budget you've outlined.`
` Please keep up the good work!"`
`Tomitake and Irie shook hands,`
`and the meeting room was filled with applause yet again.`
`"That's it for tonight's meeting.`
` Tomorrow's the main event we're all waiting for... the budget hearing.`
` Let's all push hard."`
`Takano was being sarcastic, of course.`
` The staff members in lab coats were smiling bitterly.`
`"...Ahahahaha.`
` Well, I'll give my greatest efforts for the budget you all need too.`
`To be honest, I want to be on your side myself... `
`But I'm the one who has to explain things to the brass, and the one they come down on directly...`
`You have my deepest apologies, but regretfully, I'll be rigorously examining the budget. `
`Please continue lending me your cooperation."`
`"Ha ha ha. That's your job, so we can't blame you.`
` We'll see you tomorrow.`
` In any case, that's it for today."`
`Once Irie declared the meeting over, his white-coated staff gathered up their documents and left after glancing at the clock.`
`...It was almost midnight.`
`The staff who were off tomorrow might be alright, but those scheduled to work needed to sleep soon, or it would hinder them the next day.`
`Takano gathered up the butts from the ashtrays as well as the empty coffee cans.`
`"My, some people didn't drink their coffee.`
`We managed to get a coffee budget for meetings approved, but I wonder if they'll cut that budget if people don't drink it.`
` Hee hee..."`
`"Ahahaha... Don't be so mean.`
` I'm not doing this because I enjoy it, you know?"`
`"Oh, Takano-san...`
` I'll take that leftover coffee."`
`"I'll take one too.`
` That way the budget won't go to waste."`
`"Ha ha ha ha ha!"`
`The two of them seemed more relaxed with the other staff members gone.`
`Tomitake and Irie loosened their collars in a sign of relief.`
`"How are Rika-chan and Satoko-chan? Are they doing fine?`
`I heard last week that Satoko-chan's test results weren't that good recently..."`
`"No, but it actually wasn't that big of a deal.`
` She was a bit out of sorts because of the heat wave.`
` Her new results came out very stable."`
`"Hee hee, Dr. Irie is very passionate about Satoko-chan..."`
`"Th-Th-That's not true.`
` As a physician, I treat all of my patients equally, to the best of my ability!`
`But if she feels grateful and decides to become my maid, that would be wonderful! `
`...Though that's proving quite difficult."`
`"It would be wonderful if there was a way to completely cure Satoko-chan.`
` ...But I guess that's what's difficult?"`
`"...Once a patient reaches the L5 state like Satoko-chan has, it's easy for them to re-experience hallucinations, similar to a patient suffering from flashbacks. `
`Those technically aren't caused by the disease, but by the normal defense mechanisms cultivated in the brain. `
`Like the idiom, 'a scalded dog fears cold water' suggests, the brain naturally uses past experiences proactively for our survival."`
`"In simpler terms, emotional trauma.`
` Worse yet, we suspect she may have suffered damage directly to her frontal lobe, so she needs more delicate counseling and long-term medication than the usual trauma patient."`
`"You may be able to treat her illness, but you can't treat her mental health...`
` is that what you are saying?"`
`"...There are plenty of people functioning in society with emotional trauma.`
` Even if she's just one more to the mix, that's still a miraculous recovery considering the state she used to be in..."`
`"Think about diabetic patients.`
` There's no cure, but many of them live happily by managing their condition."`
`"She still needs three shots a day...?"`
`"No, she's recovered quite a bit, so she's down to twice a day now.`
` I think that puts a lot less strain on her too."`
`"She was so afraid in the beginning...`
` But Rika-chan talked her into it."`
`"Into getting the shots, you mean?"`
`"Satoko-chan was told that she's receiving financial support from us by supporting our research."`
`"So she thinks that she's getting two shots a day not because she's sick...`
` but as a test subject for your research?"`
`"Jirou-san.`
` ......It would be a horrible thing for us to explain to her what kind of illness she's suffering from...`
` Didn't I tell you this before?"`
`"...Ah, well.`
` I remember.`
` Sorry for being insensitive..."`
`"...If you happen to see Satoko-chan somewhere, please be kind to her."`
`"All right.`
` ...I will."`
`"Rika-chan is such a strong girl...`
`Her background is similar to Satoko-chan's, yet she's leading such a steady life."`
`"We have Rika-chan and her deceased parents to thank for all of this.`
` Without their understanding and support, we would've never discovered even a hint at a cure so soon."`
`"......She even endured our inhumane experiments very well.`
` We wouldn't have the results we do today without her support after overcoming her parents' death.`
`...I'd like to repay the debt we owe her somehow."`
`"I agree.`
` Tokyo also recognizes that Rika-chan and Satoko-chan have rendered us a distinguished service.`
` They will be compensated for their work someday."`
`"Hey, you guys don't even want to pay for our coffee filters!`
` Hee hee."`
`"Again, don't be mean.`
` You keep bringing that story up..."`
`"Ha ha ha ha ha."`
`"But even though all we can do is to compensate them with money...`
` I wish there was a way to pay them back from our hearts..."`
`Takano muttered like she's talking to herself, but it almost sounded as if she was talking to them.`
`"...I'm sure there are many ways for us to show our appreciation.`
` There are many ways we can pay them back."`
`"Dr. Irie...`
` I mean, Coach. I guess you're already doing that for them all the time.`
` I suppose I should be nice to those girls too."`
`"Indeed. Plus, Rika-chan was very nice to you today."`
`"Aaah, I nearly forgot!`
` I have to take that film to get developed first thing in the morning!`
` It was such a wonderful experience...`
` History,`
` culture,`
` the smell of it...`
` Everything about it was wonderful!"`
`Irie wondered what she could have experienced during the day.`
` Tomitake could only smile and act like he didn't know anything.`
`"By the way...`
` Takano-san...`
` What do you think of what Rika-chan told us near the end today...?`
` What are your thoughts?"`
`"......I want to believe that it's only paranoia.`
` ...She did say that there's no absolute proof, either."`
`"What's going on?`
` From what you've said, it sounds like Rika-chan is showing some bad symptoms?"`
`"Her test results from last week...`
` I thought they came out pretty good, but did you see anything different, Dr. Irie...?"`
`"No...`
` They were as stable as always.`
` If Satoko-chan's results are a wave during high tide, Rika-chan's are the quiet surface of a lake.`
`Ha ha ha, just like their personalities."`
`"......What's the possibility of a sudden outbreak?"`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Don't tell me Rika-chan is showing symptoms of the disease progressing?!"`
`"...Rika-chan asked us for something today.`
` ......She wanted our protection, because she feels like someone is going to murder her."`
`"No way.`
` ...Hahaha, who would try to kill her?`
` That's impossible."`
`"Rika-chan is a beloved mascot here in the village, and I don't think she has any enemies.`
` ...I think it was just her imagination, too."`
`"Why does she think that someone is trying to kill her?`
` If she's experiencing paranoia, she may be in the early L5 stage..."`
`"......She said she saw it in her dreams.`
` She wants us to reinforce security around her, because she feels threatened."`
`"For a young girl like that, it's not uncommon to get scared after having a nightmare.`
` But we need to determine if it was really just a dream, or if she's showing early symptoms of the disease..."`
`"Okay.`
` Let's give her an urgent checkup tomorrow.`
` I really hope nothing is wrong.`
` She's the most valuable person in this village."`
`"I hope she's okay.`
` ...But what should we do if she is?"`
`"...Jirou-san.`
` If that's what she wants in return for what she showed us today, it's not even a big deal.`
`If she's worried about her safety and wants to rely on us, I think we should support her. `
`That's what paying her back with our hearts is all about..."`
`"You're right.`
` Even if she was just dreaming, we'll lose her trust if we don't support her.`
` This is our chance.`
` We've found a way to show her our appreciation."`
`"...Yeah, I agree.`
` Besides, she has a right to seek that support from us."`
`"Yes. We have to make sure to protect her at all times."`
`"That's true.`
` ...Though that's your job, not mine.`
` So please, give her your best."`
`"Understood.`
` Takano-san, please do what you can to keep her safe.`
` It's probably not so serious that we need to bring in the Bloodhounds from Tokyo."`
`"Hee hee... True, you can't ask them to come over just because Rika Furude had a nightmare.`
`All right.`
` I'll order at least four members of the Mountain Dogs to watch her 24 hours a day."`
`"...That's impressive.`
` That's tighter security than when I went to Tokyo."`
`"Hee hee hee...`
` She deserves special treatment.`
`I'll make sure she gets the best security in the country!!`
` No one would dare plot an assassination on her!!`
` I'll get the best bodyguards out there!! `
`Not even a super spy could lay a finger on her!!`
` Meow meow!`
` Onigafuchi banzai!"`
`"...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` Takano-san,`
` did something good happen...?"`
`"Well,`
` I mean...`
` Ahahahahaha......"`
