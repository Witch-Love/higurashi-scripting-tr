`"Ah... yeah, I remember you telling us about that...`
`Ha ha ha.`
` But, why?`
` Why do you think Takano-san and I will be murdered?"`
`"My, my.`
` Frankly, it would be an honor for us to be the victims of the fifth curse of Oyashiro-sama!`
` Hee hee."`
`...As I'd expected, they didn't really take me telling them that they'd be killed on the night of the festival seriously.`
`They did keep their promise to tighten up my security after I showed them the ritual storehouse...`
`However, they hadn't given one thought to their own safety.`
`Oh well... like I said, I didn't expect them to believe me.`
`If they were willing to take me seriously, I could've easily changed their fate a long time ago.`
`"......I'm only going to tell you this one more time.`
` Tomitake, you're going to claw out your throat and die...`
` Takano, you're going to burn to death on top of some mountain..."`
`"I'm going to claw out my throat... like the terminal symptoms of L5?`
`Don't worry. I took the shots.`
` I don't have the disease."`
`"What happens to me is horrible too.`
` I'm going to burn to death on some mountain?`
` ...Did you have a dream about that?"`
`".........I just want both of you to be careful, at least for tonight.`
` Please listen to me, even if you don't really believe it."`
`"Did you have an ominous vision about some danger befalling us, perhaps?`
` Don't worry.`
` You're under the protection of the Mountain Dogs.`
` You've had eight security guards watching you today."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` I know I'm being protected.`
` But I want you guys to be careful too."`
`"Thank you for your concern.`
` We'll be fine. I've even been working out.`
` I think I can protect myself."`
`Tomitake flexed his biceps and smiled.`
`He was probably trying to make me feel better.`
` But all he really did was make me feel sadder.`
`......This is the sad part about being me.`
`I know the future, but I can't tell them.`
`It's as if that was a rule of the world...`
` People tend not to believe what I tell them.`
`"......But you are going to die.`
` If Tomitake and Takano die, I'll be killed next.`
` If the two of you are dead, who will protect me?"`
`"It sounds like you had a horrible dream.`
` ...Don't worry.`
` Even if we die, the Mountain Dogs will still protect you."`
`"Are you really sure they would?`
` They've never protected me before."`
`"That's not true.`
` They saved you when you got in a fight, remember?`
` They're watching you at all times. `
`Of course they aren't on alert at all times, but just as you requested the other day, the security around you is still extremely strong.`
` You even have a better security team than Dr. Irie."`
`"They'll keep on protecting me even after you die?"`
`"Of course.`
` You're the most important person to us."`
`"Ahahahaha...`
` So you're sure that we're getting killed tonight?`
` That's too bad."`
`"......If you have no intention to survive, then I only have to worry about myself."`
`My words must have left a mark on his heart.`
`He looked much more serious after I said that to him.`
`"...Good grief.`
` Okay then.`
` I'll be extra careful tonight.`
` I'll take a security guard with me when I'm going back to Okinomiya."`
`"I think someone might attack the two of you if you're alone together.`
` Make sure not to be alone with each other tonight."`
`"Hee hee hee...`
` My my, are you jealous?`
` You're such a precocious girl!"`
`...Like I thought, I can't change their fate.`
`When we saved Satoko, everyone shared the same sense of urgency.`
`That's why we all got together and saved her before it was too late.`
`However, these two have no sense of urgency at all.`
`How can I make them understand?`
`I sighed and gave up.`
`"...Tomitake, Takano...`
` Good bye.`
` Thank you for everything."`
`"Hey wait... Rika-chan...!"`
`I had nothing else to say to them now.`
`Instead, it might be worth talking to someone else.`
`If I could get someone else to protect them, I might be able to change something.`
`I can't give up yet.`
` Fate is as thin as a piece of paper...`
`It's just like the lid on a jar of jam.`
`It's not going to open unless you believe it will.`
`I have to believe that I can change my fate.`
` If I don't, it's not going to change.`
`"Tomitake-san and Takano-san...?`
` ...Are you sure about this?"`
`I've told Irie about this so many times in the past.`
`Irie tends to listen to me more seriously than Tomitake and Takano do.`
` However, that doesn't mean that he can actually do something about it.`
`"I'm the shrine maiden of Oyashiro-sama, and I have a bad feeling about this... Is that not a good enough reason?"`
`"Ha ha ha ha.`
` ...I understand.`
`It might be a message from Oyashiro-sama.`
` If that really happens tonight, it would be the fifth time in a row.`
` I'll tell the two of them to be cautious too."`
`All Irie would end up doing would be warning the two of them.`
`Which was exactly the same thing as what I did.`
` In other words, it wouldn't matter in the least...`
`Irie is just a researcher, and he has no ability to deal with unexpected trouble.`
` ...That's why Takano works for him, after all.`
`"......Please talk to them.`
` Please."`
`Who else would treat me seriously?`
`Who would be able to prevent Tomitake and Takano's death?`
`That's right... there's one man who's been fighting the curse of Oyashiro-sama with all his might!`
`"Oh, it's Furude-san.`
` I've been looking for you.`
` Akasaka-san wants to say goodbye."`
`"......I guess he and I are not meant to be."`
`"Na ha ha!`
` You're still upset about last week.`
` Akasaka-san really regrets that he wasn't able to help you.`
` He says he'd love to come back to Hinamizawa again, when he has his next vacation.`
` Na ha ha! `
`But his wife took it personally.`
` She's pretty, his wife, but she can be scary too...`
` Nfu fu fu!"`
`"Ooishi...`
` ...I have something important to tell you, but no one else believes me..."`
`"Hmm?`
` What's the matter?"`
`I've spoken to him several times in the past too.`
`He usually takes me pretty seriously.`
`However, after they die, he starts suspecting me. That's why I stopped talking to him.`
`"Where did you hear that?`
` Where at the festival?"`
`I told him that I heard someone talking about murdering them in the crowd.`
`That way, he might not be suspicious of me after the murder really happens.`
`"...Tomitake-san is not from around here... and with Takano-san, that makes two people......`
` One is going to die and one is going to disappear.`
` ......This could be the fifth year's curse of Oyashiro-sama...`
`I can't take this as anything more than a rumor, you understand.`
` But just in case...`
` We'll keep our eye on the two of them tonight."`
`"I think they were saying that they were going to attack them somewhere between Hinamizawa and Okinomiya."`
`Tomitake's body will be found on the road leading out of the village.`
`...From what I remember, he's discovered where the concrete road turns to gravel.`
`"I see.`
` I'll have a cruiser patrol around there.`
` We can spare that, at least."`
`He agreed to get involved, and he wasn't suspicious of me either.`
`I'm sure it seems odd to people that Ooishi actually believed this phony-sounding story of mine.`
`The thing about Ooishi is that he strongly believes that there's no smoke when there's no fire.`
` I've learned from experience that he tends to believe my information.`
`However, that personality of his has caused me so much trouble in previous worlds...`
`Of course, there's no question why he's so eager to believe me, either.`
`This is his last chance to expose the curse of Oyashiro-sama before his retirement.`
`Even if it might be fake, he still wanted to believe it.`
`That was convenient for me, since I couldn't show proof.`
`"...Hey, Kuma-chan, you read? Can you hear me?`
` Have a cruiser patrol the road back to Okinomiya.`
`.........No, no, it's just a precaution.`
` I heard rumor that something bad might happen around there tonight. `
`Yeah, two officers would be fine.`
` Thank you."`
`"......Thank you.`
` ...No one else believed me, and I didn't know what to do."`
`"It's my job to believe these things.`
` We'll just be glad if nothing happens.`
`Be happy to swing and miss!`
` Well, that's what my late colleague used to say. `
`Besides, it's even worse if you ignore what you're told and don't take precautions, you know?"`
`...I see.`
` That's his way of thinking about things.`
`...That was why he believed me without question.`
`I hope he won't consider me a suspect after they find their bodies tomorrow...`
`.........I shouldn't worry about that now.`
`I can still do more.`
` Who else should I talk to?`
`...Should I talk to my friends...?`
`I can't give up. I should at least try...`
`"No way!`
` You heard someone talking about that?`
`On the day of the festival? That's so wrong."`
`"You mean the curse, right?`
` You're talking about the curse of Oyashiro-sama that might happen tonight?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's happened four years in row.`
` Lots of people think that it's going to happen again tonight too."`
`"What they believe is their business, but it's not nice for them to talk about Tomitake-san and Takano-san like that."`
`"I think you should talk to them about it just in case, I think."`
`"......I already did, but they didn't believe me."`
`"I bet they didn't.`
` ...But it's too late if something really does happen.`
` I think you should talk to Ooishi-san."`
`".......I already did."`
`"Huh, I'm kinda impressed you've done all that, Rika-chama.`
`I agree that they should take every precaution.`
` ...Especially tonight."`
`"The series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa.`
` Commonly known as 'the curse of Oyashiro-sama.'`
` ...I really don't want them to keep happening every year. `
`Somebody might end up imitating it, and it's bad publicity for the village too."`
`"So if nothing happens tonight, it means the curse is over, right?`
` We should definitely make sure that nothing happens, then."`
`"What can we do?`
` Are you suggesting that we should patrol around the village or something?"`
`"I think patrolling might be even more careless.`
` Do you really think we can do something about this?"`
`"For starters, there's a chance some deviant trying to imitate the serial murders might be within the Watanagashi preparation committee, so let's be wary of any unfamiliar faces."`
`"It's easy for us to tell strangers apart from the locals.`
` We can spot them right away.`
` I think we'll be fine..."`
`"......But Tomitake and Takano will still be killed."`
`"Rika-chan...`
` ......All right. Let's try to do what we can."`
`"I agree!`
` We can't protect them all night, but let's stay with them at least until the festival is over.`
` As long as we're there, the bad guys won't be able to do anything to them."`
`I couldn't tell if they really believed me or not, but they listened to me, at least.`
`We decided to keep our eyes on Tomitake and Takano and protect them for the rest of the night.`
`I guess I've done everything I can now.`
`...Though it's hard to believe this is enough to prevent their deaths...`
`"......I just have to hope nothing's happened when I wake up tomorrow morning."`
`"...Do you think you can prevent Tomitake and Takano's deaths, Rika?"`
`"...It might be impossible.`
` Their deaths might be the bell that portends my doom."`
`"............Au au."`
`"But Takano told me earlier`
` that even if they die, the Mountain Dogs are supposed to keep protecting me.`
` They might bring in more squads from Tokyo too...... `
`Even if they die, the situation will be different this time."`
`"............What if it still doesn't work out?"`
`"...Then I will just have to die...`
` Anyway, I'm not going to give up until the very end.`
` I'll struggle to my very limits.`
` I won't give up and spend the rest of my time drinking wine."`
`".........Do whatever you want to do, Rika."`
`"You still believe that nothing is going to change, Hanyuu?"`
`".........I don't believe anything. It's only fate."`
`"I keep getting hurt because I have hope, huh."`
`If I'm an actress trying to get up on the stage, Hanyuu is a real bystander.`
`We have very different opinions when it comes to this.`
`"......Rika.`
` No matter what happens, don't give up..."`
`"That sounds like you're convinced that nothing is going to change.`
` Lately, the things you say have been pissing me off."`
`"......Au au au..."`
`I understand.`
`Hanyuu keeps telling me not to get my hopes up because she cares about me.`
`Because I hope to defeat fate, I get hurt when that hope is betrayed.`
`And the more I get hurt, the closer I get to losing my mind and disappearing.`
`For Hanyuu, that means losing her only friend.`
`Losing me is probably the most unbearable thought for Hanyuu, since she has to live alone, unable to communicate with anyone else.`
`...I now believe that fate can be changed.`
`Even when I didn't have that faith, I still believed that eventually I'd find a way to get out of this maze.`
`Perhaps... Hanyuu knows something I don't.`
`I might just be a goldfish inside of a fish bowl.`
` There might be no way for me to escape my fate.`
`We're stuck alone inside of a fish bowl, yet every day I knock on the glass, believing that I can break it someday.`
`...Hanyuu keeps telling me that I'm wasting my time.`
`If I get hurt and die, she would have to survive all by herself inside the fish bowl.`
`With that, I think I finally understand our difference of opinions.`
`Hanyuu has lived for a much longer time than I have.`
`...Because of that, she understands the laws of this infinitely spanning world better than I do.`
`...No matter how much I refute Hanyuu... I can never refute the truth.`
`Even so...... I still have to believe in my own faith.`
`I believe in a spear that will pierce the wall of fate. My faith will make that spear sharper than ever.`
`We found Tomitake in the crowd and struck up a conversation with him to keep him around as long as we could.`
`However, as soon as the festival ended, they tried to leave.`
`If they left now, I'd never see them again.`
`Mion tried insisting they stay at her house for the night, but Tomitake refused.`
`Everyone tried various ways stop them from being alone because the murderer might be around.`
`However, we eventually started to believe that they wanted to be alone for adult reasons...`
` and I wound up suggesting that we shouldn't interrupt the two lovebirds...`
`"Don't worry, Rika-chan.`
` Tomitake-san is a man, after all.`
` I'm sure he'll do anything to protect Takano-san."`
`"Is that so?`
` If something happens, you'll rescue me, right?"`
`"Ah, ahahahahaha... Th-That's the plan!"`
`"Well, we really should go now.`
` It's getting pretty late."`
`"Thank you for your concern.`
` Hee hee..."`
`"D-Don't make any assumptions!!`
` I'm heading to the clinic because I left something there.`
` Takano-san has the key, so we have to go together!"`
`"Oh, I didn't know that you were into playing doctor."`
`"Nah, I think he's more into playing gynecologist.`
` Heh heh heh!"`
`Crash, bang, wham!!`
`"Hauuu!!`
` I wonder how they play doctor, I wonder!"`
`"Don't hit them just because you feel embarrassed...`
` And as for you two,`
` stop only getting along when you're making dirty jokes..."`
`"...G-Goodbye, everyone...`
` Ahahaha...`
` I really am just going back there to get what I forgot...`
` Don't follow us, okay...?`
` Ahahahaha..."`
`"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... Hauuu!"`
`"......Tomitake... please be careful..."`
`"I do think you're overreacting, Rika.`
` ...Hwaaaaah..."`
`Everyone laughed when Satoko yawned.`
`It seemed like a good time to call it a day.`
`...It doesn't feel like I was able to change their fate.`
`I just hope that they pay attention, and that they're prepared for whatever faces them.`
` ...I still might have a chance.`
`All I can do now is pray.`
`"Good bye, Tomitake-san!`
` Please show us the pictures you took next time!"`
`"Make sure you wear your punishment shirt!!"`
`"Man, I'm so jealous you get to spend a night with a pretty lady! Whoo, whoo!"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha.`
` See you guys again.`
` I guess it'll be in fall."`
`"That's if we don't get killed tonight.`
` Hee hee.`
` Good night, everyone."`
`"Good night!"`
`That was the best I could do on the night of Watanagashi.`
