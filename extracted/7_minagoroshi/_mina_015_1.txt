`The child consultation center had finally contacted Satoko's uncle after finding out she was missing from school for three days in a row.`
`I'm sure it was because of our efforts that Satoko was able to come to school today.`
`However, we couldn't really celebrate after seeing her painful expression.`
`"Satoko... We were so worried about you...!"`
`"Are you sure nothing happened to you these past three days?"`
`"...I really did have a fever the whole time.`
` ...I am sorry for making you all worry..."`
`She started telling us why she hadn't been at school. `
`...Nobody had even asked her that.`
`"......Her uncle must have told her to say that to everyone.`
` It's so painful to see her like this..."`
`Rena seemed more angry than sad.`
`...Inside, I felt the same way.`
` It felt like my anger was boiling up and lodging painfully in my throat.`
`He was only letting Satoko come to school because he was now certain that she wouldn't do anything that would put him at a disadvantage.`
`...He was treating her like a tamed animal.`
`...Was... was it too late already...?`
`I thought of the broken Satoko I once saw in my imaginary world...`
`"Satoko.`
` .........Do your best, okay?"`
`"...Of course I will.`
` I'm doing well... even though Nii-nii isn't here with me..."`
`I slowly... reached out my hand`
` toward her head.`
`"As a reward for you doing your best... I'll... pat your head.`
` Do you mind...?"`
`"............"`
`She didn't reply, but she didn't refuse either.`
`I slowly`
` put my hand on her head.`
`She didn't react to it, but... a tear rolled down from her eye all of a sudden.`
`Was she crying because she didn't want to be touched?`
`...No... that wasn't it.`
` Rather, it was the opposite.`
`If I stopped patting her head, I'd hurt her feelings.`
`Satoko felt obligated to survive without her Nii-nii.`
`But that didn't mean she didn't want anyone else's help.`
`She couldn't appreciate my patting her head openly.`
`...Satoko had no choice but to cry in silence.`
`"Satoko-chan...`
` We won't tell anyone if you cry right now..."`
`And after Rena said that, Satoko started crying like a baby.`
`I felt relieved, knowing that it wasn't too late.`
`She hadn't yet suffered from the fatal emotional wound that I saw in my imaginary world.`
`However, her tears made it clear that I needed to save her as soon as possible, no matter what the whole world might say to me.`
`"...Satoko...... Everyone is going to help save you.`
` I promise you that."`
`"............"`
`"Satoko...`
` We weren't just doing nothing for these past three days.`
` Right, Kei-chan?"`
`"Right. We're making an appeal to the child consultation center.`
` We're asking them to save you from your horrible uncle...!"`
`"......You don't... have to do that for me..."`
`"It's not just us.`
` Right, Tomita-kun?"`
`"It's not just me either.`
` Okamura and the whole class are fighting for you!"`
`"That's right!`
` We all went to the child consultation center together!`
` We're going today too!`
` Right, Maebara-san?"`
`"Yup!`
` We're not going to give up until we save you!"`
`All the boys and girls in the class answered my call with their cheers.`
`Satoko seemed a little surprised, but then soon became expressionless again.`
`"Is that why the social worker came to my house...?`
` That really wasn't necessary of you..."`
`"Satoko... Did he hurt you because of that..?!"`
`"............."`
`She wouldn't answer.`
`I couldn't tell what that silence really meant.`
`Soon after, Chie-sensei entered the classroom. She must have heard the noise we were making.`
`"Houjou-san!`
` Are you feeling better now?"`
`We didn't know for sure if she was really sick or not.`
` All of us, including Chie-sensei, were feeling the same thing.`
`"Yes.`
` ...I am fine.`
` I'm sorry for worrying you.`
` Everything is all right now."`
`"Will you...`
` be attending school regularly from now on...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...You don't... have to continue worrying about me...`
` You don't have to... talk to any more social workers."`
`"Houjou-san...`
` If you feel overwhelmed, you can come stay with me.`
` I'm on your side, okay?`
` You are welcome at my house any time."`
`"Hey, Chie-sensei! Don't act like you're the only one who can help her!`
` Satoko, we're all on your side here!"`
`"That's right.`
` You can come to my apartment too.`
` We have an extra room, so you can use it as your own!"`
`"......She can't do that.`
` Satoko is my pet. She has to come back to my house.`
` Nipah~â˜†"`
`"See...?`
` You're not alone.`
` Everyone is trying so hard to save you...!"`
`But...`
` I don't know if people at the child consultation center will ever understand how we feel.`
`If what Ooishi-san told me yesterday was true,`
` ...then once they learn this isn't the will of all Hinamizawa,`
` once they learn it's only her classmates creating a stir, they might harden their stance against us.`
`All we had planned was to go there with more people and ask for the same thing.`
`The child consultation center was going to say the same thing to us, too.`
`It wasn't going to be any different from yesterday.`
` They'd tell us that it's only normal for her uncle to take care of Satoko, because he's legally her guardian.`
`They'd also tell us that there's no proof of any abuse happening.`
`...And why do they think that?`
`Because Satoko won't admit she's being abused.`
`"...I appreciate your kindness...`
` But I'm fine..."`
`"That's a lie."`
`Rena spoke with a smile, but her words cut sharp.`
`"You're not okay, Satoko-chan.`
` You're not fooling us well enough.`
` All of us here and many more people know that you are in pain right now.`
` That's why we're doing our best to stand up and help you. `
`We're reaching out our hands so we can save you from your struggle.`
` .........But we can't save you without you helping too!"`
`"She's right, Satoko.`
` No matter what we say to the center,`
` they'll tell us that there's no abuse because you're denying that it's happening.`
` We all want to help you, but we can't if you don't accept our help...!"`
`"I understand... I was just like you once...`
` I thought no one could help me.`
` I thought whatever I was doing was the only thing I could do.`
` That's why I didn't even accept my friends' help.`
`But someone taught me something. I can't even remember who it was... but someone taught me something!`
`The world you want most is right in front of you.`
` But you won't get there unless you take our hands!`
` It doesn't mean anything if we're the only ones reaching out.`
` Satoko-chan!`
` You have to reach your hand to us too! `
`We can take each others' hands and return to the world we wish for!"`
`".........Rena...`
` ...Who told you that...?"`
`"Aha ha... I don't remember...`
` I think I heard it before I went to kindergarten.`
` I can't remember who told me that...`
`But I can still clearly remember that feeling.`
` I'm here because of what that person taught me."`
`"..........."`
`"I agree...`
` Whoever it was who taught that to Rena, he wasn't wrong.`
` Satoko, do you think it's better not to ask for help?`
` You think that's the best thing you can do.`
` But you're wrong about that!! `
`Look at yourself in the mirror. Is that the face you want to wear?!`
` I'm sure it's not!`
` You don't want any part of this world!`
` We can bring you back to the world you want to live in!`
` We're reaching our hands out. `
`Those hands are almost touching you...!`
`But we just can't reach far enough.`
` If we could, we'd pull you by the hair to get you out of this mess!!`
` But we can't make it!`
` So you have to reach out your hand too!`
` Our hands are right here! `
`They're right in front of your nose!`
` So take them!`
` If you'd just reach out your hand, we could pull you up into a happier world!"`
`"..........."`
`Satoko wouldn't reach out her hand...`
`She just stared at mine as though praying for something.`
`Her fingers were shaking,`
` but Satoko wouldn't try to reach her hand toward mine...`
`I felt like screaming out in anger, but I didn't want to scare her.`
`If I did that, she'd never trust me again.`
`...All I could do...`
` was to wait for her to reach out her hand...`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...Really, I do appreciate it.`
` ......But...`
` ...I really am perfectly fine.`
` ...I really... ugh......"`
`"...S...... Satoko..."`
`"......She needs... more time..."`
`Satoko needed time to sort out her feelings.`
`But her time limit was getting closer and closer...`
`It was unfortunate that Satoko didn't even realize that herself.`
`The next moment, we heard someone approaching our classroom.`
`By the sound of the footsteps, we could tell that it was the principal.`
`And so, I couldn't tell why Satoko was twitching like she just got electrocuted.`
`The door quickly opened and the principal strode inside.`
`He seemed relieved to see Satoko back in school.`
`However, Satoko reacted both dramatically`
` and bizarrely...`
`She let out an inexplicable scream, ran to the back of the classroom, and hid behind the curtain.`
`No one in the classroom could understand her actions.`
`We never even considered that it was because the principal had entered the room.`
`The principal, however, realized it immediately.`
`Satoko was scared to see him.`
`"H...`
` Houjou-kun, is everything all right?"`
`He spoke in a kind voice, but Satoko was still afraid.`
`It was plain as day to all of us that Satoko was frightened at the sight of the principal, but none of us could understand why.`
`"A-Are you okay, Satoko...?`
` You don't need to be afraid!`
` We're all on your side!"`
`"My uncle is... my uncle is here...!"`
`Everyone here thought for sure that Satoko's uncle had shown up to get her.`
`We all rose up at once, shielded Satoko in a circle, and searched the surroundings.`
`I had yet to see her uncle's face, but we were in school now.`
`If someone unfamiliar showed up, I could spot him immediately.`
`If he tried to force Satoko to leave...`
` then forget everything else.`
` I'd end the fight right here!`
`Mion and Shion are thinking the same thing.`
`However, while Satoko remained frightened, we couldn't find any sight of her uncle.`
`...Satoko was trembling as if he was already here inside our classroom,`
` but there was no sight of him.`
`Finally... I realized the truth.`
`Satoko was frightened by the figure of the principal.`
`I could understand that she'd be scared of his footsteps, but she was still terrified after he showed his face.`
` This was not normal.`
`...It was made clear to me how much stress Satoko was dealing with.`
`Rika-chan hushed Satoko and whispered into her ear.`
`"...It's okay. Your uncle isn't here.`
` Your mean uncle isn't here..."`
`"But he's right there!`
` My uncle is there!!`
`He's come to take me back home!!"`
`"Calm down, Satoko...`
` Did you take your shot today...?"`
`"My uncle... my uncle is here...!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!!`
`Nii-nii, Nii-nii!!"`
`"Her shot...?`
` What are you talking about, Rika-chan?"`
`"...Keiichi. She needs Irie's help.`
` Just tell him that Satoko is in an emergency.`
` Hurry up!!`
` Chie, let's take her to the nurse's office...!!"`
`"What's wrong, Satoko-chan?!`
` Satoko-chan!!"`
`"Let's call the Coach!!`
` She needs to see a doctor!`
` Does anyone have his number?!"`
`"I do!!`
` Let's go use the phone in the teacher's office!"`
`I headed to the nurse's office after I asked Mion to make a phone call to the doctor.`
`There were lots of students surrounding the office.`
`Chie-sensei was forcing out the other kids who had entered the room with them.`
`I snuck behind her and entered it myself.`
`Satoko was lying down on the bed, still shaking with fear.`
`Rena and Rika-chan were there with her and were trying to calm her down.`
`...I spoke quietly so as not to scare Satoko.`
`"Is she okay...?`
` What's going on with her...?"`
`"Umm...`
` I don't really know... but she's very scared... She thought the principal was her uncle..."`
`Hearing that made it easier to understand... but it was still hard to believe.`
`He had been right in front of us, and had spoken to her in such a kind voice.`
`It was really hard to believe that she couldn't tell that it was the principal...`
`"......When there's a dark spot on the wall, what does it look like to you?"`
`"What?"`
`"......People who hate flies will think it's a fly.`
` It may look like a spider or cockroach if that's what you hate. `
`People tend to sense something they don't like when they can't really tell what that something is."`
`"She thought of her uncle...... when she heard the principal's footsteps?"`
`"But... she was still scared even after he showed up..."`
`"...The illness Satoko has prevents her from correcting those misassumptions easily."`
`What does she mean, illness...?`
`I tried to ask Rika-chan that, but Satoko was becoming even more frightened.`
`Rika-chan held her hand gently and tried to calm her down.`
`Rena tapped my shoulder.`
`She was indicating to me that we should leave Rika-chan and Satoko alone in the room.`
`I agreed with her. Satoko was in tremendous shock...`
`"We're going back to the classroom for now..."`
`"......Yes, please do."`
`Rena and I left the nurse's office.`
`My classmates were still asking Chie-sensei about Satoko's condition.`
`As soon as they saw me, they walked over and asked how she was.`
`"Let's leave it up to Rika-chan for now.`
` Satoko is very frightened.`
` Please don't do anything to make her afraid.`
` She will only get more scared if we continue to make this much noise."`
`"Let's go back to the classroom.`
` Coach will be here soon, and he'll take care of her.`
` You called him, right, Mii-chan?"`
`"Yeah.`
` He'll be here right away.`
` He said to let Rika-chan take care of her...`
` and not to let her out of the nurse's office..."`
`"Get back to the class, everyone!`
` We're going to start homeroom!"`
`While the teacher took our attendance, a car arrived on the school premises.`
`Everyone's attention was drawn to it.`
`Three people with white gowns came out of the vehicle.`
`Irie ran into the school in a hurry.`
`We were surprised to see three people show up.`
`It made us all worry that Satoko was in worse shape than we'd realized...`
`Chie-sensei felt the same way.`
`She left the class to Mion, and hurried to the nurse's office.`
`Despite our worries, Satoko returned to the classroom about ten minutes later.`
`She was still as depressed as she was in the morning, but she was no longer in a state of panic.`
`"...Satoko!`
` Are you okay now?`
` I think you should rest some more!"`
`"I'm sorry for scaring you...`
` I'm fine now..."`
`"Satoko-chan..."`
`Satoko seemed bothered by the way we were worrying about her.`
`Chie-sensei also returned to the classroom. At the same time, I snuck out so I could talk to Irie and his staff.`
`I saw him talking with Rika-chan.`
`"...Coach...`
` Is Satoko really okay...?!"`
`"Maebara-san.`
`...Yes, she's fine for now.`
` We should keep an eye on her, though."`
`"......It was just a little panic attack.`
` She's all good now."`
`"Just a little panic attack? Are you sure...?`
` You were saying that Satoko has some kind of illness..."`
`"...Well, I should be going.`
` Please call me if anything happens."`
`Coach bowed and left without making any comment.`
`It was like he was avoiding my question about Satoko's condition...`
`"Keiichi...`
` Can you promise to keep a secret?"`
`"What?`
` Oh...`
` sure."`
`"Satoko's been sick since a few years ago...`
` She's been getting treatment for that illness for a long time."`
`It was surprising to hear that.`
`That meant she was already sick when I first met her.`
` I'd never seen any sign of that, though.`
`"That disease can't be cured easily...`
` But she can live a normal life as long as she gets proper treatment and medication."`
`"I see...`
` It sounds like it's under control.`
` I had no idea that she was sick until you just told me about it.`
` She should be fine, right?"`
`She was hardly in a good condition, so that makes me hesitant to use the word 'fine'.`
`What kind of disease could Satoko have...?`
`Based on what I saw earlier, she might have a mental illness rather than a physical one...`
`It might be because of how she was abused in the past...`
`I've heard that mental trauma is not easy to cure, and it needs medical attention at times.`
` ......That must be what's going on with her.`
`"......Satoko has to take two shots every day.`
` Since her uncle was bullying her, she forgot to take her shot this morning."`
`"You mean... Satoko becomes emotionally unstable...`
` if she doesn't take those shots?"`
`Rika-chan nodded quietly.`
`Really, it was quite a shock.`
`The Satoko I know is an energetic and mischievous girl who is always bouncing around like a super ball.`
`I couldn't believe that she'd turn into a scared little animal just by forgetting to take a shot...`
`"She becomes very afraid when she doesn't get her shots.`
` ...When something happens suddenly, or when she hears a strange noise or sees something unusual, she feels like they're things that are coming to harm her."`
`"So... she thought her uncle came to the school when she heard the principal's footsteps..."`
`"That's right.`
` Once she convinced herself that the footsteps belonged to her uncle, that became the truth for her.`
` Even after she saw the principal's face, her mind told her that it was her uncle."`
`"You said she can't organize information quickly enough...`
` Is that what her illness is all about?`
` I don't even want to know what the disease is called...`
` I feel so bad for her... `
`I had no clue that she'd been fighting this condition for so long... that poor girl..."`
`"Keiichi...`
` Please don't tell Satoko anything about her illness."`
`Why not...?`
` I guess I shouldn't ask...`
`It might not be a nice thing to talk to her about her mental illness.`
` I guess that's what she's trying to tell me...`
`"She came back to the classroom, but is she okay now?"`
`"Irie gave her an injection, so she's all right for now."`
`She's seriously sick to the point where she requires a doctor's attention...`
` I realized something in the next moment.`
`"Hey... Maybe we can have her be hospitalized..."`
`We can force her to stay in a hospital even if she refuses.`
`That way, we can save her from her uncle.`
` Yes, that's a great idea.`
`"Irie suggested that before...`
` But Satoko refused."`
`"It's not about her refusing or not.`
` If the doctor tells her to stay..."`
`".........Keiichi.`
` If Satoko doesn't go back home... her uncle is going to get rid of her Nii-nii's room."`
`"Wh,`
` what...?"`
`"......Satoko feels obligated to protect the Houjou residence until Satoshi comes home."`
`He was taking advantage of her...?`
`Teppei was telling her that he'd get rid of Satoshi's room if she didn't stay with him...?`
`"......Tha... that's horrible...!!"`
`"Please don't tell anyone about this...`
` Shii is not good at controlling herself, so she might get very angry about this."`
`She brought up Shion, but I was also furious about it.`
`I had to calm down, though.`
`I needed everyone's help in order to save Satoko.`
`I couldn't ruin everything by acting foolishly.`
`I had no time to stop.`
`"Damn it!`
` If Satoko asked us for help, we could help her right away!"`
`Just because she hadn't asked didn't mean she didn't need it! As her friends, we had to help her!`
`Especially after learning that he was controlling her by threatening to get rid of Satoshi's room!`
`"She told you that he's threatening her, right?`
` Can't we take that as an SOS?"`
`Rika-chan nodded slightly.`
`"Keiichi...`
` We don't have much time left..."`
`That, I was all too aware of.`
`She had a panic attack just because she didn't take her shot this morning...`
` But if she stayed in her current environment, it'd be too late to save her in a matter of days.`
`...I saw her future when I saw Satoko crying behind the curtain this morning...`
`"This is the third day.`
` We have ten times more people on our side than we had on the first day... but we're not going to stop there!!"`
`"...Keiichi.`
` It won't be that easy to save Satoko.`
` .........I've tried many times before, but never succeeded."`
`"Really...?"`
`".........You don't remember...`
` ...But you're different this time...`
` I think you're getting very close to saving her.`
` ...I believe that you're someone who can defeat fate."`
`What did she mean when she said I didn't remember?`
`I didn't have time to ask questions, though.`
`"Yeah.`
` You're right!`
` I'll defeat fate. Just watch me!"`
