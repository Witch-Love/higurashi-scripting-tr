`"...I don't want to see any sweets for at least three days...`
` Uggh..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha, you tried a little too hard, Keiichi-kun."`
`Rena ate a massive amount of desserts too, but her stomach seemed to be just fine...`
`"I think girls have four stomachs...`
` Or at least an extra stomach for dessert..."`
`"It is very rude of you to say something like that to a lady!!`
` This is what you get for being rude!"`
`Bam.`
` ...Oww!`
`Satoko had poked me very hard in my bloated stomach.`
`"Ah!!`
` S-S-Stop it!`
` Please don't poke my stomach!!`
` I'm going to throw up!!"`
`Satoko and Rika-chan grinned mischievously upon hearing that.`
` ...A chill ran up my spine.`
`Why were they smiling like that and walking towards me so gleefully?`
`"No, stop it! You cold-blooded demons!!"`
`"Ho ho ho!!`
` This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do you really think I'd let it slip away?!"`
`"...Meep☆.`
` Your bloated tummy is in danger, Keiichi."`
`"Ahahahahaha, your big wiggly tummy is sho kyute!"`
`"S-Stop it...!!`
` Ah! Nooooo!!!"`
`Rena joined Satoko and Rika-chan in torturing me. We were still making a lot of noise outside the restaurant.`
`I desperately blocked my stomach from their attacks, but someone else hit me from behind.`
`"Owwwwwww!!`
` Wh-Who is it?!!"`
`"Hello, hello!`
` Nice to see you, Kei-chan and his funny friends!"`
`"Oh, Shii-chan!`
` Hello!`
`You weren't at the restaurant today, were you?"`
`"I'm working night shift today.`
` I just changed after getting here."`
`"...How can you go outside the restaurant wearing that uniform?"`
`"What? I'm not embarrassed.`
` Especially not since you had to walk around in a way more embarrassing costume the other day."`
`...Guhh!!`
`...Damn it... I was just getting over it...!`
` She had just reminded me that I'll never be able to get married...`
`"Anyway, I heard you went crazy in the restaurant today."`
`"Ahahahahaha, we did.`
` We had to, since it turned into a club activity... you know?"`
`"You made a big mess in there...`
` It looks like Sis felt guilty, so she's helping the waitresses clean up the store now."`
`"...I still think we should help them clean."`
`"Oh, don't worry about it.`
` We can't let customers do that."`
`"......Plus, Mii made most of the mess."`
`Yeah, that's right.`
` Everybody nodded in agreement...`
`"She told me to tell you guys that you don't have to wait for her.`
` You can go home now."`
`"No, we're going to wait.`
` Right, everybody?"`
`Rena asked for our agreement.`
`Of course we decided to wait without hesitation.`
` Satoko, Rika-chan, and I all nodded along.`
`"Since we can't help her clean, that's the least we can do.`
` While she says we can go home, I'm pretty sure she'd be sad if we really did leave."`
`"Wow...`
` Kei-chan, you grew up. I'm impressed."`
`"Ahahahahaha, he grew up all right!`
` That's because we've been training him well.`
` Right?"`
`"That's correct!"`
`"Nipah~☆."`
`"You girls always band together when it comes to things like this!"`
`I hate girls. They get along so easily just because they're girls!`
`In the end, we ended up making a lot more noise, even dragging Shion into the mess this time.`
`"Shion, get back in here and help us clean!`
` Where did you put the washcloths?"`
`"Oh, no.`
` I guess I have to go back to work now."`
`"Mii-chan!`
` Do you think it's going to take a while?"`
`"What?`
` Why are you still here?`
`Are you waiting for this ol' man?!`
` Don't worry about me!`
` Go on home already!"`
`Mion looked happy to see us waiting for her, but she always says the opposite of what she thinks.`
`I wonder when she'll grow up to be able to just honestly say thank you.`
`"We're friends, remember?`
` We'll wait until you finish up."`
`"I wish we could help you...`
` I feel bad."`
`"I told you, you don't have to wait for me!`
` I'm going to wait for Shion to finish work tonight, then head to her house in Okinomiya afterward.`
` So you really don't need to wait for me.`
` I do appreciate it, though."`
`"...Are you sure?`
` I still feel bad."`
`"Yeah.`
` Me too, me too."`
`"We have enough people, so really, don't worry about it.`
` Go home before it gets too cold."`
`"......We understand.`
`Mii, I hope you can finish cleaning soon. Go for it, yay."`
`"Woo!`
` Thanks.`
`Kei-chan,`
` I trust you to escort the ladies home safely.`
` Please protect them from assassins on their way home."`
`Looking around, I didn't see any ladies who needed an escort.`
` ...I felt more like I was the one who needed protection.`
`Anyway, we said our goodbyes, making it easier for us to end the day and go home.`
`"Goodbye, Mii-chan!`
` See you tomorrow!"`
`"Yep!`
` See you tomorrow!"`
`"Alright. Let's go, then!"`
`We waved at Mion until she went back inside the restaurant, and after that, we all got on our bicycles and left Okinomiya.`
`On the way home, we talked about how exciting it had been today, and it looked like everyone was still fired up.`
`We had the horrifying punishment and the competitive eating contest, which turned into an unprecedented battle involving all the customers in the restaurant... And after that, everything got crazy and messy.`
`At first, the waitresses didn't know what to do, but after a while they ended up joining in. We had a blast.`
`"That was wonderful!!`
` Did you see what Tomita and Okamura did? How amusing it was!"`
`"......I felt sorry for Kameda and Irie."`
`"So did I, but!`
` Didn't you think my speech was great?!`
` Everyone in the restaurant was on my side after that!!"`
`"......Keiichi, you might have been somebody really important if you were born in a different era."`
`"What, this idiot? He's much too full of himself!`
` An idiot will always remain an idiot, no matter when or where he is born!"`
`"......If he was born a hundred years earlier, he might've gotten printed on bills."`
`"Money with Keiichi-san's face on it? How pathetic!`
` They would only be worth two or three hundred yen at the most!"`
`Satoko and Rika-chan kept up their continuous chatter.`
`I was a bit tired after the day's events, so I just listened quietly.`
`I noticed the wind was getting colder.`
` Our shadows were getting longer as well.`
`Satoko and Rika-chan still had a lot of energy left... but what about Rena?`
`She'd been very quiet.`
`Maybe she also had a stomachache from eating too much.`
` I looked at Rena to see.`
`However, I was wrong.`
`Rena was...... I didn't really know how to describe it.`
` ...She looked very satisfied.`
`She looked like she really did have that much fun.`
`She looked like she was as happy as she could ever be.`
`...I could tell all that without her saying a word.`
`When I looked at her... it made me realize that the word 'fun' wasn't enough to describe what we did today.`
`"...Seems like you had a lot of fun."`
`"Mm.`
` ...What about you, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"I had a blast too!`
` I wish we could have as much fun tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too."`
`"I feel the same way.`
` I wish from the bottom of my heart that the time we spent in the restaurant today would last forever."`
`"Wow, that's kinda poetic."`
`"Don't you agree, Keiichi-kun?"`
`Rena didn't notice that I made fun of her.`
`I might've been a little tactless.`
` Suddenly, I regretted having said it.`
`"I do. I totally agree with you."`
`"But, you know something?`
` Today's not the only day that's filled with happiness."`
`A cool wind blew through her hair.`
`She smiled at me, and for some reason, she looked very mature.`
` ...Her appearance made my heart skip a beat.`
`"Every single one of our days in Hinamizawa is a wonderful, precious, and irreplaceable day full of happiness.`
`Including the boring days when our club activities get canceled."`
`"...Rena, you think about things in a very mature way."`
`"Ahahahaha. No, I don't.`
` Honestly, I'm still not done playing around yet.`
` Maybe it's just because I'm still excited."`
`Rena laughed, and that made me laugh too.`
`Satoko thought that we were laughing because we said bad things about her, and she started bugging me about it.`
`Once again, we made a lot of noise like we always do.`
`"......Well, Satoko and I are taking this turn here."`
`"Rika, why not walk with them a little further and turn where the tobacco store is instead?"`
`"......Did you forget our nightlight burned out?`
` Without that, it's too dark for us to sleep."`
`"O-Oh... that would be quite the problem."`
`"Oh, I see. You need to go to Makino-san's general store.`
` Then I guess we'll say goodbye here.`
` You'd better take this turn or you'd have to go a long way around."`
`Makino-san's general store......?`
` ...Oh right, that's where it is.`
`If they wanted to make a stop at the store before going back to the shrine, turning here would be the quickest way.`
`"Okay then.`
` Bye, Rika-chan. Bye, Satoko.`
` I'll see you tomorrow."`
`"......See you tomorrow."`
`"Farewell, Keiichi-san.`
` Farewell, Rena-san!"`
`"See you two tomorrow!`
` Bye-bye!"`
`Rika-chan and Satoko waved at us many times, then took the narrow path through the field.`
`Once the noisy girls were gone, it went especially quiet all of a sudden.`
`It even made me feel as if the sun had set in an instant.`
`I could see my house by now, which everybody called the "Maebara mansion".`
`I didn't notice it earlier because of how fired up we all were, but my stomach was about to burst.`
`...The growling in my gut felt like thunder.`
`My body must have been paying the price for me acting like an idiot earlier.`
`There was no way I was eating dinner that night.`
`I'd need to tell my mom before she started cooking.`
`...But before anything, I had to get to the bathroom.`
`...Uu...`
` My stomach was churning.`
` Oh boy.`
` It really didn't sound good.`
`We got to the place where I'd always meet Rena in the morning and say goodbye in the evening.`
`"I really did have a lot of fun today."`
`"Mm.`
` Me too.`
`...Hm? Are you feeling okay, Keiichi-kun?"`
`"Nahahaha...`
` My stomach is growling.`
` I guess I just need to get some rest."`
`"Ahahahaha, you need to train your stomach, huh? Huh?"`
`"...You ate about as much as I did.`
` How did you fit all that inside your tiny body?"`
`"Hee hee hee.`
` That would be...`
` a woman's secret!"`
`Rena giggled and tried to avoid giving me an answer.`
`She'd probably hit me if I pressed her about it.`
`If she punched me in the stomach, I'd throw up for sure...`
` So, I decided not to go any further.`
`"Goodbye, Rena.`
` See you tomorrow."`
`"Yes.`
` See you tomorrow."`
`"You know, I used to live in the city."`
`"Yeah?"`
`"I never managed to enjoy each and every day like this before.`
` ...But after moving to Hinamizawa, you know...`
` ...I think I've found happiness."`
`"I feel the same way.`
` I moved to Hinamizawa a year ago.`
` I can't believe I'm as happy as I am and spend every day having as much fun as I do."`
`"I see.`
` I'm sure tomorrow will be the same."`
`"That's right.`
` We had so much fun yesterday and today.`
`So, tomorrow will be the same."`
`"With all the fun we have every day, I sometimes feel like I'm going to trip and fall sometime, and it kind of scares me, ahahaha."`
`"...You fall when you fall no matter how careful you are.`
`That's why I believe we have to enjoy every moment as much as we can."`
`"You're right.`
` We gotta enjoy every day as much as we can!"`
`"Well, it's probably time to go.`
` Please say hi to your parents for me.`
` ...Well, I still have a lot of energy left, hau!`
` So I'm going to go treasure hunting!"`
`"What, are you going there now?!`
` You sure are resilient... I'm impressed."`
`"What about you?`
` Would you like to come along?`
`I found a new trash pile that I haven't dug up yet!`
`I might find something totally kyute in there!"`
`"I'm sorry, but I gotta pass.`
` Besides, it looks like a storm's brewing.`
` I think you should go straight home, too."`
`"Hau, I usually find something kyute when I've had a wonderful day like today.`
` So, I'm going there just for a few minutes.`
` Ehehehe☆...!"`
`I felt sick enough that I didn't feel like going with her.`
` If I felt better, I would've gone treasure hunting with her for sure.`
`She didn't want to go home yet because she didn't want the fun day to end. That's exactly how I felt, too.`
`"I understand.`
` Bye then!`
` I hope you can find something kyute!"`
`"Yep!`
` Thank you!`
` Bye bye!!"`
`Keiichi-kun waved over and over as if he didn't want to say goodbye yet.`
`But after a while, he was gone.`
`Well, I had to go too, because I was going to go treasure hunting.`
`I love kyute things.`
`I had such a wonderful day today that I'm sure I'm going to get lucky at treasure hunting.`
`I definitely will find some wonderful treasures.`
`I pedaled my bicycle with determination.`
`My house was nearby, but I took another street that led to the dam construction site.`
`It might have been okay to go home just then...`
`but I hesitated to go, since I didn't want to be seen.`
`I had so much fun today, and I wanted to continue feeling happy as long as I could.`
`It was already getting late, but I felt like it was getting dark faster than usual.`
`Just like Keiichi-kun said, the clouds in the sky were growing darker.`
`It might start raining hard.`
`"...But that doesn't mean I have to go home already."`
`Stop it, Rena.`
`You had so much fun today.`
`You have to stay happy as long as you can.`
`I'm happy.`
`I enjoy every day.`
`Rena, say it. Say the magical words.`
`"...H`
`......`
` hau..."`
`Don't be embarrassed. You're not dumb or anything.`
`I might be able to enjoy every day even more if I were dumb.`
`If so, dumb is what I'd want to be.`
`"...Hauu☆!`
` I'm going to find something sho, sho kyute!`
` And take it home with me!"`
`There, I said it.`
`I'm sure I can find something kyute.`
`As long as I believe it's kyute, anything can be that way.`
`I should fill my heart with happy memories of today and yesterday.`
`I should look forward to the happiness I'm going to receive tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too.`
`I reached the dam construction site. A mountain of trash loomed before me.`
`I parked my bicycle and walked down the mountain of trash and scrap.`
`This place is my castle.`
`It would be incredible if anyone else came to this mountain of trash.`
`I've come here many times and I usually stay for a long while, but I've never seen anybody walk by.`
`This place is the village's blind spot.`
`I heard that many people came here all the time during the dam wars, but it was abandoned after that.`
`The villagers no longer need to come here, and some people even forgot about it entirely.`
`It seems like they dump trash here at midnight, but I've never seen a truck actually dumping trash, at least.`
`If they dumped new trash more often, it'd give me more time to kill.`
`...But it looks like it's not going to happen for a while.`
`I walked down the slope of the trash pile, all the way down to the bottom, and headed behind another pile.`
`Nobody ever comes here.`
`I've come here many times and I usually stay for a long while, but nobody has ever come to mess up this place.`
`Not even the other kids from my school come here.`
`They all believe that the arm of the manager of the construction site is buried somewhere in the trash piles, and they also believe the whole place is haunted.`
`They told me that a ghost with one arm still wanders around here, looking for his missing limb.`
`Sadly, I haven't seen the ghost either.`
`I'm not scared.`
`In fact, I'd rather like to meet him.`
`I wouldn't mind helping him find his arm.`
`If he's feeling lonely, I'd want him to be my conversation partner.`
`There's a station wagon buried in the trash pile.`
`It doesn't have tires, but other than that, it still looks like a station wagon.`
`This station wagon is my secret hideout.`
`Unfortunately, the sliding door and rear doors don't open.`
`So, whenever I want to get in, I have to enter the car from the passenger seat and crawl into the back from there.`
`Of course, I take off my shoes at the passenger's seat.`
`When you look at it from the outside, it's just a dirty abandoned car.`
`But on the inside, it's nice and clean, because I had swept it out and decorated a little.`
` That took me a long time.`
`The back seats are lying flat because I wanted to have as much space as possible.`
`I found a mattress in the trash pile and put it into that space instead.`
`It was a bit dirty, so I brought a bed sheet from home and covered the mattress with it.`
`I put my favorite cushions on top, and with that, it turned into a perfect bed.`
`I've put cushions and stuffed animals everywhere.`
`That's not all. Look at this.`
` Ehehe, I have a bunch of sweets here, too.`
`I have a bag of fruit candy in four different colors,`
` and some cookies...`
` but they're going bad. I'll have to throw them away.`
`My bear-shaped water bottle was empty.`
`When I come here to spend some time on Sundays, I usually bring this water bottle with some sweetened tea in it.`
`I have a box of tissues, a flashlight, extra batteries, and other daily necessities in here.`
`I also have a few books to read in order to kill some time while I'm at it.`
`And I have this.`
` What do you think this is?`
` Look. Ta-dah!`
`My hideout is suddenly lit up, thanks to the table lamp.`
`There's an electric outlet on the side of an old nearby construction office.`
`I'd thought they'd have cut the power years ago, but to my surprise, I was wrong.`
`Electricity is still being supplied to the outlet.`
`When I found tons of extension cords, I came up with the idea to connect them all and make the electricity come all the way to my hideout.`
`Now I can spend time here comfortably with some sweets, books, and lights.`
`If I wanted to, I might be able to spend a night here.`
`...But, I may catch a cold since it gets very cold at night.`
`Aha ha ha ha.`
` See? This is a very nice hideout, isn't it?`
`At first, I thought somebody would find it and mess with it.`
` But that hasn't happened so far.`
`That's because nobody comes here, and everybody forgot about this place.`
`That's how this place became my perfect secret hideout.`
`Fortunately, I ate so much today that I'm still full.`
`I can tell them that I was playing with my friend at her house and ate dinner there.`
`I'm going to stay here for a while and relax.`
`And I'm going to treat myself.`
`I loved the water gun battle yesterday.`
`My heart had been pounding when I fought one-on-one with Keiichi-kun.`
`I also had great fun at Angel Mort today.`
`I'd never experienced such a crazy game with so many people in my life.`
`I was still feeling the aftereffects, and I was sure I'd have a dream about it tonight.`
`That was why`
` I wanted to bask in these happy feelings.`
`That was why I'm going to treat myself in here.`
`I should take off my shoes and stretch my toes.`
`I should cherish the time when I can be myself.`
`"Mmmmmmmmm..."`
`Once I took off my shoes, I felt so relaxed that I didn't want to put them on again.`
`I played all day today, and I was very tired.`
` The treasure hunt could wait.`
`As it got darker, the light of the table lamp became encouraging.`
`It really was getting dark faster than usual.`
`...All of a sudden, I heard the sound of raindrops hitting the roof of the car.`
`Pitter patter. Pitter patter pitter patter.`
` ...The interval between drops got shorter and shorter.`
`When it became a continuous sound, I began to hear thunder.`
`Even though it was raining heavily, it remained very quiet inside the car, making me feel like I was in a different world.`
`It's my castle, after all.`
`I felt a bit cold, so I unfolded my big blanket and hid under it.`
`I'm here alone, under the warm blanket that has my scent. `
`Even though nobody knew where I was at the moment and I feel like I was left alone in the heavy rain, I still feel secure and free from anxiety for some reason.`
`I felt like this heavy rain was keeping my enemies away from my castle. I liked it that way.`
`This place is full of small happiness.`
`It's full of my favorite things.`
`That's why I'm happy whenever I'm here.`
`...When I put another blanket over me, I felt as warm as if I were in bed.`
`I listened to the soothing sounds of raindrops hitting the scrap iron in the trash heaps, and it made me feel sleepy.`
`This is a castle of trash.`
`This trash came here because nobody wanted it.`
`This is where it lives.`
`This is a country where unwanted refuse lives together.`
`I felt like I fit in here,`
` but at the same time... I knew it was just a temporary place for me, as there's somewhere I had to go back to.`
`...No. I shouldn't think about things like that.`
`Whenever I realize that I don't belong here,`
`...I remember I'm in the middle of a very dirty pile of trash...`
`I should just doze for a little bit longer.`
`...Thinking is poisonous.`
`I wanted to keep myself out of that poison, so that the kind Rena within me could stay pure.`
`A little bit longer.`
` Just a little bit longer... and I closed my eyes...`
