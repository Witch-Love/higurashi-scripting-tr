`"Hey! Good morning, Rena.`
` You're late today!"`
`"Ahahahahaha, you're just early today, Keiichi-kun."`
`"I'm not trying to put aside the fact that I'm always late, but it feels good to defeat you once in a while."`
`"Hau,`
` I slept in this morning.`
`I couldn't sleep last night."`
`"Oh, you too?`
` Nahahahaha, same here.`
` I was still feeling yesterday's uproar.`
` It took me a long time to go to sleep."`
`Yesterday, I had a lot of fun with my friends and went home still riding that high.`
`I was too full to eat dinner.`
`I kept talking with my parents about the great time I had over the past few days.`
`I was so pumped up that I couldn't go to sleep. Kinda sounds like I'm a little kid...`
`But, given that Rena seemed to be the same way, I felt better about it.`
`...No, "I felt better" isn't the right way of phrasing it. I should say "I'm glad" to know that we shared the same feeling.`
`Rena went treasure hunting after I left. I'm sure she found many adorable things, went home,`
` and talked with her parents about how great the day was.`
`"Hey, Mii-chan!`
` Good morning!!"`
`"Oh, you're here early! Better watch out for the pigs falling from the sky!"`
`"I know I usually make you wait for me, but do you really have to say it like that?"`
`"Ahaha, Keiichi-kun was unusually early this morning.`
`Today is full of miracles!"`
`"Aha ha ha!`
` You're one to talk yourself!"`
`It's going to be another happy day today.`
`I had fun the day before yesterday.`
` I had fun yesterday.`
` So, I'm going to have fun today for sure.`
`I'm happy, and Mion is happy too.`
`Of course, Rena and my other friends are equally happy.`
`I'm not afraid to say it,`
` and I wish these happy days would last forever.`
`"Hey, Mion.`
` What are we playing today?"`
`"What, for club?`
`Hmmmmmmm, I don't know yet.`
` Rena, do you have any ideas?"`
`"Let's see...`
`We've been playing athletic games for the past few days, so I'd say something not athletic."`
`"You're right.`
` That's a very good point.`
` Our club is not only about athletic performance, is it?"`
`"Of course it's not!`
` Our club members have to have brains, skill, and brawn to boot!`
` So, why don't we play some tabletop games today?"`
`Everybody was early this morning.`
` We could enjoy our walk to school for once.`
`After a while, we started talking about the upcoming festival.`
`They told me that the festival was called "Watanagashi", and that it's the biggest event of the year in Hinamizawa.`
`"Yesterday, my relatives gathered at my house in Okinomiya.`
` And they started talking about you, Kei-chan."`
`"What? Me?`
` What did the great people of the Sonozaki family talk about...?"`
`"Well...`
` my Uncle Yoshiroh is the store manager of Angel Mort, and he saw your performance yesterday.`
` He really likes you now.`
`So, I started asking the others if they had heard of you, and I found out that most of them did!`
` They said you're famous in Hinamizawa."`
`"Famous? Doesn't sound like they meant it in a good way...`
` I'm probably more infamous to them because of the punishments you made me do."`
`"It's not only that. `
`They said that you blend in well, that you're full of energy, and that you're a little bit reckless. They said it's rare for a young man in this era to have all those qualities. They were very impressed with you."`
`I felt... a bit embarrassed to know that people I haven't even met were speaking well of me.`
`"And so, they want you to do something at the Watanagashi festival.`
` You like to draw people's attention, don't you?"`
`"Hey!`
` Don't assume things, and don't decide anything without me!`
` Don't you know I'm a quiet, lonely guy who loves to be alone?"`
`"Ah hahahahaha ha!!`
` Lonely guy?`
`You mean 'loan boy', don't you?`
` Heh heh heh heh!"`
`"Hau... Keiichi-kun being a loan boy...`
` If you are having trouble with money we can help you... Hau..."`
`"Whooooaaaaah!!`
` Stop talking about nasty things! Ladies don't talk about things like that!!"`
`We really were still feeling the aftereffects of yesterday.`
`Mion and I made a lot of noise teasing each other on the way to school.`
`Rena watched us and laughed happily.`
`Satoko and Rika-chan were already there when we arrived at school. They were also full of energy.`
`Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun were too. From that, I can tell that they also had a good time yesterday.`
`Everybody has been having a good time, really.`
` In Hinamizawa, everybody is happy.`
`"...It hasn't even been a year yet since I moved here, but..."`
`"Hm? What is it?"`
`"Well... I'm just glad that I moved here."`
`"Aha ha ha ha!`
` What's wrong, Kei-chan? You're being sentimental."`
`"I understand.`
` I understand exactly how you feel. You feel like everything is perfect, that you've become happy since you moved to Hinamizawa. `
`...I think this village has some kind of power to make people feel that way."`
`"Are you happy, Rena?"`
`"Yes.`
` I'm happy every day here in Hinamizawa."`
`"Yeah, me too."`
`"...H-Hey!`
` Don't leave this ol' man out in the cold!`
` Let me in on the conversation too!"`
`The sky was clear, and the few thin clouds were pure white.`
`The cry of the cicadas was telling me that summer would be coming earlier than usual.`
`Watanagashi is just around the corner.`
`I'm sure we'll have great fun at the festival too.`
`There will be more and more fun days to come, I'm sure of it.`
`Summer is just around the corner.`
`The last class of the day was finally over, meaning that it was time for club activities.`
`I was sure it would be fun.`
`I couldn't wait.`
`But then Mii-chan received a call and told us something had come up and she had to go. So, we didn't have a club meeting today.`
`...Tsk.`
` ...I was really looking forward to it.`
`There was nothing I could do,`
` but I could at least chat with Keiichi-kun on the way home. It'll be fun.`
`Keiichi-kun sometimes says mean things, but he's very funny.`
`When I chat with him, my depression goes away.`
`...Wait, what did I just say?`
`Am I... depressed...?`
`I have so much fun every day, and I'm as happy as I can be.`
` ...What did I have to be depressed about?`
`...Well, it was obvious.`
`Because of Rina-san, my father is happy now.`
`Before he met her, he was like a lamp in broad daylight.`
`Honestly, he was like the living dead.`
`But after he met Rina-san, he started to smile like he used to when he was living with my mother.`
`He enjoyed talking with her and started going out with her.`
` You could probably say they went on dates.`
` Now, he looks ten, no, twenty years younger.`
`Rina-san gets along with my father very well... and she's very kind to me, too.`
`There's actually...`
` no reason for me to hate her.`
`But`
`......`
` the bitter memories of my parents' divorce`
` and my many regrets`
` were gradually eating away at my heart.`
`Was it okay to accept that woman?`
`Rina-san might be the same as`
` how Uncle Akihito...`
` turned out to be...`
`Is she the enemy who takes my happiness away with her very existence...`
` with or without bad intentions?`
`Am I going to sit around until everything collapses again?`
`Should I fight`
` the enemy`
` ...before it's too late?`
`Rina-san... comes to my house a little too... obviously.`
`Since my father started letting her stay the night, many of her belongings have turned up in the house.`
`My father and I don't smoke, but there's an ashtray in the living room.`
`The futon in our guest room is hers now.`
`In the bathroom, there's a toothbrush`
` and shampoo I'd never choose to buy.`
`I started to feel awkward about those things...`
` and that's when I started noticing it at the front door when I came home from school.`
` Her perfume.`
`I asked my father once if he was thinking about getting married to Rina-san.`
`He looked a little embarrassed, perplexed, and confused. He told me, "not yet."`
`He knew I was hurt by the divorce.`
`That's probably why he couldn't admit that he wanted to remarry.`
`...That's why he said, "not yet."`
`He'd consider it, but not while I was still living with him.`
` That's what he meant, I guess.`
`There's only one reason why I don't want him to get remarried to Rina-san.`
`I feel offended that my sanctum, my family, is being invaded.`
`I might be being selfish, though.`
`I know keeping my father all to myself means...`
` keeping him miserable like he was before he met Rina-san.`
`He has a life to live too.`
`It's his right to heal from the pain from the divorce and to live, to find his new love.`
`He wouldn't have had to go through that painful life if I'd prevented the divorce from happening in the first place.`
`He has a right to a happy new life that lets him forget the pain he never deserved, and I don't have any right to stop him.`
`...In fact, I have an obligation to try to return his happiness to him.`
`...I have to pay for my sin, my inability to prevent his divorce.`
`Then, what should I do to make both of us happy?`
`...It wouldn't be that difficult.`
`All I'd need to do would be to give my silent approval of their relationship.`
`My father tells me he won't get remarried while we live together.`
`That means I should stop leaning on my family, be strong, and live on my own as soon as I can.`
`Although, that doesn't mean I can tell him not to go out with her until that day.`
`Rina-san comes to our house to see him despite her busy schedule, and she even stays the night whenever her shifts permit.`
` ...They're adults.`
` I have no right to say anything against that.`
`That's why...`
`That's why I chose to give my silent approval to their relationship`
` and tried to see her as little as I could.`
`I get along with Rina-san on the surface.`
`...I know my father would have a hard time keeping face if we didn't.`
`But, it's a very exhausting and painful thing to get along with a person I don't really like.`
`So, whenever Rina-san comes over, I spend as much time as possible outside, then head home late.`
`Mii-chan's club activities are the most convenient things to do to kill time.`
` But there are some days we don't have a club meeting.`
`On those days, I while away my time at the garbage dump, hunting for treasure alone.`
`And... that's how I started to make my secret hideout.`
`My father can do whatever he wants with Rina-san at home.`
`I don't have to see them together. I can spend my time peacefully at my hideout.`
`......I sometimes feel depressed about my life.`
`I sometimes want to talk to somebody about it.`
`But... nothing will change, even if I talk to somebody.`
` This is all I can really do.`
`The most important thing for me should be to overcome the sadness of losing my family as fast as I could, and to regain my own happiness.`
`I have so much fun every day. I'm happy every day.`
`...Even on the way home, Keiichi-kun was talking about funny things that made me laugh.`
`My feeling gloomy in spite of that was kind of rude.`
`My father should be happy.`
`I should be happy.`
`I just feel sad because I still can't separate from my father.`
`Compared to the unexpectedness of the divorce, Rina-san's invasion is a very slow process.`
`I think Rina-san understands how I feel.`
`She treats me very kindly, but she doesn't do more than that.`
`I think she understands that I'd feel uncomfortable if she did.`
`I respect Rika-chan, because she's strong even without her parents.`
`Compared to the pain of losing both her parents unexpectedly, my problem is like nothing.`
`I respect Satoko-chan's toughness, too. She also lost her parents and was forced to live a painful life under her uncle and aunt.`
`Compared to the cruel treatment she had to go through, my relationship with Rina-san is a blessed one.`
`...I keep feeling anxious, but that's just because`
` I'm still immature, and because I feel like I'm not ready to separate from my father.`
`I have to be strong like Rika-chan and Satoko-chan.`
`I have to try my best to be happy.`
`I'm going to live with all my might...`
` in order to regain the peace of mind that I lost that day.`
`My assumption that I'm not happy is just a mistake.`
`I should appreciate the wonderful days I spend with my wonderful friends.`
`Just by realizing that I'm happy, the world shines so brightly.`
`"Listen! Listen!`
` It was just sho kyute, so I screamed, 'I'm taking it home with me!!'"`
`"Ahh hahahahaha... I bet you did.`
` You're an expert at making the most out of every day."`
`"I am, aren't I?`
` I feel very fortunate to have a wonderful life and wonderful friends. How could I be unhappy?"`
`"You're right.`
` In Hinamizawa, nobody becomes unhappy.`
` Everybody stays happy!`
`Hinamizawa is free from misfortunes!"`
`He should've stopped right there.`
` But, he just kept going.`
`"I'm jealous of you, Rena.`
` I wish I could be an idiotic optimist like you!"`
`"...Hau...`
` It sounds like you're insulting me......`
` But, if that's what I need to make every day wonderful... I wouldn't mind.`
` ...Would I?"`
`I don't have any worries.`
`I feel like I do, but that's just because I'm immature and still want my father's attention.`
`Come on.`
`Say the magical words.`
` It'll cheer you up.`
`"Hau..."`
`"Hum?"`
`It didn't make sense to say it now, but I was going to say it anyway, because this is my magical phrase that always cheers me up.`
`"Hauuuu☆!`
` I'm taking it home with me!!!"`
`"Ahahahahaha, what's wrong with you?`
` That's so like you, but still!"`
`That's right.`
` This is me, Rena.`
`I'm not Reina. Reina still wants her parents' attention.`
`...Rena is a goofy and carefree girl. She knows that every day is full of happiness and she has the kind heart to appreciate it, too.`
`I should forget about icky things.`
`I should live a wonderful life free of anything icky.`
`"Icky" starts with "I".`
` ...And that's why I got rid of the "I" in "Reina".`
`I'm Rena.`
`I'm going to recapture the happiness I lost when I left Hinamizawa.`
`I will overcome any pain and hardship.`
`I can be happy.`
`Because I got rid of 'i'-cky things.`
`I'm sure there are only incredible things waiting for me.`
`......Oh.`
` "Incredible" starts with "I", too.`
`.........`
`I was almost home... and when my house appeared, I noticed something different there.`
`There was a truck parked in front of my house.`
`There was nothing on the back of it, but I can tell it brought something here, because I saw some cardboard boxes, blankets, and ropes on the ground.`
`From the front of the house, I heard voices of two young men saying,`
` "Well, we'll be going now."`
`They passed me by as I walked towards the front door.`
`They were wearing some kind of work uniforms. They looked like delivery people.`
`My father was about to close the door when he noticed me.`
`"Hey, I'm home.`
` ......What's going on?"`
`"Oh, Reina.`
` I have a surprise for you."`
`My father looked to be in a good mood.`
`I didn't know why he was, but whenever he smiled like that I just wanted to smile back at him.`
`His eyes used to look like those of a dead fish no matter how hard I tried to smile at him...`
`But these days, he could put on a big smile just to surprise me.`
`He has been literally coming back to life since a year ago when we moved back to Hinamizawa... no, since he started dating Rina-san.`
`When I see him smile like this, I'm happy. But at the same time, I feel confused because I don't know whether I should thank Rina-san or not.`
`"Look, doesn't it look great?"`
`He took me to the living room.`
`He was probably expecting me to go all "ohh" and "ahh".`
`So, whether there was something in the living room or not, I was ready to go "ohh" and "ahh" for him.`
`"...Wow.`
` What...`
` What is this?`
` ...Wh-What did you do?"`
`I tried to sound excited and surprised.`
`He was standing behind me, probably smiling with satisfaction at hearing my excited voice.`
`I, on the other hand... was desperately trying to understand what was going on.`
`For a moment, I thought I was in someone else's house.`
`You see, the living room had been completely redecorated.`
`The furniture we had was all basically from the former house in Ibaraki.`
`My parents bought most of the furniture when they got married, so it was all old and a little dirty.`
`Some of them still had crayon scribbles I drew when I was very little.`
`But all of that was gone.`
`Everything in the living room had turned a pastel color, looking very sophisticated like the rooms you'd see in soap operas.`
`The new carpet looked very tropical.`
`The new curtains matched with the carpet.`
`The new sofa looked very expensive.`
`...The living room, in general, looked like a resort hotel.`
`The channel switcher of our old TV was broken, and we used to have to use pliers to change channels. But it was gone too, replaced by a new one with a big screen.`
`The room's lights had also been replaced by nicer-looking ones.`
`The living room looked like a totally different world under the new fluorescent lights.`
`"Th-This looks great, Dad.`
` What made you do this?"`
`"I did it to get a fresh start.`
` It's been a year since we moved here. I thought it was time for me to reboot and finally start a new life."`
`I suggested redecorating the house once in order to cheer him up, because he was still in pain after the divorce.`
`But he wasn't interested at the time.`
` ...He didn't want to get rid of the old furniture he had chosen with my mother, because he still couldn't get over her even though she cruelly broke up with him.`
`I wanted to suggest it again when the time was right...`
` I never thought he'd do it on his own initiative.`
`"That was a good idea.`
` Ahahahaha, this beautiful living room makes me feel refreshed.`
` I love it!"`
`"I knew you would.`
` Reina, you always wanted to have a rocking chair, didn't you?`
` I haven't set it up yet, but look!`
` I got it for you!"`
`"Hauuuuu!!`
` Dad, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!`
` This is mine, right? Right?"`
`"Hey, this is for everybody. Not just for you, Reina.`
` Ahahahahaahaha!"`
`"I understand, but I'm not going to get off the chair once I sit on it!`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`My father explained the details of his redecoration proudly.`
`He told me that he only did the living room this time, but he's going to redecorate all of the rooms.`
`He sure had become more active.`
`There are some parts about the redecoration I didn't like, but I still thought it was great, because it made him happy.`
`I found the old furniture...`
` outside in the yard.`
`"Are you going to... throw them away?"`
`"Yeah, I think we should.`
` A delivery company is coming later to pick them up."`
`Getting rid of the old furniture means putting an end to my mother.`
`...I hated the furniture because it smelled like my mother, and I tried to break everything once.`
`I understand why my father wants to take this opportunity to get rid of them.`
`But......`
` ...for some reason, this new living room makes me feel like`
` I no longer belonged here.`
`My father didn't choose the new furniture.`
` Rina-san probably did.`
`Most likely, my father and Rina-san decided to redecorate the living room and went to a furniture store to buy everything.`
`...I tried to think positively. The reason why my father didn't tell me about the redecoration was because he wanted to surprise me.`
`...No... My father never really considers things that deeply.`
`So, I suppose he didn't tell me because he just didn't think he needed to tell me.`
`...I'm sure he didn't redecorate the living room to make me feel like I was no longer welcome.`
`Don't be negative, Rena...`
`My father didn't have any bad intentions... He doesn't want to get rid of me... He doesn't think I'm the reason he can't get remarried...`
`And yet.`
`...Why did I feel sad... looking at the old furniture in the yard?`
` Why did I feel like I didn't belong?`
`I realized the reason... right away.`
`That reason was me.`
`To him, wanting to have a fresh start by getting rid of the things that remind him of my mother might be......`
` an indication of his unconscious desire to get rid of her daughter.`
`...My father doesn't really consider things deeply, so he might not be thinking that I'm the reason he can't get remarried.`
`...But, he understands that he can't get remarried while we live together.`
`...By staying with him, I'm torturing my father.`
`It was my fault that he had to get a divorce...`
`That's why I have to support him, to help recapture his happiness.`
`I couldn't just keep him all to myself.`
`I'd have to start thinking about living on my own.`
`...I don't need to go to university. I should think about getting a job.`
`But who would hire an uneducated girl like me?`
`Even if somebody did hire me, I wouldn't be able to earn enough money to live on my own.`
`...Maybe I should think about working at a hostess club...`
` like Rina-san does.`
`People only choose the jobs they can.`
`...A girl like me doesn't have a lot of choices.`
` Not a lot of companies would hire me or pay the amount of money that I'd need to live on my own......`
` But............`
`Come to think of it`
`......`
` where is the place where I belong?`
`Whenever I end up feeling like this... I miss my secret hideout in the trash piles.`
`I love to get under my blanket and feel the warmth on a cold night.`
`The hideout gets hot and humid during the day and very cold at night. It's not a comfortable place to spend time in.`
`...But it might be the place where I can relax the most... more than I can at my house.`
`No.`
` I shouldn't think like this.`
`I shouldn't think that my house has been invaded by Rina-san.`
` I should thank her for making my father happy.`
` Rina-san isn't trying to kick me out of the house.`
` She's trying to get along with me. `
`But I'm not opening my heart to her.`
`I'm the bad one.`
` I'm the bad one.`
`And I'm blessed.`
` I'm blessed.`
`Satoshi-kun and his aunt didn't get along at all, and she abused him for a long time. ......Compared to him, my situation is a lot easier.`
`Satoko-chan and Rika-chan lost their parents, and they live together now. They've been through very hard times. On the other hand, I still live with my father. I should feel blessed.`
`I shouldn't think I'm unhappy just because of these things.`
`I am happy.`
` I am blessed.`
`The trouble with me is that I still can't admit that I'm happy...`
`My father kept talking proudly about the redecoration.`
`I nodded at him with a big smile and let him keep at it.`
`"Oh, I almost forgot...`
` Reina, can I ask you a favor?"`
`"Sure.`
` What is it?"`
`"I ordered two jackets from the clothing store.`
` It seems like they came in today.`
` I have to help the delivery company pick up the furniture, so can you go get the jackets for me?"`
`"Sure.`
` Which store is it?`
` I wonder what kind of jackets you got.`
` I can't wait to see them!"`
`No matter what they look like, I'm sure Rina-san picked them out for him.`
`Although I don't mind going.`
`I'd rather go to the store than listen to his stories about the redecoration of our living room.`
`I got the receipt, asked him where the store is, changed my clothes, and left the house.`
`...I started pedaling my bicycle, and looked at the old furniture in the yard for the last time.`
`They used to be the object of my hatred, but for some reason... they now made me feel sentimental.`
`...Is it because I still regret the loss of my mother, even though I hate her?`
`I couldn't let poisonous emotions take over my heart.`
`...I understood that in my mind, but I just couldn't get rid of that feeling.`
`The old furniture wasn't the only stuff that was kicked out of the house.`
`There was also a lot of junk that I brought home from the landfill.`
`My father was probably going to throw that away, too.`
`He doesn't like the junk I collect.`
` He'll probably let the delivery company take it all together with the old furniture.`
`...Just like an animal that rubs its scent on its home in order to feel secure,`
` I collected all the junk in order to make sure that I could stay here.`
`No, that's not it.`
`...I wanted to bring them to my house because they were abandoned by their former owners.`
`And they needed a place to live.`
