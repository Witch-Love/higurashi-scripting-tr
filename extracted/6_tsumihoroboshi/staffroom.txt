`Hello, my name is Ryukishi07.`
`I hope you enjoyed playing Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.6 Tsumihoroboshi.`
`There are several themes I wanted to write in this chapter, but I'd like to talk about one of them here.`
`It's about the denial of murder.`
`This is something I had to write sooner or later, since this is a novel about serial murders.`
`There are two means that youngsters in particular use these days to solve problems, which are "murder" and "suicide".`
`When we feel stress, we choose to either get rid of the source of the stress or to get away from it.`
`Let's say you're bullied by a kid at school.`
`You have two ways to solve the problem.`
` You choose either to <i>get rid of</i> the kid from your current environment`
` or to <i>get away</i> from the environment itself.`
`Usually, bullies are stronger and have their underlings, so you don't stand a chance alone to <i>get rid of</i> them.`
`It's also not easy to switch classes or to quit school, so you can't easily <i>get away</i> from the situation.`
`As a result, the situation gets worse day by day, and your stress urges you to solve the problem immediately.`
`And you come up with "murder" or "suicide" as easy solutions.`
`If suicide is considered defeat, you'd want to consider murder.`
`I feel like there are many people who think that way.`
`However, if you actually committed a murder, it wouldn't be easy to pay for the sin.`
`I believe murderers know that well, too.`
`But, you really hate the bully who pushed you to the limit where you have no choice but to kill him. So, with a determination that turns your entire life upside down, you commit murder.`
`But if you have such strong determination,`
` there have to be more ways to take than opting for murder, which should be the last resort.`
`You can talk to your friends.`
`If that doesn't work, you can talk to your family.`
`If that doesn't work, you can talk to your teacher.`
` ...If that doesn't work... then what?`
`There have to be more ways.`
`If you have the determination to give up on your life by committing murder, there have to be more ways!`
`Our modern era is better than any era before it.`
` There are many hotlines that you can call to talk to someone.`
` Even if you don't have any friends or family, there are many places you can go for help.`
`The people who will answer the phone aren't amateurs.`
`They're volunteers, but they're also veterans who have worked as social workers or juvenile counselors for a long time.`
`I can assure you that they have more social experience and passion than your parents do.`
`People who work to help people for free can't be bad people!`
`If you feel like you have no choice but to kill the bully or commit suicide, please try to call those hotlines.`
`People who think it's useless to talk to others usually haven't really talked to anyone.`
`Have the courage to call.`
`There will be somebody you can completely rely on at the other end of the line.`
`Don't keep it to yourself. Talk to somebody.`
`Ryukishi07 wrote such a long story just to tell you this. He must be a very poor writer.`
`So, Ryukishi07 wants to talk to you all, rather than worrying all by himself.`
`How can I write even more entertaining stories...? (bitter laugh)`
