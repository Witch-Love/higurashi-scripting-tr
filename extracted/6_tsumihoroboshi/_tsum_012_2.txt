`Rena had been sick ever since that day, and she hadn't been able to join in on club activities as often since.`
`"...Yeah.`
` I still feel feverish."`
`"...You do, huh...`
` That's a pity..."`
`"Hey, Rena!`
` Why don't you just try and play with us today?`
` I think you'll feel a lot better if you blow off some steam with us."`
`"Mm-hm, you got this ol' man's agreement."`
`"...Do you think so? Do you?"`
`"......Sometimes, resting too much is bad for you."`
`"They're quite correct.`
` All illness comes from the mind, don't you know?"`
`Everybody had suspected for a while that Rena isn't really sick, at least physically.`
`It's just that many things happened to her at once. She caught a mental cold.`
`That's why I thought she would get better once she played with us, just like we used to.`
`It seemed like Rena was aware of that, too.`
`She knew that she had to get out of her state of depression soon. She wanted to get better, and she wanted to have fun again every day.`
`"...Okay!`
` I'll do it!"`
`"Great!`
` That's the spirit!`
`Considering the fact that Rena is still recovering from her illness, let's play a tabletop game today.`
`...Let me see... Let me see..."`
`Mion started rummaging through her locker, humming to herself.`
`She took one game after another from the locker, and put them aside.`
`That locker definitely didn't obey the laws of physics.`
`The amount of games she took out from the locker was more than what it could physically hold.`
`"Oh, I forgot about this one.`
` Let's try this.`
`Today, we'll be playing this detective game!"`
`"Oh!!`
` What's that?`
` Sounds interesting!"`
`"Well, this is a game where you guess the culprit, the murder weapon, and the scene of the crime.`
` It's a game where you use your brain."`
`"......You'll pick it up as you play.`
` All you need to do is to note down the information you have."`
`"Ho ho ho!`
` In other words, you need to learn the trick of note-taking!`
` This is a game for intelligent people like myself!!"`
`The rules don't seem that difficult.`
`In short, it's a game where you sound out the cards each player holds in order to try and reason out the identity of the cards first drawn out of the deck.`
`There are plenty of games in different formats where you try to identify something hidden in the least number of steps.`
` This one just happens to be a competitive one of those.`
`The key to winning this game would be how well you can organize your information.`
`...We usually like to play athletic games so that we can run around a lot, but in our club, you have to excel both academically and athletically.`
`"Alright, alright! This is gonna be great!!`
` Let's play!!`
` Rena, do you remember how we still haven't decided the winner of the water gun battle? I'm going to settle it today once and for all!"`
`"Oh, are you?`
`Then I'm not going to go easy on you!!"`
`"......If Rena is getting serious, I'll have to get serious, too."`
`"Yes indeed!`
` Since that water gun battle, I have reevaluated Keiichi-san and Rena-san.`
` I'm going to be merciless today!!"`
`"Ah ha ha ha!`
` This is getting exciting!!`
` This ol' man's been waiting for everyone to get this fired up!`
` Excellent!`
` Let's do this!!"`
`"Are you ready?`
`'I'`
` did it with a 'Knife'`
` in the 'Library'."`
`"Okay!`
`My turn.`
` 'Keiichi-kun'`
` did it with 'Poison'`
` in the 'Hall'!"`
`"My turn...`
` 'Mion'`
` did it with a 'Pistol'`
` in the 'Lounge'!"`
`"...Heh heh heh!`
` You're holding the 'Pistol', aren't you?`
` You're bluffing!"`
`"......I think I know the suspect and the murder weapon.`
` I've narrowed the scene of the crime down to two."`
`"Hau!`
` You're good, Rika-chan.`
` I've narrowed the suspect down to two, but it's hard to pin down which one it is!"`
`"I'll give you a tip. There's always a hint in the questions the other players ask you.`
` If you figure it out, you can even solve the whole mystery by the order of the cards the others put down on the table!"`
`"I-I see!`
` Damn it, I underestimated the depth of this game!`
` ...Oh no... My notes are such a mess! I can't even read my own handwriting!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Once you acquire the skill of note-taking, you'll have a 70% chance to win this game.`
`But even a 70% chance won't be enough to defeat me!"`
`I kind of knew I didn't stand a chance of winning this game, but I gradually started picking it up.`
`Rena seemed to be getting her energy back as she played along.`
`It was the right decision to force her to play with us today.`
`While we were in the middle of the game, Chie-sensei came into the classroom.`
`"My, you look like you're having fun.`
` Anyway, is Ryuugu-san here?"`
`"Hau?"`
`"You have a visitor."`
`Everybody looked puzzled.`
`...Parents sometimes showed up at school for some reason, but Chie-sensei never called them "visitors".`
`...It's rare to have a visitor at school.`
`"...I wonder who it is.`
` Well, I have to go.`
` You can continue without me!"`
`Rena left the classroom at a run.`
`"...What should we do?`
` Should we wait for her?"`
`"Well, we don't know how long it's going to take.`
`Rena told us we could continue.`
` So, let's do that!"`
`"""Yeah!!"""`
`Around the entrance, the glaring sun and the cool shade made for a clear contrast.`
`An old man who's holding his jacket on his arm was waiting for me. He looked like he was overheating, and his tie was limp.`
`"Are you Ryuugu-san?`
` Reina Ryuugu-san."`
`Ever since Rina called me Reina, I've hated that name more than ever. Because of that, I didn't have a good first impression of this man.`
`"Yes, that's me.`
` ...May I ask who you are?"`
`"My car has air conditioning, so why don't we move this into there?`
` Aren't you hot out here?"`
`He ignored my question and started walking towards the car parked in front of the school gate.`
`...If he wanted to talk about something normal, he would've used the teacher's office.`
`But he wanted to talk in his car instead. I couldn't help but feel suspicious.`
`Chie-sensei let him see me, though.`
`That meant he wasn't a suspicious individual as far as she was concerned.`
`...Who was he...?`
`"I don't bite, you know.`
` Please, this way."`
`He called out to me while opening the rear door.`
`...Is he a policeman...?`
`Did... the police find out that I killed those two...?`
`I felt anxious all of a sudden.`
`...Was this what they called a "voluntary interview"?`
`...I didn't want to go in that car. But if I rejected his offer, it'd only make me look suspicious.`
`I prepared myself`
` ...and got in.`
`It was really cool inside the car.`
`A car A/C must cost a fortune.`
` At least, my father's car doesn't have one.`
`"Please let me know if it's too cold.`
` I like keeping it that way."`
`"So, what's this talk about?"`
`In retaliation, I ignored his question and got to the point like he did.`
`He pulled a small notebook out of his breast pocket and flipped through it. He picked out a photo from it.`
`The photo showed... the face of a goofy-looking man.`
`"Please tell me if there's anything you know about this person."`
`The man in the picture was expressionless and looked half asleep.`
`Sometimes you can't even recognize your own family members in a photo where they don't have an expression.`
`...So there's no way I would recognize a person who wasn't related to me.`
`......But anyway, that was a bit of a relief.`
` ...This had nothing to do with Rina or her partner.`
`"There were scribbles on his shirt,`
` and we found the signatures of students at this school, including yours, Ryuugu-san."`
`"...Eh...... Is this... Tomitake-san?!"`
`I don't feel his usual carefree unreliableness from this picture at all.`
` From this half-awake, emotionless face...`
`"How about this woman, then?"`
`I knew what he was going to show.`
`"Her name is Miyo-san.`
` Miyo Takano-san."`
`"When did you see them last?"`
`"I think it was right after the Watanagashi festival."`
`"Didn't you notice anything strange?`
` Anything.`
` Please tell me."`
`"Did something happen to them?"`
`"Yeah!!`
` I got it!!`
` To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure if it was 'Rena' or 'Mion'."`
`"So, you gambled?!`
`...How risky...!"`
`"......It doesn't matter how he won. What matters is that he won."`
`"Oh, Rena.`
` Welcome back!`
` What took you so long?"`
`Mion noticed that Rena had returned.`
`She looked exhausted.`
`...I have no idea what she talked about with the visitor, but it was obvious it wasn't something fun.`
`"Rena... are you okay?"`
`"...What?`
` What's okay?`
` What?"`
`"I'm talking about you.`
` You look pale.`
` ...Are you sure you're alright?"`
`Rena tried to convince us she was fine, but her face clouded over for a moment and she decided to leave early.`
`...I shouldn't have forced her to join the game.`
`I was regretting it a little.`
` Rena probably forced herself to play with us, even though she wasn't feeling well at all.`
`Rena put her stuff in her bag, apologized to us for leaving early, and left the classroom.`
`"Well, she's gone now.`
` ...I guess we have to keep playing until we have a loser!"`
`"That's right!`
` Whose turn is it?"`
`"......Meep!"`
`"Okay, Rika-chan!`
` Come on!!!"`
