`"Calm down, Maebara Keiichi.`
` Think!`
` Think hard!!"`
`Keiichi-kun held his head, screamed that line, and bent his neck backwards.`
`When he gets like this, he always speaks everything that's on his mind, and it's very fun to listen to.`
`But I had to concentrate. I needed to win this game!!`
`I was going to keep eating as much as I can and take all of the adorable girls home with me!!!!`
`Ahahahahahaha...☆.`
`I was having so much fun.`
` I was so thrilled that I felt like my heart was about to burst.`
`I might have been acting totally uncute...`
` but I didn't care, exactly because I was having so much fun.`
`Mii-chan always comes up with such extraordinary games.`
`Satoko-chan loves to play pranks.`
`Rika-chan is very sneaky, but it's impossible to hate her.`
`And Keiichi-kun is always so funny.`
`I enjoy every day.`
` I wish I could express how much I really do enjoy them better than by saying how happy I am.`
`Sometimes I even feel anxious because I enjoy every day so much.`
`There is as much misfortune and pain as there is happiness and pleasure in this world.`
`And I know very well that they all come to you regardless of how hard you try.`
`You'll have happy days regardless of how hard you try.`
`You'll have unhappy days regardless of how hard you try.`
`But, that doesn't mean that you don't need to try hard.`
`I can try to make my happy days even happier and last longer.`
`In the same way...`
`I can try to make my unhappy days happier and end faster.`
` I struggle very hard to achieve that.`
`That's why I'm going to enjoy the happy days I have now as much as I can.`
`I must not take them for granted, because they won't last forever.`
`They won't.`
` ...One day, all of a sudden,`
`these happy days will come to an end. I know it.`
`That's why`
` ...I was trying to enjoy the happiness I received today so that I wouldn't regret it`
` even if the world ended tomorrow.`
`I noticed my hands stopped moving while I was thinking about these things.`
`When spending time with my friends... I feel so happy that my heart might burst.`
`I even love doing the punishments.`
`They're fun for me.`
`I have friends.`
`I have a place where I fit in.`
`I have time in which to be myself.`
`I have a me that I love.`
`I love everybody.`
`I love Mii-chan, Satoko-chan, Rika-chan, and Keiichi-kun.`
` I love everybody in my class and everybody in Okinomiya.`
`"Oh?!`
` Rena's stopped eating!`
` I guess she went too fast in the beginning!"`
`"Okamura, this is our chance!`
` We can defeat Ryuugu-san!"`
`"All of you,`
` you're just`
` wasting your time!!`
` You think you can defeat me at Angel Mort?`
` You're too naive!!"`
`"Rena-san, come on!!`
` I'll never forgive you if you let Coach win!!"`
`"Heh heh heh!!`
` I'm not going to let anybody win!`
` I can even swallow the Pacific Ocean if you ask me to!!"`
`"What's wrong, Rena? Are you getting full?`
` I guess you just have to watch my`
` come-from-behind victory now!!`
` Am I right, everyone?"`
`"""Yeah!!!"""`
`"......Rena, what's wrong?"`
`I had left the table.`
`"Ahahahaha, excuse me.`
` I have to go to the bathroom."`
`I was just so happy.`
`I didn't care who won or lost this match.`
`Of course, it's more fun when I go crazy to try and win,`
`but I could never be happier than this.`
`If I could seal this happiness in a piece of crystal, I'd carry it around with me in my pocket.`
`I'd use it as heat to ward off the cold of hard days that are certain to come to me.`
`.........I know they will.`
`You're not truly happy when you feel happiness.`
`When you're bored with happy days and don't even realize that you're happy... That's when you've achieved true happiness.`
`You only truly feel happiness... when you're in a freezing cold environment.`
`That's the only time your heart can feel the warmth of even a small happiness...`
`On my way to the bathroom, I saw a waitress and a customer arguing at the register.`
`The customer was a woman.`
`The waitress was trying to explain that the lady needed a ticket to get a seat because the restaurant was holding an event today,`
` but the lady, saying she didn't know, was still trying to get a seat.`
`After a while, the store manager was called and started apologizing to the lady.`
`"...It's your fault.`
` You should've put a note outside that said we needed a ticket to come in, or somethin'.`
` How do you expect me to know when there's no mention of it..."`
`The lady's eyes met mine.`
`I guessed who it might be when I heard the voice, so I was prepared.`
`"......Oh, Reina-chan!`
` I didn't expect to see you here."`
`"Oh☆.`
` Hello!`
` Ahaha, what a coincidence!"`
`I held out my hand for a high five. She gave me one.`
`"Listen, Reina-chan.`
` They're so mean. They're saying that I can't get a seat because I don't have a ticket."`
`"Ahahahahahaha, it seems that way."`
`"...Well, I can't do anything about it, can I?`
` I can still buy some cakes to take home, yeah?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` You can choose anything you want from our selection."`
`The store manager gave her a fake smile and led her to their showcase.`
`"I like this cute one.`
` I think he likes simple ones like shortcakes.`
` Hey, Reina-chan.`
` What would you like?"`
`"What? Me?!`
` Are you buying me one?`
` Hauuuuuu!"`
`"Ahahaha, you really like cakes, huh?`
` You can get whatever you like."`
`"Umm... Ummm...!`
` Then... I don't know......`
` ...Ahaha, I'll take a shortcake as well."`
`"Really?`
` There's so many other cute ones."`
`"Ahahahahaha, everything looks so good... but shortcakes look the best.`
` Hau."`
`"Okay.`
` Give me two shortcakes and one petit trianon.`
` We're taking them home☆."`
`She imitated the smile I usually made.`
`I replied with the same big smile.`
`Then I smelled the strong scent of her perfume, and it made me sneeze.`
`"Oh, are you sick?"`
`Rina-san's perfume and I never seem to get along.`
