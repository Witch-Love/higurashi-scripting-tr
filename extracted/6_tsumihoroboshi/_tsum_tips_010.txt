`The danger of a culture-bound syndrome lies in the fact that it can easily trigger delusional misidentification syndrome.`
`That is to say, in the current case, every time the patient sees something trivial, she tries to interpret it as a "curse".`
`And it's believed that as a result of the accumulation of these events in an understandable form, a delusional system is created, ultimately leading to paranoia.`
`Furthermore, the patient is also exhibiting slight signs of a personality disorder.`
`Of course, it's at a very mild level, and it's not causing any hindrance whatsoever to the patient's daily life.`
`It's common for even healthy individuals to have primary delusions in their daily lives.`
`But they usually ignore it automatically without recognition, since those delusions are nonsensical.`
`However, there are cases where these delusions accumulate despite being incomprehensible.`
`It largely depends on the particular characteristics of the individual, and it's believed that the patient shows relatively strong characteristics in this area.`
`I believe you're very much aware that primary delusions are categorized into three different kinds.`
`"Delusional mood" is the feeling of impending crisis without basis.`
` "Delusional intuition" is the feeling of a sense of duty or goal without basis. `
`"Delusional perception" is the feeling of a baseless cause against a baseless target.`
`In the patient's case, it's believed that these incomprehensible delusions accumulated, acted out simultaneously with the`
` culture-bound syndrome, which triggered a delusional misidentification syndrome.`
`And it ultimately caused the incomprehensible delusions to become understandable by interpreting them as a "curse".`
`The comprehensible delusional system induces understandable secondary delusions, further strengthening the patient's delusional system with the passage of time.`
`("The delusional parasitosis" mentioned earlier can be considered a secondary delusion.)`
`A common factor of all cases of paranoia is that even after an outbreak, they still appear perfectly normal with no change in their personalities.`
`The patients are unaware of their own ailments, and due to their personal interpretations of their delusional system, `
`there are many cases where patients arm themselves logically, making it extremely difficult for a third party to point out that they're having a delusion.`
`Furthermore, although it may depend on the tendency of the delusions, there are also cases where a "persecutory delusion" turns into a "pursuit delusion" or a "conspiracy delusion," resulting in the patient creating an imaginary enemy and taking up anti-social behavior.`
`(For example, there are cases where believers of a religious cult were deeply influenced by the cult founder's paranoid visions, which shifted the group into a conspiracy delusion, and that made them conduct anti-social behavior in the name of self-defense. `
`Although no such cases have been reported in Japan yet, it could very well happen in the near future.)`
`Fortunately, the patient hasn't reached that serious condition as of now.`
`With proper treatment, she should be able to make a full recovery.`
`Please make sure that her father also understands that this is not an unusual case,`
` but something caused by the accumulation of a number of innocent factors that anyone could have.`
`The patient can be treated only by deepening her bond with her father. As long as she has that bond, she can certainly be treated.`
`For the reasons above, if the patient is to return to her home village, I strongly recommend that the patient continue to receive guidance from specialized medical institutions.`
`Please excuse me for writing such a long letter.`
`Thank you for reading this until the very end.`
