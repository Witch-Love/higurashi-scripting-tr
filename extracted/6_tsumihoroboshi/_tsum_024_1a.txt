`"Okay.`
` I'll send two of our subordinates to the clinic."`
`"I don't think she'll do it...`
` but you'll never know what's going to happen."`
`"Can we capture her by force if she does?"`
`"...Honestly, I don't want to do that...`
` What do you think we should do?"`
`"We made an agreement with the cops that we're going to give Rena Ryuugu to them right after we find her.`
` So even if we use force to capture her, we won't get in trouble."`
`"I'm not worried about losing face. I just feel sorry for Rena!`
` I really want to settle this calmly, if possible..."`
`"Well, she's still young.`
` So as long as she didn't kill someone or something, all she has to do is to apologize, and everything will be fine."`
`"Ah ha ha ha haa.`
` ...Well then, she might be out of our hands, ah ha ha."`
`"Oh, I mean, you know... As long as they don't find out about it, she'll be safe.`
` She'll definitely be safe.`
` ...Nobody really cares about the disappearance of those two anyway. `
`People think that they ran away somewhere because they did something wrong.`
` Those things happen all the time.`
` So, she's fine. Don't worry about it."`
`"She's out, she's safe, what? Are we playing baseball now?`
` Wa ha ha.`
` Anyways, please just be careful."`
`"Will do.`
` ...So, it's ok to capture her by force, right?"`
`"...Don't make any mistakes. You have to get her!`
` Please don't make it like a chase scene or anything like that."`
`I couldn't help but have a silly chat with Kasai-san.`
`When I put the phone down, I sensed Chie-sensei was looking at me.`
`...No wonder, as she had been able to hear the conversation clearly in this tiny room.`
`Chie-sensei put her spoon down, and with a sad look on her face, she asked the following:`
`"...Were you talking about Ryuugu-san?"`
`"Ah... yes."`
`"Sonozaki-san... do you know why Ryuugu-san ran away from home?`
` ...You're close, aren't you?"`
`It was hard for anyone to understand Rena's situation, except for me and Kei-chan.`
`So, most of them thought that Rena just ran away from home.`
`But after she did, the cops made too much of a fuss over it.`
`...Ooishi stupidly believed that the scrapbooks were a big scoop, and he overreacted in trying to find Rena.`
`He had patrol cars running around everywhere in the village. He even used the town council's phone directory to find her.`
`So, people in the village thought Rena did something wrong and was trying to run from the cops.`
`What was going to be difficult for me, more than finding her, was to make up a story to retrieve Rena's honor after they detain her.`
`...Hmm, what about this: Rena went for a walk, fell down and hit her head on the edge of some tofu, and lost her memory.`
` Ooishi misunderstood something big time, and he thought she was a criminal...`
`...It was too easy.`
`Anyway, we did make it clear that Ooishi was the one who misunderstood everything at the meeting the other day.`
`I had to make the best use of his name while he was feeling down for once.`
`What I'd have to do was to not make a big deal about this situation...`
` and to create an environment that allowed Rena to forget everything that happened, in order to get her life back together as soon as possible.`
`"Everything is going to be fine, Chie-sensei.`
` ...Rena is a little sick right now. That's all.`
` A fat cop somehow made a lovely mistake and got things twisted around. `
`You don't believe that Rena did something wrong and that she's trying to run from the police, do you?"`
`"...Of course not...`
` But... making her family worry by running away from home isn't a good thing to do, either."`
`...She had a fight with her father, and she ran away from home for a little while.`
`...She acted childish, and that's all. Maybe that'd be the best story to go with.`
`"I wonder if she had some problems she couldn't talk to anyone about.`
` ...I must be a bad teacher, because I never realized it...`
` I wish I could have sat down and talked with Ryuugu-san before all this happened..."`
`"Ahahahaha. Chie-sensei, you're taking it too seriously.`
` You need to relax...`
` It's normal for young kids nowadays to run away from home for a while!"`
`"Oh, nooooo. What am I going to do if Ryuugu-san becomes one of those bad kids and starts doing really bad things?!`
` Au au auuuu!"`
`Ryuugu-san becomes a bad kid.`
`↓\nShe does something bad and gets arrested by the police.`
`↓\nIt's her teacher's responsibility.`
`↓\nI'll be dishonorably discharged.`
`↓\nI can't eat curry anymore.`
`↓\nI'm dead.`
`"Oh, no. Oh, noooooo..."`
`...Chie-sensei seemed comically upset by her own imagination.`
`It looked funny, so I decided to leave her alone.`
`I made to leave the teacher's office to go back to the classroom, but...`
`Right then, the phone rang.`
`"Hello.`
` This is the Hinamizawa branch school."`
`Chie-sensei had to answer the phone all day today because the principal was on a business trip.`
`I exited to the hallway.`
`...Then, I heard the tone of her voice change.`
`"What?!`
` ...Wh-Where are you right now?!"`
`What?! I yelled and looked back at her.`
`It was probably Rena.`
` She called the school!`
`I tried to go back inside the teacher's office, but Chie-sensei gestured at me not to come in.`
`...Chie-sensei acknowledged what Rena was saying several times, and then, she looked up at the clock.`
`"Okay.`
` I'll be there.`
` ...I'm your teacher. You promise me, alright?"`
`She said only that, put the phone down, and got her purse out of her locker.`
`"Class president,`
` I have an emergency to take care of.`
` I'm going out for a while, so please have everybody study by themselves while I'm gone."`
`She took her car key out from her purse.`
`...It was obvious that she was going to see Rena somewhere.`
`"Chie-sensei, was it Rena?!"`
`"That's all.`
` You're in charge of the class, okay?"`
`Chie-sensei completely ignored me and she ran out into the hallway.`
`She ran to the schoolyard... and got into her car.`
`The moment her car left through the gate, I ran out to the schoolyard myself.`
`I headed for the black car parked near the gate and knocked on the window.`
`"How are you doing, milady?`
` Everything is quiet so far."`
`"I know!`
` But I need you to follow that car that just left!!`
` I think she's going to meet Rena!"`
`"Understood!!!"`
`"Rena is very paranoid, so you need to be careful.`
` Bring her to my house right after you catch her. After that, follow Kasai's orders!`
` She's my friend!`
` You better not get her hurt!"`
`...Rena must've told Chie-sensei that she wanted to talk to her alone.`
`I could tell that easily from the way she ignored my question.`
`I did feel a little bad for ruining their promise...`
` ...But it was very important that we caught her before she did something wrong.`
`We could still make up an excuse that she was just wandering around because she had a fight with her father and ran away from home.`
`...But if she set fire to the clinic or something, there would be nothing I could do.`
`The car made a rough u-turn on the gravel road, and it chased after Chie-sensei's car at full speed.`
`...I watched the car until it was gone.`
` ...All I could do now was to pray that this would be settled calmly.`
`"Hey, pay attention, everyone!!`
` Well, we need to study by ourselves for the rest of the class today!`
` So get back to your desks and study quietly!"`
`"...Self-studying?"`
`Mion ran up to me and spoke quietly.`
`"...Rena just called."`
`"What?`
` Really...?"`
`"Yeah, she just called the teacher's office.`
` I think Chie-sensei went to meet with Rena."`
`"...Rena... I wonder what she's going to do."`
`"I have no idea.`
` Anyway, I told my bodyguards to follow Chie-sensei's car.`
` ...I feel bad for Rena, but we're going to capture her there by force!"`
`"I hope it works..."`
`"They're used to doing this kind of stuff.`
` I'm sure they'll do fine."`
`"So, if they catch her, is everything going to be over?"`
`"Yeah.`
` We'll send her to a hospital.`
` If a doctor sees her, I'm sure he'll find a typical kind of disease or something.`
`It'll be like obsessive-psychosomatic disorder or whatever."`
`"............"`
`While we were spending our afternoon studying peacefully,`
` the members of the Sonozaki family would capture Rena, who was waiting for Chie-sensei somewhere. The problem would be solved.`
`...It wasn't going to be easy after that, but I was sure Mion would take good care of her.`
`And in the end, everybody would understand that Rena just ran away from home because of a silly fight with her father... A happy ending.`
`"..............."`
`"Problem solved, right?"`
`Mion winked at me. She looked like she already thought everything was over.`
`...But that just didn't sound right to me.`
`...I couldn't see any connection between Rena and Chie-sensei.`
`...It was hard to explain... but there was something wrong.`
`I wasn't saying that they didn't get along.`
`Rena was a good student, so Chie-sensei had a good relationship with her.`
`...But I just didn't understand what Rena wanted from Chie-sensei.`
`While I was thinking about it, the door opened, and one of our classmates came back from the bathroom.`
`With Rena.`
`"R-Rena...!!"`
