`Even if I turned on the light in my hideout, nobody would see it because of the piles of abandoned cars in the way.`
`...While I'm aware of that, I decided not to turn it on, just in case.`
`It's a bit scary to hide in this quiet place, alone in the dark, holding my breath.`
`I'd have to keep myself busy with something.`
`...But my brain won't work properly, and I don't even have the energy to think about what to do from now on.`
`However, I don't have the courage to lie down to sleep and regain my strength, either.`
`...Every time I heard or thought I heard a suspicious sound, I'd gasp and stare into the dark.`
` That's all I did all night.`
`Ooishi believes that the Sonozaki family was behind the conspiracy.`
`...But he can't do much without solid evidence.`
`For that, he has to locate the facility where they're doing research on the parasite.`
` ...But we have no idea where it is.`
`I think the Irie Clinic is still the most likely site, but I have no credible evidence.`
`Really, I don't think they'd do their research in a place so obvious even I could guess it.`
`They might be using one of the bomb shelters that was built during the war as some kind of secret underground research center.`
`Now that I come to think about it... I remember a secret building nobody is allowed into on the premises of the Furude Shrine.`
`I think it's called the ritual storehouse.`
`According to Miyo-san's research, the Furude Shrine is the center of the local worship of Oyashiro-sama.`
`The priest keeps the tools for ceremonies in the ritual storehouse. One of the ceremonies is the bizarre festival, Watanagashi, and so the shrine storage must be something very sacred.`
`If I remember right, Watanagashi was also a medical ritual designed to vaccinate and immunize people against the all-too-strong parasites.`
`That means the tools they used for Watanagashi were medical ones.`
`If my guess is right, the ritual storehouse is the most sacred place in the village, as well as the most appropriate building to use for medical purposes.`
` ...It's suspicious.`
`There might be a secret research center in the ritual storehouse.`
`...Ah, damn it.`
` The police should be performing a raid on the ritual storehouse, not the Irie Clinic.`
`Why didn't I think of that when I was talking with Ooishi on the phone earlier?`
`I hope Ooishi realizes this, too...`
`Should I go back to the phone booth and tell him about the ritual storehouse?`
`But when I thought that, I heard a car coming closer. I held my breath.`
`It's not normal for a car to come here this late at night.`
`I thought about many possible scary scenarios, which made me nervous...`
`After a while, I saw the headlights of the car near the former dam construction office.`
`The car must have passed by me and gone to the office.`
`...But it's a deserted empty office building. There's nothing there.`
`It's not a place where people would visit this late at night.`
`While I was staring into the dark, the engine of the car stopped, and its headlights were turned off. I could see two flashlights flickering in the darkness.`
`The lights moved into the office building.`
`...They must think I'm hiding there.`
`I held my breath and kept watch on their movements.`
`I can't tell who they are.`
`But I bet... they're pawns of the Sonozaki family.`
`They know that I ran away from home. They must be looking for me everywhere in the village...`
`...Though I needed to conceal my breath, my face started feeling itchy, and I had an urge to stretch my legs. My own body infuriated me.`
`The humidity made me sweat all over, so the back of my knees and my neck had been itchy for quite a while.`
`Scratching would make an unbelievably loud noise, so I decided not to scratch anymore.`
`...It usually doesn't make any noise when I just scratch some mosquito bites!`
`I'm probably just being nervous and overreacting.`
`...There's quite the distance between me and them, and I'm in the dark, holding my breath.`
`They wouldn't notice it even if I sneezed, let alone scratched myself.`
`...But I didn't want to make any noise at all. So, I tried to forget the itchiness. ...But after all that, I ended up scratching everywhere like mad.`
`I have to live in hiding like this for a while. I don't know how long I can go on when I'm so nervous on just the first night.`
`I need to toughen up more so I can remain placid, even in a situation like this.`
`I forced myself to relax, scratched my neck without hesitation, and tried to cope with the sticky sweat all over my body.`
`...I started getting hungry.`
`My stomach growled.`
`...That's a good sign, though, since it means I'm starting to relax.`
`I can't eat yet, though. It'd make a lot of noise...`
`I decided to wait until they finished looking for me and went away.`
`Go away. Go away.`
`I can eat if you go away.`
`...It seemed like the intentions I was sending out bore fruit. They had stopped looking around the building.`
`...However, I must have concentrated my thoughts too strongly.`
`They were pointing their flashlights in my direction.`
`...Did they notice me?!`
`No.`
` Not only that, they're walking towards me!`
`I made my body as small as possible, hid under the blanket, and listened for their footsteps as carefully as I could.`
`...All the while... I heard their footsteps coming closer and closer.`
`Since the footsteps are coming straight towards me, they must already know where I am, I think. It's scary.`
`But there's no way they already know where I am...`
`If they did, they wouldn't have wasted their time looking for me around the office building,`
` and they wouldn't walk as slowly as they did.`
`...It's just a coincidence that they're walking in this direction...`
`Since I'm hiding under the blanket, I can't see who they are.`
`I don't know where they're shining their flashlights, so I can't stick my head out from the window to see who they are, either.`
`I'd just have to stay motionless like a rock until I sense they're gone.`
`They stopped when they came near my hideout.`
`...I could hear their conversation.`
`"...I don't think she's here."`
`"Let's look somewhere else.`
` You look over there."`
`I could tell by the sound of their footsteps that they went separate ways and that each of them is walking around the piles of trash separately.`
`...I made this hideout out of an abandoned car. I just redecorated it.`
`So on the outside, it still looks like nothing other than an abandoned car.`
`...But once you look inside, you can instantly tell it's more than that.`
` So, if they look inside, I'm done for...`
`It's obvious that they're looking for me.`
`...Are they a Sonozaki Corps attack unit?!`
`If they find me... I'll be killed for sure!`
`I know all too well that this place is perfect for murdering people.`
`I killed two people here myself.`
`If I can do it, it'll be no problem for them, because they're real professional killers!`
`Even so, there's nothing I can do right now.`
`I just have to pray that they'll leave here soon.`
`At that time, I heard a slight beeping sound.`
`"...This is Atsushi. I can hear you loud and clear.`
` .........Yes.`
` ............Gogura?!`
` Yes, understood."`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"It seems like Rena Ryuugu is in Gogura.`
` Somebody saw her there."`
`"Oh man... That's it. We'll never find her now.`
` What are we gonna do now?"`
`"It's an order. We have to find her no matter what. We have to bring her to him.`
` It doesn't matter if she's in Sapporo or in Hakata. We have to find her."`
`"It'll be impossible to find her, though.`
` ...Do we still have to look?"`
`"...Rena Ryuugu has Miyo Takano's scrapbooks, and he wants them.`
` He was pretty upset about it, so I'm sure they're worth a lot."`
`"So, what are we going to do?"`
`"It seems like he recalled the others, except the ones who're watching her house.`
` So, we should go back to the office, too. Let's have some barley tea or something."`
`I heard their footsteps going further, and then I didn't hear them anymore. After a while, I heard the engine of their car starting.`
`I finally got out from under the blanket and looked outside the window.`
`The car made a U-turn and drove away.`
`The sound of the engine faded away into the darkness...`
`I heaved a sigh of relief.`
` I scratched at all of my itchy mosquito bites, wiped the sticky sweat off my face and neck, and finally allowed myself to cough.`
`I'd heard their conversation clearly.`
` They're the pawns of the Sonozaki Corps, without a doubt.`
`...It matches with what Ooishi told me.`
`And they said something very important.`
`They clearly said that they're after "the scrapbooks".`
`Up until now, I'd only assumed that they were chasing after me because I had Miyo-san's scrapbooks.`
`...I could've forced myself to believe that it was just my assumption.`
`But they said it loud and clear!`
`"We need to find Rena Ryuugu.`
` She has Miyo Takano's scrapbooks." That's what they said!`
`They also said that they're keeping watch on my house.`
`...I'm not surprised.`
`That's exactly what I would do if I were them.`
`I can't go back to my house anymore. It's out of the question.`
`...But... in fact, they said something way more important than any of that.`
`They said`
`......`
` "Rena Ryuugu was seen in Gogura."`
`If I was in a normal situation, I'd probably think that somebody saw a lookalike, and I'd laugh out loud.`
`...But the situation is different now.`
`Miyo-san was dead, but she was at the festival.`
`I'm here, but I was in Gogura.`
`...Miyo-san wrote about it in her scrapbooks... and I didn't want to believe it.`
`They're... coming closer to me... and I don't mean the Sonozaki family...`
`...Something beyond common sense is about to happen.`
`...Should I fight or should I run? I don't even know what I should do. I feel like I'm rooted to the spot with fear. Am I about to be eaten...?`
`...No, no, no...!`
`I don't want to be eaten alive.`
`I want to run away if I can't win.`
`If I can't run, I want to fight.`
`...I'm going to be happy. I know I am!`
` I'm not going to sit pretty and let them get me...!`
`But... the enemy Miyo-san foretold of in the scrapbooks is coming closer to me, and it's starting to eat me up.`
`I'm in the garbage dump, alone. If I disappeared right now without anybody knowing it...`
`The person who was in Gogura would replace me and start living my life.`
` ...Nobody would notice the change.`
`My father wouldn't notice it. My friends wouldn't notice it. <i>It</i> would replace me without having anyone noticed it...`
`Wait.`
` Many people close to me might've been replaced already...`
`That's right.`
` ...The Sonozaki family is plotting bioterrorism. But that's only a part of what <i>they</i> are planning.`
`Mice possessed by <i>them</i> don't get scared of cats.`
`As a result, they don't run away.`
`...They'll be eaten by the cats, and <i>they</i> can move into the cats' bodies.`
`...Mice are only used by <i>them</i> for that purpose. It's not that they lose their fear of cats in order to help <i>them</i> achieve their purpose.`
`The same thing goes with the Sonozaki family.`
`...They think they're doing things by their own will... but they're just helping <i>them</i> without realizing it.`
`That's exactly how they've lived since long ago, being the "parasite".`
` We're nothing but a bunch of mice to them.`
`Most mice are stupid. They don't even notice <i>their</i> existence. They help <i>them</i> to achieve <i>their</i> purpose, thinking they're living their lives by their own will.`
`...But very rarely, a mouse with wits is born.`
`This mouse notices that he's being used, and he also notices <i>their</i> existence.`
`...But nobody believes him, so it's not a big deal.`
`He starts thinking that it was his mistake, and he gets swallowed by <i>them</i>. Eventually, he disappears.`
`But even more rarely... a mouse appears from nowhere, notices <i>their</i> existence, and objectively proves it.`
`That mouse was Miyo-san.`
`To <i>them</i>... this mouse was a rare and very dangerous existence.`
`...That's why they resorted to unbelievably bold and violent methods to try and eliminate that mouse when it appeared.`
`But surprisingly, we knew... about those measures.`
`...But the stupid mice don't believe it.`
`...They don't notice that <i>they</i> are forcing them to not believe it, and that they're helping <i>them</i> in the end.`
`...<i>They</i> killed Miyo-san.`
`And... they tried to replace her.`
`But they made a mistake. We found the real corpse of Miyo-san.`
` That's why they failed to replace her.`
`...They'll try to kill me and replace me, too.`
`Or they'll replace my friends... in order to get close to me.`
`They'll look just like the real people... but they're totally different inside. They're an abnormal existence that's beyond our imagination.`
`I know... they'll appear.`
` No... They're already`
` here.`
`It appeared the day after Miyo-san died.`
`And it appeared in Gogura tonight.`
`...They'll keep coming.`
`They're openly after me now.`
`They'll keep coming... They'll keep coming...`
`Right then, I heard somebody coming down the slope.`
`I concealed my presence again, and I looked at the direction where the footsteps were coming from.`
`...I could see one flashlight.`
` ...It looked like there was only one person now.`
`...Who is it?`
` ...This late at night...`
`<i>Its</i> shadow is very small... I can tell <i>it</i> \nisn't an adult.`
`I felt a chill running through my body...!`
`<i>It</i> shined the flashlight towards my hideout, and <i>its</i> footsteps were coming straight towards me.`
`...It's different from the other guys earlier. I can tell by the sound of the footsteps that <i>it</i> knows I'm hiding here for sure.`
`...No... it must be just a coincidence.`
`...I should just conceal myself again.`
` I can make it through this again.`
`I made it through last time.`
` ...I need to hide. I need to hide...!!`
`I pulled the blanket over myself, made myself as small as possible, and kept telling myself that I was a stone...`
`But the footsteps kept coming closer and closer...`
`And...`
` <i>it</i>`
` knocked`
` on the door`
` of my hideout...`
`I opened my eyes wide. I broke out in a nervous sweat.`
`...Not wanting to believe that the sound I heard was a knock, my mind went completely blank.`
`But <i>it</i> knocked on the door again.`
`...I could feel a light shining on the blanket.`
`...<i>It</i>... might be shining the flashlight on me...!`
`But I still held back my fear.`
`...As long as I don't move, <i>it</i> can't put a finger on me... I kept telling myself that as if I was casting a spell. I tried not to shake in fear.`
`"...Hee hee hee."`
`<i>It</i> laughed.`
`...<i>It</i> has laughed at me because I thought I was still hiding perfectly.`
`But... I still tried.`
` ...Because if I got out of the blanket...!!`
`"...What are you scared of?`
` ...Hee hee hee."`
`"W...Woooooooooooohhhhhhhh!!!"`
`I threw off the blanket, and saw the owner of the voice.`
`...<i>It</i> is... Rika-chan.`
`...Now... Why is she here? Why did she come here to see me?`
`I don't understand why she came all the way here alone this late at night...`
`...I realized all of a sudden.`
`She looks just like Rika-chan... on the outside...`
` but she's not her. <i>It</i>`
` is just copying her appearance.`
`<i>It</i> came to Miyo-san, to me... and to Rika-chan...`
`I decided to talk aggressively on purpose in order to work up courage before my fear crushed me down.`
`"...Is that you... Rika-chan...?"`
`"...Meep.`
` ...Who else do I look like?"`
`<i>It</i> answers just like the Rika-chan I know.`
`...But I know it's not Rika-chan.`
`Rika-chan wouldn't come to a place like this so late at night...!!`
`"...I know who you are.`
` ...I know you're not Rika-chan."`
`"..............."`
`"...I'm afraid you can't deceive me like you can the others.`
` Even though you look just like her... I know you're not Rika-chan.`
` You're not my friend, Rika Furude.`
` ...Who are you...?!"`
`"..............."`
`Rika looked stunned for a while.`
`...She looked as if she didn't understand what I was talking about.`
`But... she pretended like that`
` for too long.`
`If she really didn't know what I was talking about, she wouldn't be able to stand the silence for this long. But she kept quiet.`
`And... she finally showed`
` her true character.`
`"...Hee`
` ...`
`hee`
` hee`
` hee`
` hee`
` hee."`
`<i>It</i> laughed.`
`...<i>It</i> laughed at me because I figured out something that was almost impossible to figure out; that <i>it</i> was not Rika.`
`"...Who`
` are you...?!!"`
`<i>It</i> didn't answer my question. ...<i>It</i> kept laughing for a while.`
`And then, <i>it</i> looked straight into my eyes in a way Rika-chan never did before, and <i>it</i> said this.`
`"I've lived for quite a long time.`
` ...But you're the first one who penetrated my disguise.`
` I always thought you had good intuition, but... you're pretty good.`
` Hee hee hee..."`
`"...............!!!"`
`...She clearly spoke to me the things that I was most afraid of... I was completely shocked.`
`It's like she told me everything that could possibly scare me.`
` I didn't want to hear any of this. It's something I can't possibly twist in a way I can comprehend.`
`"Let's just say I'm Rika for now.`
` ...It's been a while since I started to call myself that."`
`"...Oh, really...`
` It's been a while, huh?`
` Like how long...?"`
`"Not that long.`
` It's only been about 100 years."`
`"......Wh-`
`What...?!`
` What are you talking about?!!!"`
`I'm contradicting myself.`
`I know the person who's standing in front of me isn't Rika, but at the same time, I deny its existence.`
`...As long as humans hold this kind of emotion... they can never accept unknown existences.`
`...In other words, we can never accept "them".`
`"You don't have to be scared.`
` You're in the car.`
` I'm outside of it.`
` ...It's not easy for either of us to do something to the other.`
` I think this is a perfect distance between us. `
`No matter how long I've lived, Rika Furude is still just a little kid.`
` You're still stronger than me.`
` ...I should be more careful than you, because you could snap and jump on me anytime."`
`...I realized that this creepy thing that looks just like Rika was only here to talk to me. I felt my tension fade away a little bit.`
`But still... I don't know what she wants to talk to me about at a place like this, so late at night.`
`I'm like a fish on a cutting board.`
` ...There's nothing I can do other than to wait and see what's going to happen.`
`I waited for <i>it</i> to make a move for a while... And then, <i>it</i> opened its mouth again.`
`"...You're afraid of something.`
` ...Am I right?"`
`<i>It</i> uses sarcasm.`
`...Rika-chan's cute face looked uglier than ever when <i>it</i> smiled.`
`I held back my fear, and tried to reply firmly.`
`"Yes.`
` Thanks to you."`
`"So............`
` what are you afraid of?"`
`"...You should know that better than anybody else!!"`
`".........Hee hee hee."`
`<i>It</i> told me earlier that we were safe from each other because one was in the car and the other was standing outside.`
`But it's obvious that I'm the one who is being driven into a corner.`
`...While I'm talking to <i>it</i>, I could be being surrounded by <i>its</i> minions.`
` ...I got scared, and tried to listen to the sounds of my surroundings carefully...`
`"Don't be scared.`
` I came here to help you.`
` ...Hee hee hee."`
`"You came here to help me...?`
` Oh, really? I wonder how you're going to do that..."`
`"You're just sick at the moment.`
` You need medicine. That's all.`
` ...Would you be interested if I told you I brought it along?"`
`"...M-Medicine...?"`
`<i>It</i> put its hand in its pocket... and took out a small case.`
`<i>It</i> opened the case and showed me what was inside.`
`...What was in there made me gasp in surprise.`
`"...A s-`
`syringe............?!"`
`It's not normal for a person to carry around a syringe.`
` I have no idea what's going on.`
`...But what Rika-chan is holding in her hand is a syringe.`
` There's no way I can twist that fact around...!`
`"That's right.`
` The contents of this syringe are going to help you get better."`
`"It'll help me get better?!`
` Huh!!`
` I know what it is!`
` It's the drug that killed Tomitake-san!!`
` It's the parasite at its full strength!!`
` It'll give me the maggot disease!!"`
`"This is a different drug`
` from the one that was used on Tomitake.`
` I promise."`
`<i>It</i> giggled.`
`It isn't the giggling that scares me.`
`...I'm scared that <i>it</i> admitted the cause of Tomitake-san's death so easily!`
`And <i>it</i> also admitted the direct "cause" of the maggot disease that Tomitake-san died from!!`
`"...I know you're going to kill me in the same way he died!`
` And... that the Rena in Gogura is going to replace me.`
` Problem solved, right?`
` I'm not going to let you give me the shot!!"`
`"...Well, I knew you would say that.`
` This syringe looks very suspicious, of course."`
`"You're smarter than I thought...`
` So what now?!`
` ...Are you going to gang up on me and give me the shot like you did to Tomitake-san?!"`
`Tomitake-san's autopsy report said that he had bruises on his body that proved he was fighting against several people right before he died.`
`...That means they must've ganged up on him to give him the shot against his own will.`
`"...I'd like to give you the injection by force, but... it never really works.`
` So I gave up on doing that.`
` ...I decided to let you choose to take it yourself."`
`"Are you kidding me?!!`
` I don't want to take that creepy shot!!"`
`"...I thought about it many times.`
` I thought about how I could make you take the injection.`
` I can't force you to take it. I can't make you agree to take it, either. `
`...Then, it leaves me only one choice. I have to let you choose to take it."`
`"You should know my answer already!!`
` I'm not going to walk into such an obvious trap!!"`
`"......Well, that's what I thought you'd say.`
` I didn't expect you to choose to take it anyway."`
`<i>It</i> heaved a sigh, made a gesture as if <i>it</i> is mocking me, and smiled bitterly.`
`...It looked as if <i>it</i> was saying that I'm a lower animal that can't understand it's being given a chance for salvation...!`
`I kind of want to say I'll take the shot on a dare, but I know that's exactly what <i>it</i> is intending to do.`
`"Go back to your home and tell your friends that you failed to give me the shot!!`
` I'm not going to let you beat me!`
` I'm going to fight 'til the end!! `
`And... I'm going to seize the 1% chance of winning, and I'm going to destroy all of you!!"`
`"...I see.`
` ...Then, you should try to do that.`
` This world is going to end soon anyway.`
` ...Hee hee hee hee..."`
`"...End soon...?"`
`"It has nothing to do with you.`
` A frog sitting in a well doesn't need to have any interest in the world outside, does it?`
` Hee hee hee."`
`At this stage of the game, <i>it</i> said something very dubious...`
`I tried hard to understand what this horrifying creature was trying to say.`
`"...What... What are you going to do to me?!!"`
`"Nothing.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`"......What?"`
`...It's almost too easy.`
`...As far as I know, "do whatever you want" means ignorance or release when your enemy says it to you. At the very least, it isn't a bad thing.`
`Or... does it have another meaning...?`
`In that way, I overinterpreted the meaning of the sentence. But then, <i>it</i> said it again.`
`"Do whatever you want.`
` ...I'm not interested in 'this' Rena Ryuugu anymore.`
` I'm going to try to get along with the 'next' Rena Ryuugu.`
` ...I have to pray that the 'next' Rena Ryuugu doesn't have such good intuition. `
`...Hee hee hee."`
`I was scared of <i>it</i>, like I'd be scared of a judge handing down a death sentence.`
`"I used to try really hard to fix things every time a little problem occurred.`
` ...But I got tired of it.`
` ......I'm not interested in 'this' Hinamizawa anymore.`
` I'm going to find the 'next' Hinamizawa. `
`...But you only have 'this' one.`
` So, I hope you live as best you can."`
`<i>It</i> was telling me scary things one after the other.`
`This was obviously a warning of Hinamizawa's destruction. It means the climax is coming soon...`
`<i>They</i> have already prepared another Rena.`
`When I lose to this fate... <i>they</i> are going to replace me with that Rena as if nothing happened. They're very well organized.`
`What humans are most afraid of is for their lives to lose all value.`
`...Your life becomes worthless when you're told that you have a replacement.`
`It's like an indirect death sentence!`
`<i>It</i> closed the syringe case, and put it back into <i>its</i> pocket.`
`<i>It</i> turned around and started climbing up the slope...`
`At the top, <i>it</i> looked back... and spoke without as much as an evil smile.`
`"Well.`
` ...Goodbye, 'this' Rena Ryuugu.`
` ...I hope I can get along with the 'next' Rena Ryuugu.`
`...I shouldn't worry, because I do usually get along with 'them'.`
` ...Hee hee hee!"`
`"I... I'm not going to let you replace me with the 'next' Rena Ryuugu!!`
` I'm the only Rena Ryuugu!!`
` I'm not going to let you do it!`
` Never`
` ever!!"`
`I wondered if my scream was reaching <i>it</i>.`
`...<i>It</i> looked at me coldly.`
` ...<i>It</i> looked at me as if I was just an image of the past on a TV screen.`
`"It's fun to have a conversation like this once in a while,`
` huh?`
` Hee hee hee...\n`
`Ha`
` ha`
` ha`
`...!`
` Ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ...Aha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
` ha`
`......"`
`That laughter gradually disappeared into the darkness.`
`...<i>It</i> disappeared into the darkness as well.`
`I... was the only one left there.`
`I'm forsaken, and <i>they</i> don't care if I disappear.`
`<i>They</i> told me I should struggle as much as I want because it doesn't matter anyway.`
`<i>They</i> already have a replacement. <i>They</i> don't need me in "their" Hinamizawa anymore, because my intuition is too sharp.`
`...When I realized that...`
` I noticed that this garbage dump is a perfect grave for me.`
`Then I realized that this place wouldn't work as a hideout anymore.`
`I'd better start packing and move somewhere else.`
`<i>It</i> told me to struggle as much as I want.`
` ...I'm going to do just that, damn it... damn it!!`
`I have to get ready to move out from here.`
`I'm going to put everything back into my backpack. I have to leave here as soon as possible.`
`The light of the flashlight wasn't enough to see by, so I turned the table lamp on.`
`The light made things show up very clearly.`
`When I reached my backpack... I realized something and gasped in surprise.`
`The palm of my hand was covered with an eerie liquid.`
`I thought I'd wiped off my sticky sweat earlier.`
`...But it wasn't my sweat...`
`Then where did this blood come from...?`
`I realized it right away.`
`I was scratching the mosquito bites on my neck earlier... and I scratched them until it bled.`
`When I noticed that, I remembered the sensation, the mixture of pain and itchiness.`
`...I felt something moving near the wound on my neck, so I scratched it again to get rid of whatever it was.`
`My hand got sticky and wet with blood again.`
`...I can't see what the things are because I don't have a mirror... But I know.`
`They're already spreading throughout my entire body, causing the itchiness on my arms and the back of my knees.`
`...If I'd never experienced this before, I'd think I got bitten by a bad bug or something.`
`...But unfortunately... I already know what's causing this itchiness.`
`".........Why?`
` ...Why.........?"`
`I said it with hatred.`
` ...Why now? Why here...?!`
`It's... the maggot disease, without a doubt.`
`If I cut the veins on my arms, the dusky-red gross things would flow out.`
`But it's impossible. I didn't get any suspicious shots...!`
`But it doesn't have to be a shot.`
`...They might've put the drug in my food, and I might've eaten it without noticing...!!`
`I don't think they put it in the food at my house. But I used to share lunch with my friends at school.`
` ...They might've put it in the lunches...!`
`That Rika who visited me just earlier was shining the flashlight on me.`
`So, she knew that I was scratching my neck so hard it bled.`
`...Nevertheless, she acted like there was nothing wrong... and she told me that I wouldn't last long.`
`...Now I know why she was laughing at me in a sarcastic way... She... She knew that I wouldn't have much time left...!!`
`It itches very badly, but I can't scratch. The more I scratch, the itchier it gets... And I'm not going to do the same thing Tomitake-san did!`
`Damn it, damn it, damn it...!!`
`The itchiness might not be temporary.`
`It might actually get worse.`
`I don't know if it's going to stop soon or if it's going to last until I die from it... I don't know anything anymore. I just have to endure the itchiness.`
`I wiped the blood on my neck with a towel, clenched my teeth, and tried to erase the desire to scratch my neck.`
`The wound was throbbing.`
`...I wanted to scratch it so badly, but I couldn't do that. I fought back the desire, biting the end of the towel.`
`I scratched other parts of my body really hard in order to forget about the itchiness on my neck, but it didn't really work.`
`I just prayed for the itchiness to go away, closed my eyes, and fought back the desire. That seemed to be the best way.`
`I let my mind go blank, breathing hard for a while... I felt like the itchiness got a little bit better.`
`I took a deep breath, and I immediately started panicking.`
`Staying here is more dangerous than the itchiness.`
` I have to leave here as soon as possible!`
`I felt it while packing my stuff.`
`I felt the end coming closer. The end that Rika told me about earlier.`
`...I assumed I could live until the end... but I might have been wrong.`
`I might follow the same path Tomitake-san took...`
` way before the end comes.`
`I was sweating like crazy, and it felt so nasty.`
`...I know.`
`I know it's not sweat.`
` ...But I'm going to think that it's sweat for now...!`
`I wiped my neck with the towel, and hurried to leave.`
