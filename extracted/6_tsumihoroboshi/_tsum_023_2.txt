`It was Rena.`
`She was just... standing still under the light.`
`...I wondered how long she'd been there for...`
`It didn't look like she was going to ring the doorbell.`
` ...She was just standing there.`
`She seemed to be asking herself whether to ring the doorbell or not.`
`For how long had she been hesitating in front of my door?!`
`It looked like even standing was giving her a hard time. She looked very tired.`
`I ran down the stairs, put my sandals on, and rushed out of the house.`
`Rena looked surprised to see me, even though I came out after making a lot of noise.`
`"Rena?!`
` Is that you?`
` Rena...!!"`
`"....................."`
`She looked relieved to see me for a moment, but then she soon glanced downward and looked sad again.`
`"How long... have you been standing here?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` ...Maybe since the sun set."`
`Rena must've been staying somewhere outside for the last two days at the very least.`
`And it wasn't like she'd been camping for fun.`
`...She'd been in a state of high tension the whole time, believing that someone was trying to kill her.`
`...Rena looked utterly exhausted.`
`She seemed to have taken care of the deep scratch she made on her neck the other day with some large band-aids.`
`The band-aids had cute pictures, but that only made the wound on her neck look more painful.`
`...I saw some band-aids soaked with blood on her arms and body too, and I could tell she made them herself.`
`She had more scars than she had last night.`
`"Anyway, let's go inside.`
` You haven't eaten anything for two days, have you?"`
`When I tried to take her in the house, she refused with a vague expression on her face.`
`...It's wasn't that she didn't want to go into the house, it was more like she had to refuse because she thought she didn't deserve it.`
`"...I can't... take it anymore.`
` ......Even at this moment,`
` the maggots are moving`
` through my body.`
` ...It itches really badly, and... it feels like they're about to come out from everywhere..."`
`"...Rena... I think you have some kind of disease.`
` ...Why don't you get some rest here, and we'll go to the clinic first thing in the morning? `
`...He understands your delicate situation, so he'll see you in private..."`
`"No... no...`
` I know it.`
` ...I know exactly how Tomitake-san died.`
` ...I'm trying not to do what he did for as long as possible."`
`...Rena believed she was given some kind of suspicious drug that made her claw at her neck to death just like Tomitake-san did.`
`...She had convinced herself that it was going to happen.`
`...She wouldn't hear anything else right now.`
`...But she really wanted somebody to help her.`
`...She wanted help, but when someone tried to give her a hand, it looked like the hand of the devil.`
` ...If this was some kind of disease, what a horribly depressing disease it was...`
`"...Well, I...... I don't know how I'm going to die... but I don't think I have much time."`
`"...That's not going to happen!`
` You're a member of our unbeatable club, Rena Ryuugu! You're not going to die so easily...!"`
`"......Ahaha... thanks.`
` ......Well, I...`
` I wanted to say sorry before I die."`
`"Sorry?`
` For what...?"`
`"...Yesterday, I...... I said terrible things to you, and I hurt your feelings."`
`She must be talking about last night.`
`She trusted me... but when Ooishi-san told her about my past, she felt betrayed...`
`...And after that, everything I did out of goodwill seemed like the opposite to her...`
`...I know what it's like.`
` ...I once felt the same way about you... Rena...`
`"Well...... before I moved here...`
` I did many horrible things, too.`
` ...A lot, actually."`
`"...Really? I didn't know..."`
`"What I did is beyond comparison. You just shot someone with a toy gun.`
` ...I hit somebody's head really hard with a metal baseball bat.`
` Everybody got hurt really badly. `
`...And I also broke the windows in my school... and, and..."`
`I know... I know...`
`But... I don't care about any of that...`
`You did that before you moved here...`
`That's why you stopped being Reina Ryuugu and became Rena after you moved here, right...?`
`To me... you're my best friend who's very kind, thoughtful, and fun.`
`...That's the most important thing.`
`I don't care who you were before...`
`"......So...`
` I was way worse than you were.`
` ......I have no right to say you're not my friend..."`
`"I... I felt the same way, too."`
`"............?"`
`"...I`
` ...I was afraid of you`
` because I heard about your past."`
`"Oh...`
` You knew..."`
`Rena laughed sadly...`
`She seemed shocked to find out that I knew about her history, when she thought I didn't.`
`"But I was like, so what?"`
`"...Eh?"`
`"It doesn't matter how bad you were before you moved here.`
` ...You've been through ups and downs with tears and laughter... but since you moved to Hinamizawa, you've been living a proud life...! `
`The important thing is that you regret what you did. That's all that matters.`
` ...You've grown up to be a respectable person. I don't care about your past...!"`
`...I should've noticed it earlier...!`
`Rena is Rena.`
` That's why she's Rena Ryuugu.`
`I couldn't understand that simple thing when she said she wasn't Reina...!`
`"You heard about my past too, right?`
` ...I was pretty bad as well.`
` I was such a brat.`
` I regret the stupid things I did.`
` ...So, I thought moving here was a good opportunity for me to start over. `
`I believe I've been the person I wanted to be since I moved to Hinamizawa.`
` Isn't it the same with you, Rena...?`
` It doesn't matter how you lived in Ibaraki! `
`The important thing is that you're Rena Ryuugu. You wanted to be in Hinamizawa!`
` So, I don't care about whoever Reina Ryuugu was!"`
`"...............Yeah......`
` Yeah...... you're... right..."`
`"We can start our life over as many times as we want!!`
` We might make a lot of mistakes and hurt ourselves, but that lets us become the people we want to be...!`
` You fall once or twice in your life, but that's life. `
`We can't let that beat us down. We have to keep growing.`
` So... I was such an asshole for getting scared of you because of your past!!"`
`It doesn't matter how many times you fall!`
`When you go through a lot of pain, you can be kinder to others!`
`So, I don't need to know your past. And even if I knew, it shouldn't have changed the way I treated you.`
`But we were fools... We couldn't understand that until we went through things like this ourselves.`
`...Mion knew that from the beginning...!`
`We were such fools...`
` We hurt each other, and we made each other cry...`
`"So... Rena Ryuugu is and will always be my best friend forever.`
` When you have to go through a hard time... I'll help you no matter what... Trust me on that..."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I trust you, Keiichi-kun."`
`...It's very tragic, but what she said isn't true.`
`She probably didn't mean to lie.`
`...But ...I knew she didn't trust me from the bottom of her heart.`
`My words didn't reach her.`
`...I knew that because Rena kept telling me to trust her that time.`
` ...She kept saying those words`
` while I kept hitting her with the bat...`
` But they still didn't reach me...`
`"...I don't think I have much time left.`
`...But I'll try my best to save Hinamizawa, because wonderful people like you live here..."`
`No... Rena...`
`"I'm not going to let them take over this village.`
` ...I'll fight so we can regain the peaceful days we had.`
` ...I'll defeat their conspiracy..."`
`...She said that she trusted me... but she didn't understand anything I was saying.`
`...Even if I kept telling her that the conspiracy was Takano-san's delusion, it wouldn't reach her...!!`
`"...Thank you... Keiichi-kun.`
` ...Thank you for forgiving me..."`
`I do... I forgive you...`
`So... please forgive me for what I did to you...`
`"I'm going to save Hinamizawa, I promise.`
` ......So, Keiichi-kun,`
` will you help me...?`
` I trust you, only you, Keiichi-kun.`
` We can save Hinamizawa together."`
`"............Rena... Renaaaaa......!"`
`I knew how bad of a corner Rena was driven into.`
`...If I was her, I'd be walking around with a baseball bat, thinking every single person around me was my enemy.`
`...Rena cared about me so much, but I saw her as my worst enemy.`
`But Rena,`
` you still trust me...`
` even when you're driven into this bad of a corner...!!`
`I couldn't understand what you were saying... I beat you to death while you kept telling me to trust you...!!`
`But you're different!`
`You still trust me?`
`You are......`
` so......`
` so......`
`"...Why... are you crying...?"`
`"...I'm sorry... I'm sorry......`
` I'll never betray you...`
` I trust you, Rena...`
` So... please forgive me..."`
`"...I don't know what you're talking about.`
` ...You've always believed in me, Keiichi-kun.`
`...So I trust you too.`
` I can trust you, right?`
` You're the only one who trusts me, right...?"`
`Tears fell from my eyes.`
`I sobbed and nodded again and again to answer her.`
`...Tears welled up in Rena's eyes, too.`
`Before I knew it, we were putting our foreheads together with tears in our eyes.`
`"......Well.`
` I...... found a way to end this battle."`
`"...Really?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I might not stand a chance, but this is the best and only resistance I can think of."`
`".........Rena,`
` I don't know what you're going to do......`
` but if you do that...`
` we can regain our happy days, right...?"`
`"....................."`
`"We can, can't we?!`
` We have to!`
` Or I'm not going to let you go anywhere!!"`
`"...Ahahaha, don't worry, Keiichi-kun.`
` ...It's going to be a come-from-behind victory, and we'll regain our happy days for sure."`
`I don't know what she had on her mind.`
`...It began with a delusion, and it'd end with a delusion.`
`...If I encouraged her too much, she'd twist it into an attack on her.`
`I was like that at that time.`
`...I took Rena's goodwill as the complete opposite thing.`
`...So, I stopped denying her story.`
`This was... Rena's battle.`
`It was her lonely battle. She had to fight against her own delusion.`
`The more we tried to help her, the more we drove her into a corner.`
`But I would always be there for her!`
`Whenever she needed help, she could reach me!!`
`I wanted to let her know that... so, I said just one thing.`
`"I'm... on your side until the very last moment.`
` ......No matter what... I'm on your side..."`
`...Even if I told her to trust me... I knew she couldn't right now.`
`I knew that... but I told her those words anyway.`
`Even if she couldn't believe them, and if she tried to smash my head in... I'd say those words.`
`I'd keep saying them until I die...!`
`"Thank you, Keiichi-kun...`
` Everything will be over tomorrow.`
` ...We'll win for sure.`
`...And then, we can play around in the club together again.`
` With everyone.`
` We'll return to our happiest times."`
`...Although she wished to regain our happy times so badly...`
` I couldn't get rid of the darkness that controlled her mind...`
`"Well... I have to go now.`
` I have to get ready for tomorrow."`
`To tell the truth, I didn't want to let her go.`
` ...I wanted to stop her even if I had to grab her arm.`
`But... I couldn't stop her like that.`
`If I grabbed her arm... she wouldn't trust me anymore.`
`"Wait, Rena...`
` What do you have to do to get ready for tomorrow...?"`
`"...It's a secret.`
`I might ask you for help later... You'll help me when I do, right...?"`
`"Of course...!"`
`I nodded strongly so she could tell that I was still on her side.`
`But I didn't know what her "come-from-behind victory" meant at this point.`
`...The first thing I could think of is that she was going to invade the house of the Sonozaki family, which she thought was her enemy.`
`So, I called Mion to warn her after Rena left.`
`Mion laughed bitterly and said, "why does everybody want us to be the bad guys so much," but she understood the situation.`
`"...It'd be easier if we really did act like the bad guys.`
` It might be better if we tied her down and took her to a hospital."`
`".........If it comes to that... I guess we have no choice.`
` But... I want to... believe her.`
` Until the last second.`
` She still had the strong heart to trust me no matter how badly she'd been driven into a corner. `
`...She's not like me!`
` So, I'm sure she can defeat her delusion..."`
`"...It's hard for this ol' man to understand what you and Rika-chan have been talking about these days.`
` Did anything serious happen lately?"`
`You can say it happened "lately" in a way...`
`I killed Mion a couple of days after the festival.`
`"Ahahaha... I'm sorry I've been talking crazy lately.`
` Anyway... please don't lose confidence in Rena...`
` all right?"`
`"You know I won't.`
` Anyone can catch a cold of the heart sometimes.`
` It just happened to Rena this time, and that's all! `
`Well, she has a relatively high fever... But I'm sure she'll get better soon, and we can laugh about this later!`
` It's not as bad as you think, Kei-chan.`
` That silly Ooishi admitted his mistake. `
`He doesn't even know about you-know-what.`
` So, we'll just say Rena overreacted a little bit, and this will be over."`
`"Really...?!`
` You really think you can do that...?"`
`"Did you forget that I'm the next head of the Sonozaki family? I have both the skill and the power to do that. `
`This ol' man had a meeting with Ooishi at a restaurant today, and we cleared up all the misunderstandings!`
` Ooishi was shaking in fear the whole time.`
` Hey, I'm pretty good, don'tcha think?"`
`Mion bragged about her achievement, laughing loudly.`
`...I could tell she was exaggerating a little.`
`Anyway... compared to the sense of impending doom Rena seems to be feeling... the others seemed to be taking it rather easy.`
`It was all up to Rena now. If she understood everything... she could go back to the peaceful world she wished for.`
`We were waiting for her to reach out to us.`
`Just like we did by the abandoned car at the garbage dump that day...`
`Rena`
` ...I couldn't win,`
` ...but I know you can...!!`
` Because you're the one who told me to have faith until the end.`
` So I know you can win!!`
`That didn't mean that she could literally win the last battle she was talking about earlier.`
`But Rena would win.`
`She'd win, and she'd regain her peaceful life.`
